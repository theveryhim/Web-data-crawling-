        "abstract": "Abstract Staphylococcus aureus causes various life-threatening diseases in humans and developed resistance to several antibiotics. Lipophilic membrane (LLM) protein regulates bacterial lysis rate and methicillin resistance level in S. aureus. To identify potential lead molecules, we performed a structure-based pharmacophore modeling by consideration of pharmacophore properties from LLM-tunicamycin complex. Further, virtual screening of ZINC database against the LLM was conducted and compounds were assessed for Lipinski and ADMET properties. Based on pharmacokinetic, and molecular docking, five potential inhibitors (ZINC000072380005, ZINC000257219974, ZINC000176045471, ZINC000035296288, and ZINC000008789934) were identified. Molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) of these five molecules was performed to evaluate the dynamics and stability of protein after binding of the ligands. Several MDS analysis like RMSD, RMSF, Rg, SASA, and PCA confirm that identified compounds exhibit higher binding affinity as compared to tunicamycin for LLM. The binding free energy analysis reveals that five compounds exhibit higher binding energy in the range of −218.76 to −159.52 kJ/mol, which is higher as compared to tunicamycin (–116.13 kJ/mol). Individual residue decomposition analysis concludes that Asn148, Asp151, Asp208, His271, and His272 of LLM play a significant role in the formation of lower energy LLM-inhibitor(s) complexes. These predicted molecules displayed pharmacological and structural properties and may be further used to develop novel antimicrobial compounds against S. aureus. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma",

        "abstract": "2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) is a relatively new and promising insensitive high-explosive (IHE) material that remains only partially characterized. IHEs are of interest for a range of applications and from a fundamental science standpoint, as the root causes behind insensitivity are poorly understood. We adopt a multitheory approach based on reactive molecular dynamic simulations performed with density functional theory, density functional tight-binding, and reactive force fields to characterize the reaction pathways, product speciation, reaction kinetics, and detonation performance of LLM-105. We compare and contrast these predictions to 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), a prototypical IHE, and 1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazoctane (HMX), a more sensitive and higher performance material. The combination of different predictive models allows access to processes operative on progressively longer timescales while providing benchmarks for assessing uncertainties in the predictions. We find that the early reaction pathways of LLM-105 decomposition are extremely similar to TATB; they involve intra- and intermolecular hydrogen transfer. Additionally, the detonation performance of LLM-105 falls between that of TATB and HMX. We find agreement between predictive models for first-step reaction pathways but significant differences in final product formations. Predictions of detonation performance result in a wide range of values, and one-step kinetic parameters show the similar reaction rates at high temperatures for three out of four models considered.",

        "abstract": "Existing methods of cross-modality person re-identification usually use set-level global feature constraints to reduce the cross-modality discrepancy. However they often ignore the modality-specific and modality-shared local feature matching. Modality-specific local matching could help extract discriminative identity-consistent features and alleviate spatial misalignment, and modality-shared local matching could make identity-consistent features be correlated in two modalities and mitigate the modality misalignment. Therefore, we establish the intra-modality and inter-modality co-occurrence relation between identity parts. We observe the modality-specific and modality-shared local feature matching of identity parts as intra-modality and inter-modality low-rank relation-finding problems. Therefore, in this work, we propose low-rank local matching (LLM) approach to establish the intra-modality and inter-modality co-occurrence relation between identity parts. First, in order to reinforce identity-consist features in two modalities and correlate these cross-modality identity-consist features together, the local matching (LM) module is designed to estimate partial co-occurrence probability by measuring local feature similarity. Moreover, we propose cross-modality triplet-center loss (CTLoss) which adds global constraint for each class distribution in embedding space to alleviate dramatic data expansion due to modality variance. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the existing state-of-the-art. Our code is released on https://github.com/fegnyujian/LLM.",

        "title": "Thermal decomposition mechanisms of LLM-105/HTPB plastic-bonded explosive: ReaxFF-lg molecular dynamics simulations",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Thermal decomposition is not only related to the explosive’s ignition and detonation performances but also to their sensitivity to the surrounding environment. Based on the molecular dynamics method, the interaction and the thermal decomposition mechanism of plastic-bonded explosives (PBXs) composed by 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxidated (LLM-105) and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) were investigated using the reactive force field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-lg MD) simulations at 2000 K-4000 K. The interaction between the explosive and the binder effectively stabilizes the explosive crystal and reduces its sensitivity. The predicted activation energy of LLM-105/HTPB is 39.86 kcal/mol, more than that of the pure LLM-105 (36.57 kcal/mol), which reduces the initial decomposition reaction rate of LLM-105 after adding HTPB binder. Products distribution in thermal decomposition shows that the main initial decomposition mechanisms of LLM-105 include the C-NO2, C-NH2 bonds breaking, nitroso rearranging, NH2 elimination and H atom transferring. The H ions from the HTPB dehydrogenation delay the chemical bond breaking to inhibit the decomposition of LLM-105, and the reversible H transfer reactions provide an energy buffering area to reduce sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Based on the ReaxFF-lg reaction force field, the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities of LLM-105 decomposition at different shock waves were analysed. The equation of state, bulk modulus and pressure derivative of the shock decomposition process of LLM-105 were obtained. In addition, using Rankine-Hugoniot relationship, the detonation pressure was estimated to be 29.3 Gpa. The bond breaking of the molecular structure during the reaction was determined by the bond sequence, and the number of reactants, clusters and small molecules formed during the shock process was counted. Based on the obtained results, the decomposition of LLM-105 occurs when the shock wave velocity is greater than 8 km/s. The pyrazine ring in LLM-105 is connected by C–N–N or C–N–O–C to form the multimeric structure of LLM-105, accompanied by a small amount of hydrogen transfer, which is the main initial pathway for the shock-induced reaction of LLM-105. Subsequently, the multimer of LML-105 starts to decompose and finally forms small stable molecules such as N2 and H2O.",

MDS primarily affects older individuals, with the median age of diagnosis at 70 years. Prognosis and treatment decisions are guided by the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) criteria. Patients with intermediate, high, and very high risk MDS (HR-MDS) have a median overall survival (OS) of 0.8 to 3.7 years. Despite the high unmet need in this patient population, azacitidine (AZA) is the only approved therapy for HR-MDS that has improved OS in clinical trials to date. However, AZA treatment is characterized by low complete response (CR) rates (10% to 17%) with limited OS (< 2 years ), indicating a need for alternative therapies. Magrolimab is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody that blocks the macrophage inhibitory immune checkpoint CD47, a “do not eat me” signal overexpressed on tumor cells. Binding of magrolimab to CD47 leads to phagocytosis of tumor cells. AZA increases expression of tumor cell prophagocytic “eat me” signals, facilitating synergy with magrolimab. In an ongoing Phase 1b study, the combination of magrolimab+ AZA led to high response rates (overall response rate 91%, with a CR of 42%) and an acceptable safety profile without significant immune-related adverse events. ENHANCE (NCT04313881) is a Phase 3 trial comparing the efficacy and safety of magrolimab + AZA with that of AZA+ placebo in previously untreated patients with HR-MDS. Trial Design / Design and Methods: Patients ≥18 years old with previously untreated intermediate to very high risk MDS by IPSS-R are eligible for ENHANCE. Randomization is 1:1 to magrolimab + AZA or AZA + placebo with no crossover allowed. Magrolimab or placebo is administered intravenously with an initial 1 mg/kg priming dose to mitigate ontarget anemia. An intrapatient dose-escalation regimen up to 30 mg/kg is then administered through Cycle 1, 30 mg/kg weekly dosing in Cycle 2, and 30 mg/kg once every 2 weeks in Cycle 3 and beyond. AZA is administered per regional prescribing information. Patients may remain on treatment until disease progression, relapse, loss of clinical benefit, or until unacceptable toxicities occur. The 2 primary efficacy endpoints are CR rate and OS. For patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT), data for the CR rate will be censored at the time of ASCT, and OS will be censored at the last known alive date. Secondary efficacy endpoints include red blood cell transfusion independence rate, eventfree survival, minimal residual disease-negative rate, time to acute myeloid leukemia transformation, and patient-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Anemia response rate. Biomarkers of immune cell recruitment, immune cell signaling, and bone marrow penetration of magrolimab will also be explored. Status: As of June 2021, there are 62 sites active globally, including 41 distributed across the US. Patient enrollment began in September 2020, and as of June 2021, 144 patients have been enrolled in the trial. Planned enrollment is approximately 520 patients globally, and accrual is ongoing. PO-2 | Gastrointestinal Bleeding from Necrotizing Enterocolitis in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Treated with Arterial Embolization Ralph Gunarsa, Ricci Steven, Rio Hermawan, Joyce Bratanata, Cosmas Lesmana, Aru Sudoyo MRCCC Siloam Hospital, South Jakarta, Indonesia Introduction / Background / Significance: Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NE) is a rare intestinal complication in hematological malignancies, it characterized by bowel inflammation with wall thickening, edema, and necrosis. Although the exact pathogenesis is not completely understood, the main elements are intestinal mucosal injury, leukemic infiltration, and superimposed infection. We presented a case report of AML-M4 patient with severe intestinal bleeding as a main presentation of NE. Materials and Methods / Case Presentation / Objective: 22 years old male diagnosed with secondary AML-M4, he experienced GI bleeding before and during FLAG regimen, the profuse life threatening bleeding occurred at 18th day. He experienced fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea 3 days before the first GI bleeding. He had no history of any GI diseases nor a family history of it. The last GI bleeding production was approximately 750ml. Physical examination revealed pale skin and lips, anemic conjunctiva, tachycardia, and low blood pressure (60/40 mmHg). Fecal examination revealed positive C.difficle toxin, blood test showed very low hemoglobin level (3g/dL), severe leukopenia (40/μl), thrombocytopenia (30.000), and consumptive coagulopathy. He transported to ICU for further monitoring and management. In ICU, he still experienced GI bleeding despite a maximal supportive and medical treatment. He undergone arterial embolization to stop the bleeding. The procedure revealed contrast extravasation at right and media colic DOI: 10.1002/ajh.26351 Am J Hematol. 2021;96:S3–S33. wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ajh © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC. S3 artery, 4 coils applied to embolize the extravasated artery. After the procedure, the bleeding was reduced significantly, on the following days his condition is stable, and he transported back to the regular ward. Colonoscopy was performed to evaluate his condition, it revealed multiple ulcers with erosion all over the colon mucosa. Biopsy of the tissue revealed chronic inflammation with necrotic component. These findings consistent with necrotizing enterocolitis (NE). Results / Description / Main Outcome Measure(s): NE is a rare condition in hematological malignancies. The proposed mechanism was mucosal injury by direct toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents (ex. cytarabine), leukemic infiltration which more common in myeloid forms of leukemia, and superimposed infection as a result of neutropenic condition. The clinical presentations are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, abdominal distention, and life threatening complications of severe bleeding and perforations. It usually appears 10-14 days after completion of chemotherapy when the low leukocyte counts coincide. Imaging modalities by abdominal x-ray, USG, and CT could show thickening and dilated bowel, in this case due to neutropenic isolation condition, the procedure could not be done. Treatment of NE consists of bowel rest, supportive care, prompt antibiotic treatment, and invasive procedure including surgery. In this case, patient's symptoms occurred before the initiation of chemotherapy, and worsen after chemotherapy, this condition support the underlying mechanism are leukemic infiltration complicated by infection and chemotherapy agent. Severe GI bleeding despite maximum medication was successfully treated by arterial embolization. Conclusion(s): 1. In this case, NE occurred from 3 factors: leukemic infiltration, toxicity of chemotherapy, and superimposed infection. We considered the leukemic infiltration play a major role, because the symptoms occurred before chemotherapy. 2. NE in leukemic patients should be managed with multi-modal approach, in this case his NE was improved by chemotherapy to treat the leukemic infiltration, antibiotics for superimposed infection, and embolization for GI bleeding.

        "abstract": "The 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) is a newly energetic material with an excellent performance and low sensitivity and has attracted considerable attention. On the basis of the dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D), the high-pressure responses of vibrational properties, in conjunction with structural properties, are used to understand its intermolecular interactions and anisotropic properties under hydrostatic and uniaxial compressions. At ambient and pressure conditions, the DFT-D scheme could reasonably describe the structural parameters of LLM-105. The hydrogen bond network, resembling a parallelogram shape, links two adjacent molecules and contributes to the structure stability under hydrostatic compression. The anisotropy of LLM-105 is pronounced, especially for Raman spectra under uniaxial compression. Specifically, the red-shifts of modes are obtained for [100] and [010] compressions, which are caused by the pressure-induced enhance of the strength of the hydrogen bonds. Importantly, coupling modes and discontinuous Raman shifts are observed along [010] and [001] compressions, which are related to the intramolecular vibrational redistribution and possible structural transformations under uniaxial compressions. Overall, the detailed knowledge of the high-pressure responses of LLM-105 is established from the atomistic level. Uniaxial compression responses provide useful insights for realistic shock conditions.",

Although the initial thermal decomposition mechanism of LLM-105 has been studied based on quantum chemical calculations, the internal mechanism of the two-step thermal decomposition still lacks experimental research. Thus, this study involves a detailed experimental study to reveal the mechanism of the two-step thermal decomposition of LLM-105. The results showed that LLM-105 decay was a consecutive reaction. The first-step reaction dominated the early stage of the LLM-105 decomposition, and its products participated in the reaction of the second step. The cleavage of NO2 and NH2 groups of LLM-105 mainly occurred in the first step, while gaseous products NO and C2N2 were released during the second reaction step. The first-step reaction had a higher oxygen consumption rate and a lower carbon consumption rate, producing more heat due to more extensive oxidation of the carbon backbone. The difference in the oxidative ability and reaction rate between the two steps resulted in a two-step exothermic and mass loss behavior. This study provides further insights into the entire reaction process of LLM-105 and would be helpful for its better application and for the design of new explosives.",

Our tool has three primary objectives: First, it determines the hardware resource-boundness of a given application. Secondly, it estimates the initial cache partition size to ensure that the application performance is conserved and not affected by other processes competing for cache utilization. Thirdly, it continuously monitors that the application performance is maintained over time and, if necessary, change the cache partition size. We demonstrate LLM-shark’s functionality through a series of tests using six different applications, including a set of feature detection algorithms and two synthetic applications. Our tests reveal that it is possible to determine an application’s resource-boundness using a Pearson-correlation scheme implemented in LLM-shark. We propose a scheme to size cache partitions based on the correlation coefficient applications depending on their resource boundness.",

        "abstract": "Crystallization is one of the most important methods in the crystal habit control of explosive products. For this study, the antisolvent crystallization experiments were carried out to tune the crystal habits of 2,6-dimaino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxid (LLM-105). Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) was used as an organic solvent. Water, methanol, acetic acid, nitromethane, acetone, ethanol, methylene chloride, o-dichlorobenzene, and toluene were selected as antisolvents. The X-shaped, spherical cluster-like, rod-like, needle-like, and dendritic crystals were successfully produced by varying the kind of the antisolvent. These results manifested that the polarity and functional groups of antisolvent molecules played important roles in the crystal habits of LLM-105 explosive. The powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements indicated that these antisolvents just tuned the crystal habit of LLM-105 but did not change the crystal structure. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetry (TG) results of the obtained crystals showed that the crystal habits significantly affected the thermal properties. This study can contribute to the investigation of the mechanism of antisolvent-induced crystal habit modification and screen out the efficient antisolvents.",

        "abstract": "The effects of the GATA transcription factors GNC and GNL on chlorophyll accumulation can be explained by their direct and indirect regulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis genes. Chlorophyll accumulation and chloroplast development are regulated at multiple levels during plant development. The paralogous LLM-domain B-GATA transcription factors GNC and GNL contribute to chlorophyll biosynthesis and chloroplast formation in light-grown Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Whereas there is already ample knowledge about the transcriptional regulation of GNC and GNL, the identity of their downstream targets is largely unclear. Here, we identified genes controlling greening directly downstream of the GATAs by integrating data from RNA-sequencing and microarray data sets. We found that genes encoding subunits of the Mg-chelatase complex and 3,8-divinyl protochlorophyllide a 8-vinyl reductase (DVR) likely function directly downstream of the GATAs and that DVR expression is limiting in the pale-green gnc gnl mutants. The GATAs also regulate the nucleus-encoded SIGMA (SIG) factor genes, which control transcription in the chloroplast and suppress the greening defects of sig mutants. Furthermore, GNC and GNL act, at the gene expression level, in an additive manner with the GOLDEN2-LIKE1 (GLK1) and GLK2 transcription factor genes, which are also important for proper chlorophyll accumulation. We thus reveal that chlorophyll biosynthesis genes are directly controlled by LLM-domain B-GATAs and demonstrate that these transcription factors play an indirect role in the control of greening through regulating SIGMA factor genes.",

        "abstract": "Conventional design and optimization of Photonic Crystal Surface Emitting Lasers (PCSEL) usually requires expert knowledge in semiconductor physics and optimization algorithms, which is also known as the inverse design problem. However, with the trend towards automation and depersonalization of the entire integrated circuits (IC) industry, the conventional method, with the drawback of being relatively labor-intensive and sub-optimal, warrants further refinement. This technical dilemma remained until the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard. This paper explores the possibility of applying LLMs to machine learning-based design and optimization of PCSELs. Specifically, we utilize GPT3.5 and GPT4. By simply having conversations, GPT assisted us with writing Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation code and deep reinforcement learning code to acquire the optimized PCSEL solution, spanning from the proposition of ideas to the realization of algorithms. Given that GPT will perform better when given detailed and specific questions, we break down the PCSEL design problem into a series of sub-problems and converse with GPT by posing open-ended heuristic questions rather than definitive commands. This paper shows that LLMs, such as ChatGPT, can guide the nanophotonic design and optimization processes, on both the conceptual and technical level, and we propose new human-AI co-design strategies and show their practical implications. We achieve a significant milestone for the first step towards an automated end to end nanophotonic design and production pipeline.",

        "abstract": "BS It has been known for a long time that Hodgkin lymphoma is susceptible to T-cell immune-mediated treatment. As researchers at Baylor College of Medicine, my colleagues and I evaluated the possibility of using T cells to target the Epstein-Barr virus, which is expressed in approximately 40% of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. We found that targeting antigens associated with this virus with specific T cells can reduce disease progression and thereby induce complete remissions, which can be sustained in a good number of patients. A drawback to this approach is that only a small subset of patients is eligible for treatment. When looking for an alternative, we focused on CD30, which is expressed by all malignant Reed–Sternberg cells in Hodgkin lymphoma. At the time, there was evidence that brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris, Seagen), an antibody-based immunotherapy, successfully targeted this molecule. Like all antibodies, brentuximab vedotin has some transient effects. Brentuximab vedotin is also associated with some neuropathy. We aimed to leverage the success of CAR T-cell therapy, combining the CD30 antibody–based specificity with the potent cytotoxic activity of T cells. By targeting CD30, treatment would be broadly applicable to all patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. It also offers the opportunity to overcome some of the other strategies that this tumor employs to bypass immune recognition because CAR T cells do not require an intact antigen-presentation machinery for tumor targeting.",

        "abstract": "Leakage detection and localization in pipelines has become an important aspect of water management systems. Since monitoring leakage in large-scale water distribution networks (WDNs) is a challenging task, the need to develop a reliable and robust leak detection and localization technique against degradation mechanisms is essential for loss reduction in potable networks. This paper presents a review of all the past relevant investigations to demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of the existing leakage detectionmethods (LDMs) and leakage localization methods (LLMs) in the context of those degradation mechanisms that are inevitable in pipes and joints. We find that extensive research efforts have been reported in relation to leakage detection and localization technologies. However, very little discussion is available to justify the suitability of a leakage detection method for a given degradation mechanism. The existing review papers do not cover or connect past efforts from the start of a degradation mechanism that leads to changes in the mechanical strength (such as a reduction in fracture toughness) of pipes and results in crack propagation and leakage. In this paper, we provide discussion of all these interrelated and inter-dependent stages. Using this discussion, the effectiveness of existing LDMs and LLMs in respect of prominent degradation mechanisms is analysed and the key challenges in the current methods are highlighted.",

        "abstract": "2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) is a highly promising energetic material (EM) with high safety. Understanding its microscopic response mechanisms within the external stimulus is meaningful for the design of EMs. In order to comprehend the complicated phenomena, it is necessary to employ molecular simulation methods to investigate the response mechanisms with the force field (FF) at an atomic level. In this work, we developed a tailored FF for LLM-105 based on first-principles calculations. The validity of the FF was evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. The structural parameters of LLM-105 predicted by FF are in good agreement with the experimental values, such as lattice constant, bond length, bond angle, dihedral angle and center of mass, and so forth. Moreover, the FF possesses good performance to describe the structural response on pressure accurately. In general, our work not only builds a balanced FF in gas and condensed phases, but also provides a useful tool to study the properties about LLM-105 at a large scale, which is helpful to improve the understanding about the balance between energy and safety in EMs.",

        "abstract": "New energetic material 2,6-diamino-3,5dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (C4H4N6O5, LLM-105) maintains its structure stability under high pressure below 30 GPa at room temperature or in the temperature range from 513 K to 5 K with ambient pressure based on the high pressure or the cryogenic XRD patterns. One structural phase transition occurs at about 30 GPa and is confirmed by pressure-dependent Raman and infrared spectra. The structure of LLM-105 crystal shows anisotropic compressibility under pressure in the order βb >βa > βc and anisotropic thermal expansion in the order αb>αc≈αa. Debye temperature of 1225 K for this crystal is obtained based on the lattice parameters at different pressure or temperature. Raman and infrared spectra at extreme conditions suggest that the structure stability is contributed to the stronger interand intramolecule hydrogen bonding networks within LLM-105 crystal. The symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of amino groups are coupled and promote the understanding of pressure evolution of LLM-105 crystal. The bond constants of amino groups with different pressure and temperature are also obtained. For studying the electronic structure evolution process of LLM-105 crystal under high pressure, the experiments of photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as absorption spectroscopy and the DFT calculations were employed. With the pressure increasing, the luminescence of LLM105 crystal first increases because the hydrogen bond network limits molecular vibration, then over 9.0 GPa, the intensity decreases due to the lower electronic transfer efficiency. Results reveal that the band gap of LLM-105 crystal presents a strong pressure dependence. The high pressure phase transition has also been observed at about 30 GPa with a band gap suddenly decrease again.",

These are dual to half-BPS states of N=4 SYM. We find that the language of code subspaces is natural for discussing the set of nearby states, which are built by acting with effective fields on these backgrounds. This work extends our previous work by going beyond the strict infinite N limit. We further discuss how one can extract the topology of the state beyond N→∞ and find that, as before, uncertainty and entanglement entropy calculations provide a useful tool to do so. Finally, we discuss obstructions to writing down a globally defined metric operator. We find that the answer depends on the choice of reference state that one starts with. Therefore, within this setup, there is ambiguity in trying to write an operator that describes the metric globally.",

These rapid speeds produce well-resolved spectra that aid in the study of the chemical and structural properties of this material. Extraordinarily long 1H T1 values were observed for the main amine peaks from the LLM-105 explosive and can be used to differentiate between peaks from the main compound and those of impurities. Further, advanced NMR measurements and simulations reveal unique spectral properties due to the strong network of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonding and provide insights in the structure of LLM-105.",

In this paper, a new structure has been proposed for fault detecting and identifying (FDI) of high-dimensional systems. This structure consist of two structure. The first part includes Auto-Encoders (AE) as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to produce feature engineering process and summarize the features. The second part consists of the Local Model Networks (LMNs) with LOcally LInear MOdel Tree (LOLIMOT) algorithm to model outputs (multiple models). The fault detection is based on these multiple models. Hence the residuals generated by comparing the system output and multiple models have been used to alarm the faults. To show the effectiveness of the proposed structure, it is tested on single-shaft industrial gas turbine prototype model. Finally, a brief comparison between the simulated results and several related works is presented and the well performance of the proposed structure has been illustrated.",

        "abstract": "LLM-105 (2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide) is an insensitive high explosive crystal which has performance between that of HMX and TATB. An elastoviscoplastic dislocation model is developed for LLM-105 crystal, which accounts for the dislocation evolutions at the crystal interior and crystal wall and strain-rate dependent work hardening. Three different crystal morphology (cubic, icosahedral, rodlike) of LLM-105 based explosive computational models were constructed and subjected to an impact velocity of 200 m s−1 and 500 m s−1. Effects of crystal morphology and initial dislocation density on thermomechanical ignition behavior of LLM-105 based explosives were analyzed. Dislocation density of both crystal interiors and crystal walls in the rodlike LLM-105 based explosive increases slower than that in the cubic and icosahedral explosives. Both the volume averaged and localized stress and dislocation density are the lowest for the rodlike explosive. At the impact velocity of 500 m s−1, a temperature rise due to volumetric work, plasticity work and chemical reaction is sufficiently high to lead to the ignition of the cubic explosive, which shows that the rodlike explosive is the least sensitive among the three explosives. Moreover, with the increase of initial dislocation density, the corresponding volume averaged and localized stress and temperature increase as well. Results presented bridge the macroscale thermomechanical ignition response with the mesoscale deformation mechanisms, which is essential for better understanding the ignition mechanisms and guiding the design of LLM-105 based formulations.",

        "abstract": "The high-pressure behavior of 3,4-bis(4-nitro-1,2,5-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,2,5-oxadiazole (LLM-172) has been studied to 36 GPa by Raman spectroscopy and 50 GPa by X-ray diffraction. The Raman spectra and calculated unit-cell volumes at select pressures show reasonable qualitative agreement with first-principles density functional theory calculations. Raman peaks exhibit a gradual broadening and loss of intensity upon compression to near 20 GPa. Above 20 GPa, most Raman features disappear with the exception of modes associated with the skeletal ring modes. These modes were found to persist (although with low intensity) to 36 GPa. Because these modes exhibit very low compressibility over the pressure range studied, it is speculated that the ring structure is very stable. The X-ray diffraction suggests that while the crystal maintains an orthorhombic structure to near 40 GPa, it gradually undergoes a decomposition/amorphization beginning near 10 GPa. Analysis of the Raman results suggests that decomposition proceeds through isomerization, which leads to the formation of a C-O-N-O group rather than ring cleavage.",

This project was developed in the intermediate French course in LLM program at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana de Bogota, and it took a sample of 3 teachers of the above-mentioned course. \n \nIn order to accomplish the research project’s goals, the conceptual framework was constructed from the following concepts: Teaching of Foreign Languages Krashen and Terrel (1983), culture and language Kramsch (1996), Bernabe (2012), Serrano (1980), Zambrano (2009), Hymes communicative competence ( 1972), Byram (1997), Rincon (2004), Kramsch (2001), Intercultural Communication Competence Byram (1997), Corbett (2003), Bennett (2008), Byram (2008), Intercultural Awareness Bennett (2004), Zarate ( 1993), Kandeel (2013), the intercultural dimension in the teaching of foreign languages (Alcala, 2004) (Paricio, 2004); teacher training with an intercultural approach (Levy, 1983) (Sandoval, E., Guerra, E., Contreras, R., 2010) and, finally, material design by Tomlinson (2012), Rico (2013). \n \nThe investigative approach of the research project was conceived as action research, considering that the final proposal was a didactic sequence for the development of Intercultural Consciousness. In order to accomplish it, two data collection techniques were used: open standardized surveys, and qualitative observations in which the researchers had a passive participation. From the techniques used, the researchers sought to study and identify the following elements: initially, the follow-up of the French silabo and the inclusion of the Intercultural Consciousness in it, and, in addition, the material used in class and the way in which this material could develop Intercultural Consciousness. \n \nBased on the two expert teachers evaluation of the didactic sequence La francophonie autour du monde, it was determined that this proposal promotes the development of IC. Based on the activities included, it was also stablished that the development of this component in the training of future teachers in foreign languages is nurturing.",

Certification of metallic impurities in LLM-105 and FOX-7 was achieved by the microwave digestion-assistant inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry method. The contents of metallic impurities, including Na, K, Ca, Cr, Ni, Fe, Mg, Al, Co, Cu and Zn, in several LLM-105 and FOX-7 samples were accurately detected under the optimal conditions. And the detected results suggested that recrystallization was an effective method for high-purity explosive reference materials.

Los resultados evidencian una polisemia del término, lo cual sugiere una diversidad amplia de acercamientos metodológicos en las aulas. \nDurante el proceso de investigación, surgió una discusión sobre las diferencias entre escritura en L1 —español— y L2—inglés y francés— y sobre la pertinencia de crear diálogos entre las distintas áreas del programa, para así establecer criterios claros de evaluación y retroalimentación de los textos. Finalmente, se concluyó que es necesario discutir sobre lo disciplinar en los estudios de lenguas porque, sin un campo de estudio delimitado y compartido, los procesos de escritura académica se verán obstaculizados.",

The aim of the article is to analyze hallmarks of this LLM programme. The method of analysis and synthesis of legal and scientific-methodical sources was used to assess the level of the research problem topicality. The method of generalization was applied to formulate the conclusions of the article. The School of International Arbitration (SIA) was established in 1985 at Queen Mary University of London. The School has been constantly increasing its impact over the years, both in terms of research and teaching, and now it is considered a leading contributor to the science of international arbitration and litigation. Among other options the School proposes the LLM programme in Comparative and International Dispute Resolution which aims to provide a new generation of lawyers with a deep understanding of the special characteristics and needs of international arbitration, help them rethink traditional approaches to conflict resolution what is achieved by a solid theoretical grounding, broad interdisciplinary training, practice-oriented approach to the teaching of arbitration, enshrining such personal traits as individual commitment, determination and willingness to work, development of cognitive and transferable skills which help to prepare for the transition to working life. The hallmarks of LLM in Comparative and International Dispute Resolution Queen Mary enable a graduate to become a valuable asset of any organization or institution which activity is connected with international arbitraton.",

The objectives of this study are to extend the correction algorithm to full swath width without any assumptions. For a target class only distributed on one or both sides of the image, interpolation or extrapolation of the confidence interval is realized using the linear regression technique based on the exponential model. The position of the reference band is then determined and the correction is performed. Experiments were performed on ENVISAT ASAR and RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR data.

This works investigate the structure evolution of LLM-105 crystal under high pressure up to 32GPa by Raman spectroscopy. The results display that there exist two phase transitions occuring at 10 and 17 GPa, respectively. This conclusion is consistent with the previous theoretical calculation. With further loading above 17 GPa, the broadening of Raman peaks and the peak shifted to high wavenumber mean that the LLM-105 had a tendency to evolve to amorphous state. Moreover, two different crystal growth directions in the LLM-105 twin crystal are identified by using Raman spectra.",

        "abstract": "In order to keep pace with the changing demands of our distance learning master’s students and to take advantage of advances in technology, in 2016 the interactive delivery of the LLM Employment Law in Practice began, replacing the traditional work book style delivery. \n \nThe new model delivery is designed to encourage and support the distance learning students to become part of a collaborative learning community. The delivery of the module is via Blackboard and includes discussion boards, virtual classrooms using Blackboard collaborate, and materials provided through the eXe learning tool. The design is to encourage online communities to flourish by offering a variety of opportunities for the students to interact with their peers. \n \nThe eXe learning tool is an open source authoring application to assist academics in providing materials electronically on the web, but do not require the academic to have advanced programming skills etc. The finished materials offer a much more modern look that is user friendly and a digestible method of providing the materials. The application means that the students can keep pace and measure their learning as it offers a wide variety of instant formative feedback. The summative assessment is also marked electronically giving the student instant access to their mark, individual feedback and feedforward comments. \nThis paper explores our journey from old style delivery to a modern technology based online delivery. The trials and tribulations, the significant development of our information technology skills, the lessons learned and initial student feedback from a cohort who had optional access to both types of delivery.",

        "abstract": "Organic Nonlinear optical (NLO) single crystals of L-Leucinium Hydrogen Maleate (LLM) have been grown by the slow evaporation solution growth technique at room temperature. The X-Ray diffraction studies proved that the LLM crystals belong to monoclinic system with noncentrosymmetric space group (C2). The decomposition and thermal strength of the LLM crystals were established by TGA/DTA studies. UV-vis-NIR absorption study shows good transparency of the LLM crystal and the lower cutoff wavelength was found to be 212 nm. The optical band gap, reflectance, refractive index and electrical susceptibility were also calculated. Second order efficiency of the LLM crystal was determined using Kurtz and Perry powder technique. Third order nonlinear studies were performed using Z-Scan technique. Nonlinear parameters such as nonlinear refractive index, absorption coefficient, and nonlinear optical susceptibility were evaluated for the LLM crystal. Introduction. Amino acid is one of the rich choice for NLO material because of its coherent blue green laser generation and frequency doubling applications. Amino acids are promissing candidate for its chirality, weak vanderwaals and hydrogen bonds, the absence of strongly conjugated bonds, wide transparency, bands in the visible and UV spectral regions and zwitter ionic nature of the molecule which is important for crystal hardness [1]. In the crystal engineering and supramolecular point of views L-Leucine is an interesting molecule compared to other amino acid materials and it is an essential branched chain of alpha amino acid [2]. Many optically active aminoacids show highly efficient second harmonic generation. Maleic acid forms crystalline maleate of various organic molecules through hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions. In maleic acid the intramolecular hydrogen bond is very strong and has large π-conjugation has attracted our attention [3]. In this paper, it is reported on growth of L-Leucinium Hydrogen Maleate (LLM) single crystal followed by characterizations like XRD, TG-DTA, UV-Vis-NIR and NLO studies are discussed in detail.",

El objetivo principal es identificar las concepciones en torno a la escritura a partir de las cuales la Licenciatura en Lenguas Modernas (LLM) brinda a sus estudiantes estrategias para escribir en un lenguaje academico a lo largo del curriculo. \nPara la base teorica, se hizo un barrido historico de los estudios sobre escritura en la linguistica y se revisaron algunos aportes concernientes al concepto escritura academica. Los resultados evidencian una polisemia del termino, lo cual sugiere una diversidad amplia de acercamientos metodologicos en las aulas. \nDurante el proceso de investigacion, surgio una discusion sobre las diferencias entre escritura en L1 —espanol— y L2—ingles y frances— y sobre la pertinencia de crear dialogos entre las distintas areas del programa, para asi establecer criterios claros de evaluacion y retroalimentacion de los textos. Finalmente, se concluyo que es necesario discutir sobre lo disciplinar en los estudios de lenguas porque, sin un campo de estudio delimitado y compartido, los procesos de escritura academica se veran obstaculizados.",

Likewise, this research emerges taking into account the relevant influence of beliefs and the importance of culture in the process of learning and teaching English. \nTo accomplish this objective, the investigative approach used was a mixed approach carried out in two phases. In the quantitative phase, a Likert questionnaire was applied to nine English teachers and another questionnaire of the same type, to a course of each level of English, with the result of a participation of eighty-nine students. Later, in the qualitative phase, four English teachers were interviewed and two focus groups were conducted in two English courses. \nThe theoretical framework of this research is composed by the concepts of culture, intercultural communicative competence, culture within the learning of a foreign language and beliefs of teachers and students. The results suggest that both teachers and students believe that English and its cultural component can not be separated. Moreover, they agree that introducing cultural aspects makes English learning more efficient and at the same time allows students to be more involved. Finally, teachers and students agree on the importance of intercultural communicative competence. \nKey words: Intercultural communicative competence, beliefs, culture, English as a foreign language.",

        "abstract": "Based on the need to recognize learning strategies to favor the speaking skill of French \nlearners at the A2 level of the Bachelor of Modern Languages, it was necessary a complementary \nmaterial within the methodology of the student and the teacher that offers versatility in terms of \nexercises and activities. Therefore, the present research explores the possibility to dynamize the \noral production practices of French, through the use of a material that contains the learning \nstrategies that the students of pre-intermediate French use with less recurrence. To achieve this, \nthe learning strategies used in a greater and lesser recurrence by the students during the oral \nproduction exercises developed in class were identified and classified, in order to have them as a \nbasis for the creation of the proposal of the material. \nThe theoretical and conceptual foundations that govern this research, are shaped by the \ndefinition of Learning Strategies given by Oxford (1990) which in turn provides a broad and \nconcise classification of the type of strategies, the design of material provided by Tomlinson \n(1990), the communicative competence provided by Hymes (1971) and Bachman (1995), and, \nfinally, the speaking skill that we picked up from Fernandez (2002) and the conception that the \nCommon European Framework of Reference has specifically at level A2 of the language. \nThis is a qualitative research with a descriptive scope. For data collection, two semi-guided \ninterview scripts were created, one aimed at the teachers and the other directed at the students \nrespectively. On the other hand, the typology of learning strategies proposed by Oxford (1990) \nwas taken into account in order to observe oral production in pre-intermediate level French \nclasses. \nThe results of the analysis, allowed to recognize that the students do not use social, affective \nand memory learning strategies in their oral production practices, but they use with a high \nfrequency meta-cognitive learning strategies and compensation learning strategies. Additionally, \non the part of the professors the lack of an extra material that focuses on working the oral \nproduction through different dynamics was evidenced. In this way, it was finally possible to \nrespond to the objectives that governed this research, having as final product a material proposal, \nwhich can be taken up by future researchers to be implemented in other contexts similar to the \none studied.",

        "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential on simple tasks, their breadth of scope, lack of transparency, and insufficient controllability can make them less effective when assisting humans on more complex tasks. In response, we introduce the concept of Chaining LLM steps together, where the output of one step becomes the input for the next, thus aggregating the gains per step. We first define a set of LLM primitive operations useful for Chain construction, then present an interactive system where users can modify these Chains, along with their intermediate results, in a modular way. In a 20-person user study, we found that Chaining not only improved the quality of task outcomes, but also significantly enhanced system transparency, controllability, and sense of collaboration. Additionally, we saw that users developed new ways of interacting with LLMs through Chains: they leveraged sub-tasks to calibrate model expectations, compared and contrasted alternative strategies by observing parallel downstream effects, and debugged unexpected model outputs by “unit-testing” sub-components of a Chain. In two case studies, we further explore how LLM Chains may be used in future applications.",

        "abstract": "Misalignment between natural light rhythm and modern life activities induces disruption of the circadian rhythm. It is mainly evident that light at night (LAN) interferes with the human endocrine system and contributes to the increasing rates of obesity and lipid metabolic disease. Maintaining hepatointestinal circadian homeostasis is vital for improving lipid homeostasis. Melatonin is a chronobiotic substance that plays a main role in stabilizing bodily rhythm and has shown beneficial effects in protecting against obesity. Based on the dual effect of circadian rhythm regulation and antiobesity, we tested the effect of melatonin in mice under constant light exposure. Exposure to 24-h constant light (LL) increased weight and insulin resistance compared with those of the control group (12-h light–12-h dark cycle, LD), and simultaneous supplementation in the melatonin group (LLM) ameliorated this phenotype. Constant light exposure disturbed the expression pattern of a series of transcripts, including lipid metabolism, circadian regulation and nuclear receptors in the liver. Melatonin also showed beneficial effects in improving lipid metabolism and circadian rhythm homeostasis. Furthermore, the LL group had increased absorption and digestion of lipids in the intestine as evidenced by the elevated influx of lipids in the duodenum and decrease in the efflux of lipids in the jejunum. More interestingly, melatonin ameliorated the gut microbiota dysbiosis and improved lipid efflux from the intestine. Thus, these findings offer a novel clue regarding the obesity-promoting effect attributed to LAN and suggest a possibility for obesity therapy by melatonin in which melatonin could ameliorate rhythm disorder and intestinal dysbiosis.",

        "abstract": "While pre-trained large language models (LLM) like BERT have achieved state-of-the-art in several NLP tasks, their performance on tasks with additional grounding e.g. with numeric and categorical features is less studied. In this paper, we study the application of pre-trained LLM for Click-through-rate (CTR) prediction for product advertisement in e-commerce. This is challenging because the model needs to a) learn from language as well as tabular data features, b) maintain low-latency (<5 ms) at inference time, and c) adapt to constantly changing advertisement distribution. We ﬁrst show that scaling the pre-trained language model to 1.5 billion parameters signiﬁcantly improves performance over conventional CTR baselines. We then present CTR-BERT, a novel lightweight cache-friendly factorized model for CTR prediction that consists of twin-structured BERT-like encoders for text with a mechanism for late fusion for text and tabular features. We train the CTR-BERT model using cross-architecture knowledge distillation (KD) and empirically study the interaction between KD and distribution shift in this setting, by a) experimenting with pre-training, distillation pre-ﬁnetuning and ﬁne-tuning strategies b) factorizing features based on their distribution shift time scales, that allows the model to readily adapt and be re-trained. Finally, we show that CTR-BERT signiﬁcantly outperforms a traditional CTR baseline with a 2.3% relative ROC-AUC lift in ofﬂine experiments and a 2% CTR lift in an online experiment.",

        "abstract": "Log-layer mismatch refers to a chronic problem found in wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) or detached-eddy simulation, where the modeled wall-shear stress deviates from the true one by approximately 15%. Many efforts have been made to resolve this mismatch. The often-usedfixes, which are generally ad hoc, include modifying subgridscale stress models, adding a stochastic forcing, and moving the LES-wall-model matching location away from the wall. An analysis motivated by the integral wall-model formalism suggests that log-layer mismatch is resolved by the built-in physics-based temporal filtering. In this work we investigate in detail the effects of local filtering on log-layer mismatch. We show that both local temporal filtering and local wall-parallel filtering resolve log-layer mismatch without moving the LES-wall-model matching location away from the wall. Additionally, we look into the momentum balance in the near-wall region to provide an alternative explanation of how LLM occurs, which does not necessarily rely on the numerical-error argument. While filtering resolves log-layer mismatch, the quality of the wall-shear stress fluctuations predicted by WMLES does not improve with our remedy. The wall-shear stress fluctuations are highly underpredicted due to the implied use of LES filtering. However, good agreement can be found when the WMLES data are compared to the direct numerical simulation data filtered at the corresponding WMLES resolutions.",

        "abstract": "Automatic classification and segmentation of wireless capsule endoscope (WCE) images are two clinically significant and relevant tasks in a computer-aided diagnosis system for gastrointestinal diseases. Most of existing approaches, however, considered these two tasks individually and ignored their complementary information, leading to limited performance. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a deep synergistic interaction network (DSI-Net) for joint classification and segmentation with WCE images, which mainly consists of the classification branch (C-Branch), the coarse segmentation (CS-Branch) and the fine segmentation branches (FS-Branch). In order to facilitate the classification task with the segmentation knowledge, a lesion location mining (LLM) module is devised in C-Branch to accurately highlight lesion regions through mining neglected lesion areas and erasing misclassified background areas. To assist the segmentation task with the classification prior, we propose a category-guided feature generation (CFG) module in FS-Branch to improve pixel representation by leveraging the category prototypes of C-Branch to obtain the category-aware features. In such way, these modules enable the deep synergistic interaction between these two tasks. In addition, we introduce a task interaction loss to enhance the mutual supervision between the classification and segmentation tasks and guarantee the consistency of their predictions. Relying on the proposed deep synergistic interaction mechanism, DSI-Net achieves superior classification and segmentation performance on public dataset in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

        "abstract": "Recent work (e.g. LAMA (Petroni et al., 2019)) has found that the quality of the factual information extracted from Large Language Models (LLMs) depends on the prompts used to query them. This inconsistency is problematic because different users will query LLMs for the same information using different wording, but should receive the same, accurate responses regardless. In this work we aim to address this shortcoming by introducing P-Adapters: lightweight models that sit between the embedding layer and first attention layer of LLMs. They take LLM embeddings as input and output continuous prompts that are used to query the LLM. Additionally, we investigate Mixture of Experts (MoE) models that learn a set of continuous prompts (\"experts\") and select one to query the LLM. They require a separate classifier trained on human-annotated data to map natural language prompts to the continuous ones. P-Adapters perform comparably to the more complex MoE models in extracting factual information from BERT and RoBERTa while eliminating the need for additional annotations. P-Adapters show between 12-26% absolute improvement in precision and 36-50% absolute improvement in consistency over a baseline of only using natural language queries. Finally, we investigate what makes P-Adapters successful and conclude that a significant factor is access to the LLM's embeddings of the original natural language prompt, particularly the subject of the entity pair being queried.",

        "abstract": "Background\nThe Foundation for the NIH Sarcopenia Project validated cutpoints for appendicular lean mass. We ascertained the relationship between low lean mass (LLM), obesity, and mortality and identified predictors in this subgroup.\n\n\nMethods\nA total of 4,984 subjects aged 60 years and older were identified from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 linked to the National Death Index. LLM was defined using reduced appendicular lean mass (men < 19.75 kg; females < 15.02 kg). Obesity was defined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry body fat (males ≥ 25%; females ≥ 35%). LLM with obesity was defined using criteria for both LLM and obesity. Proportional hazard models determined mortality risk for LLM and LLM with obesity, separately (referent = no LLM and no LLM with obesity, respectively).\n\n\nResults\nMean age was 71.1 ± 0.19 years (56.5% female). Median follow-up was 102 months (interquartile range: 78, 124) with 1,901 deaths (35.0%). Prevalence of LLM with obesity was 33.5% in females and 12.6% in males. In those with LLM, overall mortality risk was 1.49 (1.27, 1.73) in males and 1.19 (1.02, 1.40) in females. Mortality risk in LLM with obesity was 1.31 (1.11, 1.55) and 0.99 (0.85, 1.16) in males and females, respectively. Age, diabetes, history of stroke, congestive heart failure, cancer, and kidney disease were predictive of death.\n\n\nConclusions\nRisk of death is higher in subjects with LLM than with LLM and obesity. Having advanced age, diabetes, stroke, heart failure, cancer, and renal disease predict a worse prognosis in both classifications.",

According to our estimates, starting with a ten per cent higher share of college-educated residents was associated with a higher growth in employment in the 0.5-2.2 per cent range. These results hold when considering both the municipal and the local labour market (LLM) levels, and they are robust to a wide set of urban characteristics. Our findings are confirmed using a measure of education dating back to 1931 as an instrument for human capital. Furthermore, we exploit a spatial localization model with human capital premiums to disentangle the estimated effect into two components related to productivity and life quality respectively. We find that productivity contributed to more than 60 per cent of the effect of human capital on urban growth at municipal level, and to over 90 per cent at the wider LLM level.",

This paper aims to unwrap the black box of deep ReLU networks through local linear representation, which utilizes the activation pattern and disentangles the complex network into an equivalent set of local linear models (LLMs). We develop a convenient LLM-based toolkit for interpretability, diagnostics, and simplification of a pre-trained deep ReLU network. We propose the local linear profile plot and other visualization methods for interpretation and diagnostics, and an effective merging strategy for network simplification.

        "abstract": "As one of the most influential international large-scale educational assessments, the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) provides a valuable platform for the horizontal comparisons and references of international education. The cognitive diagnostic model, a newly generated evaluation theory, can integrate measurement goals into the cognitive process model through cognitive analysis, which provides a better understanding of the mastery of students of fine-grained knowledge points. On the basis of the mathematical measurement framework of PISA 2012, 11 attributes have been formed from three dimensions in this study. Twelve test items with item responses from 24,512 students from 10 countries participated in answering were selected, and the analyses were divided into several steps. First, the relationships between the 11 attributes and the 12 test items were classified to form a Q matrix. Second, the cognitive model of the PISA mathematics test was established. The liner logistic model (LLM) with better model fit was selected as the parameter evaluation model through model comparisons. By analyzing the knowledge states of these countries and the prerequisite relations among the attributes, this study explored the different learning trajectories of students in the content field. The result showed that students from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Russia shared similar main learning trajectories, while Finland and Japan were consistent with their main learning trajectories. The primary learning trajectories of the United States and China were the same. Furthermore, the learning trajectory for Singapore was the most complicated, as it showed a diverse learning process, whereas the trajectory in the United States and Saudi Arabia was relatively simple. This study concluded the differences of the mastery of students of the 11 cognitive attributes from the three dimensions of content, process, and context across the 10 countries, which provided a reference for further understanding of the PISA test results in other countries and shed some evidence for a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of mathematics education in various countries.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Liebig’s law of the minimum (LLM) is often used to interpret empirical biological growth data and model multiple substrates co‐limited growth. However, its mechanistic foundation is rarely discussed, even though its validity has been questioned since its introduction in the 1820s. Here we first show that LLM is a crude approximation of the law of mass action, the state of art theory of biochemical reactions, and the LLM model is less accurate than two other approximations of the law of mass action: the synthesizing unit model and the additive model. We corroborate this conclusion using empirical data sets of algae and plants grown under two co‐limiting substrates. Based on our analysis, we show that when growth is modeled directly as a function of substrate uptake, the LLM model improperly restricts the organism to be of fixed elemental stoichiometry, making it incapable of consistently resolving biological adaptation, ecological evolution, and community assembly. When growth is modeled as a function of the cellular nutrient quota, the LLM model may obtain good results at the risk of incorrect model parameters as compared to those inferred from the more accurate synthesizing unit model. However, biogeochemical models that implement these three formulations are needed to evaluate which formulation is acceptably accurate and their impacts on predicted long‐term ecosystem dynamics. In particular, studies are needed that explore the extent to which parameter calibration can rescue model performance when the mechanistic representation of a biogeochemical process is known to be deficient.",

Herein, the aqueous solubility and oral bioavailability of liquiritin was purposely enhanced via the preparation of the mixed micelles. Methods The liquiritin-loaded micelles (LLM) were fabricated via thin-film dispersion method. The optimal LLM formulation was evaluated through physical properties including particle size (PS), encapsulation efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL). In vitro accumulate release as well as in vivo pharmacokinetics were also evaluated. Moreover, the hypolipidemic activity of LLM was observed in the hyperlipidemia mice model. Results The LLM exhibited a homogenous spherical shape with small mean PS, good stability and high encapsulation efficiency. The accumulate release rates in vitro of the LLM were obviously higher than free liquiritin. The oral bioavailability of the formulation was heightened by 3.98 times in comparison with the free liquiritin. More importantly, LLM increased the hypolipidemic and effect of alleviating lipid metabolism disorder in hepatocytes of liquiritin in hyperlipidemia mice model. Conclusions Collectively, the improved solubility of liquiritin in water coupled with its enhanced oral bioavailability and concomitant hypolipidemic activity could be attributed to the incorporation of the drug into the mixed micelles.",

We enrolled 959 men with an average age of 52.08 ± 7.91 years and performed weighted multiple regression analysis to determine the independent relationship between exposure variables (LLM, alternate LLM) and outcomes variables (urinary hesitancy, incomplete emptying, urinary frequency, nocturia, daytime LUTS, clinical LUTS) after adjusting for confounding factors. The prevalence of urinary hesitancy (OR = 7.76, P < 0.0001), incomplete emptying (OR = 2.49, P = 0.0070), urinary frequency (OR = 3.28, P < 0.0001), daytime LUTS (OR = 3.88, P < 0.0001) and clinical LUTS (OR = 8.11, P < 0.0001) was significantly higher among men with LLM compared to men without LLM. Moreover, alternate LLM (ALLM) was positively associated with urinary hesitancy (OR = 17.97, P < 0.0001), incomplete emptying (OR = 4.68, P = 0.0003), daytime LUTS (OR = 2.47, P = 0.0136) and clinical LUTS (OR = 12.18, P < 0.0001). These findings demonstrate that both LLM and ALLM were associated with a higher risk of LUTS in men aged ≥ 40 years, which suggested that early management and treatment of lean mass loss may improve or alleviate LUTS.",

A novel temperature demodulation method to improve the temperature measurement accuracy of the RDTS systems is presented. This method is based on the optical dynamic difference compensation algorithm, which can eliminate the optical power fluctuation. In addition, the visual localization technology is presented by using the longitudinal lining model (LLM) of a three-dimensional (3D) temperature display, which enhances the engineering application of RDTS in tunnel fire detection. Experimental results indicate that the temperature measurement accuracy is optimized from 7.0 °C to 1.9 °C at the sensing distance of 18.27 km by using the presented method. We provide a solution for temperature field monitoring as well as fire visual localization of the tunnel through RDTS systems.",

        "abstract": "A novel strategy to prepare spherical crystals of 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) has been developed by introducing polymeric additives into the antisolvent emulsion crystallization. The spherical crystals are induced by modifying the intermolecular hydrogen bonds network of LLM-105. The results show that the concentration of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which acts as a polymeric additive, is a crucial factor to get quite different morphologies of LLM-105 crystal products. X-like shaped crystals have been produced in the absence of PVP. In contrast, spherical crystals have been obtained in the presence of PVP. Importantly, LLM-105 spherulites with a mean particle size of 78.0 μm can be obtained by adding a proper amount of PVP, which has a narrow size distribution (CV = 31.2). In addition, time-resolved morphological evolution processes of X-like shaped and spherical crystals have been performed.

In this regard, EV demand is developed under four different scenarios, namely, uncoordinated charging model (UCM), load leveling model (LLM), maximum renewable model (MRM), and charging discharging model (CDM). A comprehensive study is performed to see the effect of these different EV charging/discharging behaviors in optimizing MG's operation. A 2m scheme of Hong's point estimate method (PEM) is applied to examine the effect of uncertainties linked with the forecasted errors in load demand, solar energy, wind energy, and grid price respectively on MG operation problem. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate the effect of variations in battery parameters on economics of remote MG.

        "abstract": "2,6-Diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) was first synthesized about 20 years ago and is regarded as a representative of the new generation of low-sensitivity energetic materials (EMs). Nevertheless, its thermal decay detail still remains lacking; in particular, the atomistic details of the decomposition of its condensed phase are absent. Thus, this work presents a quantum chemistry based study to reveal the details. Four pathways are found to initiate the primary molecular fission, including the intramolecular H transfer from a NH2 group to its neighboring acyl O atom, the NO2 partition, the acyl O partition, and the O partition from a NO2 group. The dominance of these pathways is strongly temperature-dependent, i.e., the intramolecular H transfer and the NO2 partition govern the initial steps at relatively low and high temperatures, respectively, and both the O partitions each occur once only at high temperature. Furthermore, we find that the intramolecular H transfer takes place always with a ...",

It also explores how tasks with varying interactional intensity in relation to the interaction loads influence the alignment magnitude and vocabulary learning outcomes. To this end, two studies were conducted. In Study 1, three groups of L2 learners were instructed to learn and use the target words while performing paraphrase, summary or continuation task. The results indicated that task-induced interactional intensity had robust effects on alignment magnitude as well as receptive and productive lexical knowledge. In Study 2, three groups of L2 learners were asked to complete a continuation task while interacting with high-proficiency peers (HL group), low-proficiency peers (LL group) or with both low-proficiency peers & video (LLM group). The results showed that interacting with high-proficiency partners had positive impact on alignment magnitude and lexical knowledge, but video exerted only a limited effect. The findings afforded evidence for the ‘interaction–alignment–learning’ research route and accounted for vocabulary acquisition from a new perspective.",

The level of ACE2 in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies collected in previous studies from 170 men (age: 19–65 years, weight: 56–137 kg, BMI: 23–44) and 69 women (age: 18–55 years, weight: 41–126 kg, BMI: 22–39) was analyzed in duplicate by western blot. VO2max was determined by ergospirometry and body composition by DXA. ACE2 protein expression was 1.8‐fold higher in women than men (p = 0.001, n = 239). This sex difference disappeared after accounting for the percentage of body fat (fat %), VO2max per kg of legs lean mass (VO2max‐LLM) and age (p = 0.47). Multiple regression analysis showed that the fat % (β = 0.47) is the main predictor of the variability in ACE2 protein expression in skeletal muscle, explaining 5.2% of the variance. VO2max‐LLM had also predictive value (β = 0.09). There was a significant fat % by VO2max‐LLM interaction, such that for subjects with low fat %, VO2max‐LLM was positively associated with ACE2 expression while as fat % increased the slope of the positive association between VO2max‐LLM and ACE2 was reduced. In conclusion, women express higher amounts of ACE2 in their skeletal muscles than men. This sexual dimorphism is mainly explained by sex differences in fat % and cardiorespiratory fitness. The percentage of body fat is the main predictor of the variability in ACE2 protein expression in human skeletal muscle.",

        "abstract": "Medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have been widely applied in nutritional supplementation. However, when administered individually or mixed, they were unable to maximize their nutritional value. Hence, EPA-rich medium- and long-chain triacylglycerol (MLCT) was synthesized from MCT and EPA-rich fish oil (FO) by enzymatic transesterification. The fatty acids in triglyceride (TAG) were rearranged which resulted in significant changes in TAG profiles compared to the physical mixture of MCT and FO (PM). EPA-containing MML (MML, MLM and LMM) and LLM (LLM, LML and MLL) type TAGs account for 70.21%. The fate of different oils (MCT, FO, PM, and MLCT) across the gastrointestinal tract was subsequently simulated using an in vitro digestion model. The results showed that the physical and structural characteristics of different oils during digestion depended upon the oil type and the microenvironment they were in. After 120 min of small intestine digestion, the degree of hydrolysis for MLCT was higher than that for the other three oils. The final FFA release level was in the following order: MLCT (102.79%) > MCT (95.20%) > PM (85.81%) > FO (74.18%). This can be attributed to the composition and positional distribution of fatty acids in TAGs. What's more, LCFAs (EPA) in MLCT mainly existed in the form of sn-2 MAG, which was conducive to their subsequent absorption and transport. These results may aid in the future rational design of structural lipids, thereby regulating lipid digestion and maximizing the nutritional value of oils.",

The lack of a full understanding of second language (L2) listening subskills made model selection difficult. In search of optimal CDM(s) that could provide a better understanding of L2 listening subskills and facilitate accurate classification, this study carried a two-layer model selection. At the test level, A-CDM, LLM, and R-RUM had an acceptable and comparable model fit, suggesting mixed inter-attribute relationships of L2 listening subskills. At the item level, Mixed-CDMs were selected and confirmed the existence of mixed relationships. Mixed-CDMs had better model and person fit than G-DNIA. In addition to statistical approaches, the content analysis provided theoretical evidence to confirm and amend the item-level CDMs. It was found that semantic completeness pertaining to the attributes and item features may influence the attribute relationships. Inexplicable attribute conflicts could be a signal of suboptimal model choice. Sample size and the number of multi-attribute items should be taken into account in L2 listening cognitive diagnostic modeling studies. This study provides useful insights into the model selection and the underlying cognitive process for L2 listening tests.",

In this study, two novel fused-ring energetic compounds, namely 3,6-dinitropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-5,7-diamine (4) and 5-amino-3,6-dinitropyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7(4H)-one (5), were successfully prepared via a simple synthetic method. In addition, their structure, thermal stability, mechanical sensitivity and detonation performance were fully explored. Noteworthily, compounds 4 and 5 both exhibit excellent thermal stability (TD(4) = 325 °C and TD(5) = 291 °C), particularly compound 4, which features an “amino–nitro–amino” arrangement similar to that of TATB and exhibits a high density of 1.88 g cm−3 and a greater thermal decomposition temperature than hexanitrostilbene (HNS, 316 °C). In addition, due to the aza-fused structure, 4 and 5 possess higher positive heats of formation (332.9 kJ mol−1 and 181.4 kJ mol−1) than LLM-105 (11.0 kJ mol−1). These advanced features endow 4 and 5 with superior detonation performance (Vd(4) = 8338 m s−1 and P(4) = 30.7 GPa; Vd(5) = 8097 m s−1 and P(5) = 29.8 GPa) than TATB (Vd = 8179 m s−1 and P = 30.5 GPa) and HNS (Vd = 7170 m s−1 and P = 21.8 GPa).

However, reducing potentially preventable ICU stays may be an alternative to ensure adequate capacity.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo determine the proportions of ICU admissions meeting two definitions of being potentially preventable using nationally representative United States (US) claims databases.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe analyzed claims from 2006 to 2015 from all Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) beneficiaries and from a large national payer offering a private plan (PI) and a Medicare Advantage (MA) plan. Potentially preventable hospitalizations were identified using existing definitions for ambulatory care sensitive conditions (ACSC) and life-limiting malignancies (LLM).\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe analyzed 420,369,434 person-years of insurance coverage during which there were 99,793,416 acute inpatient hospitalizations, of which 16,646,977 (16.7%) were associated with an ICU admission. Of these, the proportions with an ACSC were 12.9%, 12.7%, and 15.8%, and with a LLM were 5.2%, 5.4%, and 6.4%, among those with PI, MA, and FFS, respectively. Over 10 years, the absolute percentages of ACSC-associated ICU stays declined (PI -1.1%, MA -6.4%, FFS -6.4%; all P<0.001 for all trends). Smaller changes were noted among LLM-associated ICU stays, declining in the MA cohort (-0.8%) and increasing in the FFS (+0.3%) and PI (+0.2%) populations (P<0.001 for all trends).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAn appreciable proportion of US ICU admissions may be preventable with community-based interventions. Investment in the outpatient infrastructure required to prevent these ICU admissions should be considered as a complementary, if not alternative, strategy to expanding ICU capacity to meet future demand.",

        "abstract": "Dinitropyrazole is an important structure for the design and synthesis of energetic materials. In this work, we reported the first comparative thermal studies of two representative dinitropyrazole-based energetic materials, 4-amino-3,5-dinitropyrazole (LLM-116) and its novel trimer derivative (LLM-226). Both the experimental and theoretical results proved the active aromatic N-H moiety would cause incredible variations in the physicochemical characteristics of the obtained energetic materials. Thermal behaviors and kinetic studies of the two related dinitropyrazole-based energetic structures showed that impressive thermal stabilization could be achieved after the trimerization, but also would result in a less concentrated heat-release process. Detailed analysis of condensed-phase systems and the gaseous products during the thermal decomposition processes, and simulation studies based on ReaxFF force field, indicated that the ring opening of LLM-116 was triggered by hydrogen transfer of the active aromatic N-H moiety. In contrast, the initial decomposition of LLM-226 was caused by the rupture of carbon-nitrogen bonds at the diazo moiety.",

        "title": "Combination of DXA and BIS Predicts Jump Power Better Than Traditional Measures of Sarcopenia",
        "abstract": "Traditional diagnostic criteria for sarcopenia use dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA)‐measured appendicular lean mass (ALM), normalized to height (ALM/ht2) or body mass index (ALM/BMI) to define low muscle mass. However, muscle function declines with aging before the loss of muscle mass is detected by ALM. This is likely due, in part, to qualitative muscle changes such as extracellular and intracellular fluid compartment shifts uncaptured by DXA. We propose combining bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), which estimates extracellular and intracellular compartment volume, with DXA to more accurately predict muscle function. This combination may help incorporate muscle quality, thereby improving sarcopenia diagnosis. We cross‐sectionally analyzed data from 248 Black and White participants aged 25 to 75 years from the Midlife in the United States Refresher Cohort. We proposed two novel muscle measures: ALM corrected by the BIS‐derived whole‐body extracellular to intracellular fluid ratio (E/I) and leg lean mass (LLM) corrected by leg‐specific E/I, creating (ALM/(E/I)W) and (LLM/(E/I)L), respectively. We compared the associations of traditional muscle measures, ALM/(E/I)W, and LLM/(E/I)L, with grip strength and lower limb power using jumping mechanography. LLM/(E/I)L explained jump power best at R2 = 0.803 compared with ALM/(E/I)W (p < 0.0001) and all other measures. ALM/(E/I)W explained jump power second best (R2 = 0.759) but not significantly better than traditional muscle measures. No muscle measure performed better than covariates when predicting handgrip strength. LLM/(E/I)L outperformed ALM/ht2 and ALM/BMI when predicting jump power. We propose LLM/(E/I)L is a powerful and clinically relevant method that accounts for muscle quality. © 2021 The Authors.

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide with critical consequences in health, as well as in social, economic, and particularly in psychological conditions of vulnerable people, especially older adults. Therefore, it is necessary the direct attention to their health care needs and related interventions. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) have direct impact on older adults’ health and quality of life leading to decreased depression and loneliness, along with empowerment of independent life. Many studies involve cognitive training programs/software based on new technological systems that provide to vulnerable people access to gamified, attractive, cognitive exercises for overall functionality everywhere and at any time. Twenty-four participants (mean age 69.3 years) were assigned to this study. The cognitive training component of LLM Care was used as an interactive software to enhance participants’ cognitive functions. The intervention lasted 12 weeks with the frequency of 2–4 times per week in sessions of at least 30 min. Participants used their personal devices (tablets/laptops) in their own residence, while technical and consulting guidance was provided by LLM Care certified trainers. They were informed about the purpose of the study, while consent forms along with psychological assessments were distributed every 2 weeks to periodically evaluate their psychosocial and mental health conditions. The assessments included the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), the Short Anxiety Screening Test (SAST), the System Usability Scale (SUS) and the Impact Factor Event Scale (IES-R). According to the results, the participants with improved well-being tended to report decreased subjective distress caused by COVID-19, and their engagement with new technologies can potentially minimize the negative outcomes occurred by the current stressful situation, mitigating the effect of hyperarousal symptoms, while increasing their overall well-being. Well-being seems to remain relatively stable among older adults and decreases only when adversities occur, while the usability of the software was perceived as marginally acceptable by participants. The exploitation of the LLM Care contributes to the improvement of older adults’ well-being and alleviates the negative experience caused by stressful situations like COVID-19.",

In this work, we propose learnable loss mixup (LLM), a simple and effortless training diagram, to improve the generalization of deep learning-based speech enhancement models. Loss mixup, of which learnable loss mixup is a special variant, optimizes a mixture of the loss functions of random sample pairs to train a model on virtual training data constructed from these pairs of samples. In learnable loss mixup, by conditioning on the mixed data, the loss functions are mixed using a non-linear mixing function automatically learned via neural parameterization. Our experimental results on the VCTK benchmark show that learnable loss mixup achieves 3.26 PESQ, outperforming the state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "A focused, nanosecond-pulsed laser has been used to ablate, atomize, ionize, and excite milligram quantities of metal-doped energetic materials that undergo exothermic reactions in the laser-induced plasma. The subsequent shock wave expansion in the air above the sample has been monitored using high-speed schlieren imaging in a recently developed technique, laser-induced air shock from energetic materials (LASEM). The method enables the estimation of detonation velocities based on the measured laser-induced air-shock velocities and has previously been demonstrated for organic military explosives. Here, the LASEM technique has been extended to explosive formulations with metal additives. A comparison of the measured laser-induced air-shock velocities for TNT, RDX, DNTF, and LLM-172 doped with Al or B to the detonation velocities predicted by the thermochemical code CHEETAH for inert or active metal participation demonstrates that LASEM has potential for predicting the early time (<10  μs) participation of metal additives in detonation events. The LASEM results show that while Al is mostly inert at early times in the detonation event (confirmed from large-scale detonation testing), B is active-and reducing the amount of hydrogen present during the early chemical reactions increases the resulting estimated detonation velocities.",

        "abstract": "Lead-based liquid metals (LLMs) such as lead–bismuth eutectic (LBE) and lead, are currently the most interesting candidate coolants for fast reactors because of their excellent physical properties, which can improve safety and reduce costs. However, in comparison to other liquid metals, previous research on the flow and heat-transfer characteristics of LLMs has been limited. Therefore, this work carried out flow and heat-transfer experiments in LBE flowing through a circular tube in the Natural Circulation Capability Loop (NCCL) facility. The results show a significantly higher friction factor than that of water flowing in a smooth pipe. Furthermore, the Nusselt numbers were found to be lower than those found in data in the literature for experiments carried out in a smooth tube at low Péclet numbers, while they were higher at high Péclet numbers. Therefore, theoretical analyses were performed for LLMs flowing in both smooth and rough pipes, and the impacts of roughness on the heat transfer of an LLM were examined. The theoretical relations for a smooth pipe and a rough pipe were validated using experimental data from the literature and the results of the NCCL experiments, respectively. The results of the theoretical relation for a smooth pipe fitted the literature data well. The derived theoretical relation for a rough pipe with a relative roughness of 0.004 fitted the NCCL data best. Moreover, it was established from the theoretical analysis that roughness has two competitive impacts on the heat transfer of an LLM: it reduces conductive heat transfer while enhancing convective heat transfer. Because conductive heat transfer is important for liquid metals, even with turbulent flow, a small roughness will lead to heat-transfer deterioration at low Péclet numbers, and it may even deteriorate across the whole typical Péclet-number range. This discovery has important implications for the thermal–hydraulic design of LLM reactors, because corrosion and erosion by an LLM will lead to a rough surface after long operating times.",

We hypothesised that LLMZ correlates with indexed systemic flow (Qsi) and cardiac index (CI) on exercise cardiac magnetic resonance (eCMR). Methods Thirteen patients had LLM measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry within mean 40 (range 0–258) days of eCMR. LLM was converted to sex and race-specific Z-scores based on healthy reference data. Ventricular volumes and flow measurements of the ascending and descending (DAO) aorta and superior vena cava (SVC) were obtained by CMR at rest and just after supine ergometer exercise to a heart rate associated with anaerobic threshold on prior exercise test. Baseline and peak exercise measures of Qsi (SVC+DAO/BSA) and CI, as well as change in Qsi and CI with exercise, were compared with LLMZ by linear regression. Results LLMZ was not correlated with resting flows, stroke volume or CI. There was a strong linear correlation between LLMZ and change in both CI (r=0.77, p=0.002) and Qsi (r=0.73, p=0.005) from rest to exercise. There was also a significant correlation between LLMZ and Qsi at exercise (r=0.70, p=0.008). The correlation between LLMZ and CI at exercise did not reach significance (r=0.3, p=0.07). Conclusions In our cohort, there was a strong linear correlation between LLMZ and change in both CI and Qsi from rest to exercise, suggesting that Fontan patients with higher LLMZ may be better able to augment systemic output during exercise, improving performance.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Models of education delivering content teaching through learners’ second language have rapidly increased in recent decades and are thought to offer a ‘naturally’ motivating context for learners to use and learn the medium of instruction (MoI). However, the relationship between MoI and language learning motivation (LLM) specifically is under-explored. In light of calls for contextually responsive theorizations of LLM, this study examines interactions between English language learning motivation (ELLM) and micro (MoI classrooms) and macro (schools) contexts in Hong Kong. ELLM measures were administered to Hong Kong secondary school learners of English (N = 3854), aged 11–14, studying in English, Chinese and Mixed mode of instruction schools. ANOVA results indicate higher levels of ELLM among EMI students on most measures and effects of MoI on three LLM constructs. The results support the relevance of a required orientation in explaining participants’ ELLM and challenge the applicability of the ideal L2 self, which may be attributable to context rather than cultural difference. Implications are discussed for existing understandings of the MoI-LLM relationship, as well as discussions around culturally relevant theorizations of LLM.",

We evaluated the role of microaspiration in the pathogenesis of reflux-related cough by determining the amount of lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. Methods A total of 161 cases of chronic cough were evaluated, and 36 patients (average age 48.2 years) were recruited for this single center prospective study. Patients with a history of smoking, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor usage, any abnormality on pulmonary function tests, abnormal chest X-rays, occupational or environmental exposures, or upper airway cough syndrome were excluded. GERD was evaluated by 24-hour esophageal impedance-pH monitoring. BAL specimens for LLM determination were obtained from 34 patients by flexible bronchoscopy. Results Patients with pathological intra-esophageal reflux according to multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring had higher LLM positivity in BAL specimens than patients without pathological reflux (8/14 in reflux positive group vs 1/22 in reflux negative group; P = 0.004). The BAL cell distribution was not different between the 2 groups (P = 0.574 for macrophages, P = 0.348 for lymphocytes, P = 0.873 for neutrophils and P = 0.450 for eosinophils). Conclusions Our results confirm the role of the microaspiration of refluxate in the pathogenetic mechanism of chronic cough. While bronchoscopy is indicated in patients with chronic cough, in addition to the routine airway evaluation, BAL and LLM detection should be performed. LLM can be used to diagnose aspiration in reflux-related chronic cough. Future studies are needed to evaluate the response to anti-reflux medications or surgery in patients with LLM positivity.",

        "abstract": "Populations residing near species' low‐latitude range margins (LLMs) often occur in warmer and drier environments than those in the core range. Thus, their genetic composition could be shaped by climatic drivers that differ from those occurring at higher latitudes, resulting in potentially adaptive variants of conservation value. Such variants could facilitate the adaptation of populations from other portions of the geographical range to similar future conditions anticipated under ongoing climate change. However, very few studies have assessed standing genetic variation at potentially adaptive loci in natural LLM populations. We investigated standing genetic variation at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 117 candidate genes and its links to putative climatic selection pressures across 19 pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) populations distributed along a regional climatic gradient near the species' southern range margin in southeastern Europe. These populations are restricted to floodplain forests along large lowland rivers, whose hydric regime is undergoing significant shifts under modern rapid climate change. The populations showed very weak geographical structure, suggesting extensive genetic connectivity and gene flow or shared ancestry. We identified eight (6.2%) positive FST‐outlier loci, and genotype–environment association analyses revealed consistent associations between SNP allele frequencies and several climatic variables linked to water availability. A total of 61 associations involving 37 SNPs (28.5%) from 35 annotated genes provided important insights into putative functional mechanisms in our system. Our findings provide empirical support for the role of LLM populations as sources of potentially adaptive variation that could enhance species’ resilience to climate change‐related pressures.",

Materials and Methods: Adults with a first known total cholesterol of mean (95% CI) 9.8 mmol/L (9.5, 10.1) were included consecutively in their routine consultation during 2006. Of the patients 86.4% had a pathogenic FH-mutation and the remaining were clinically diagnosed. We included 357 patients and 279 met for follow-up after median 10.0 (min 8.1, max 12.8) years. Results: Mean (95% CI) low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) was reduced from 3.9 (3.8, 4.1) to 3.0 (2.9, 3.2). More men than women used high intensity statin treatment, 85.2 and 60.8%, respectively. Women (n = 129) had higher LDL-C; 3.3 mmol/L (3.0, 3.5), than men; (n = 144) 2.8 mmol/L (2.6, 3.0), p = 0.004. Add-on PCSK9 inhibitors (n = 25) reduced mean LDL-C to 2.0 (1.4, 2.6) mmol/L. At enrollment 57 patients (20.4%) had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and 46 (80.4%) of them experienced a new event during the study period. Similarly, 222 (79.6%) patients had no detectable ASCVD at enrollment, and 29 of them (13.1%) experienced a first-time event during the study period. Conclusion: A mean LDL-C of 3.0 mmol/L was achievable in FH, treated intensively at a specialized clinic with few users of PCSK9 inhibitors. LDL-C was higher (0.5 mmol/L) in women than in men. In patients with ASCVD at enrollment, most (80.7%) experienced a new ASCVD event in the study period. The FH patients in primary prevention had more moderate CV risk, 13% in ten years.",

Real-world data of 93 BRAF V600E mCRC patients from Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were evaluated using the prognostic factors affecting overall survival (OS). Treatment of metastases served as an independent prognosticator, where curative locoregional interventions (LRIs) were associated with superior clinical outcomes (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22–0.98; p = 0.044). The LRIs group showed an improved median OS of 49.4 months versus 18.3 months for the palliative treatments (PTs) group. The median OS of patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) was significantly prolonged after undergoing LRIs (42.4 vs. 23.7 months; HR: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.01–1.22; p = 0.030), and patients in the LRIs plus liver-limited or lung-limited metastasis (LLM) group benefited more than those in the LRIs plus non-LLM group when compared to the PTs group (LLM from LRIs vs. PTs, HR: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04–0.68; p = 0.006.

        "abstract": "Background Korean-Chinese (KC) women make up the largest group of female migrants in South Korea. To prevent and manage chronic diseases in middle-aged KC women working full time, it is necessary to develop health promotion programs that utilize an online platform because such a platform would allow individuals to participate in health promotion interventions at their convenience. Objective This study aimed to develop a living lab for a mobile-based health (LLm Health) program focused on improving the physical activity and cultural adaptation of KC women workers. Methods We used a mixed methods design. Living lab principles were factored into the LLm Health program, including the use of multiple methods, user engagement, multistakeholder participants, real-life settings, and cocreation. The program was developed using the 4 steps of the intervention mapping method: needs assessment, setting of objectives, identification of intervention strategies, and intervention design. Needs assessment was conducted through a literature review, focus group interviews with a total of 16 middle-aged KC women, and an online survey related to health promotion of migrant workers given to 38 stakeholders. KC middle-aged women participated in the early stages of program development and provided the idea of developing programs and mobile apps to enhance physical activity and acculturation. The mobile app developed in the program was validated with the help of 12 KC women and 4 experts, including 3 nursing professors and a professor of physical education. They were asked to rate each item based on content, interface design, and technology on a 4-point scale using a 23-item Smartphone App Evaluation Tool for Health Care. Results The LLm Health program comprised a 24-week walking program using Fitbit devices, the mobile app, and social cognitive interventions. The mobile app contained 6 components: a step counter, an exercise timer, an online chat function, health information, level of cardiovascular risk, and health status. The cultural aspects and lifestyles of KC women were accommodated in the entire process of program development. The content validity of the mobile app was found to be 0.90 and 0.96 according to the 12 KC women and 4 experts, respectively. Conclusions The mobile app was found to be valid and acceptable for KC women. The living lab approach was a useful strategy for developing a culturally adaptive LLm Health program for KC women workers, leading to their active participation in the overall research process, including needs assessment, program composition, and pre-evaluation.",

Community pharmacists are ideally positioned to detect non-adherence and to provide patient-centred interventions.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo conduct a systematic review of the impact of community pharmacist interventions on patient adherence to lipid lowering medication (LLM) prescriptions and clinical outcomes.\n\n\nSEARCH METHOD\nFive databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge) were searched systematically to identify relevant reports published by December 2019. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB 2.0) tool.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nControlled trials in which community pharmacists conducted an intervention to improve patient adherence to LLM and clinical outcomes were evaluated.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nFive studies (2408 participants) were included in the qualitative analysis. Four studies (n = 2266) were pooled in the meta-analysis. Participants in the intervention group (IG) had better adherence than those in the control group (CG) [odds ratio (OR) = 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.38-2.02; P < 0.001; I2 = 54%]. Better adherence rates were obtained when adherence was measured with validated questionnaires than when medication-possession ratio (MPR) measurements were used. Total cholesterol (TC) levels were not included in the meta-analysis due to data variability among the studies.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPharmacist-led intervention can improve LLM adherence, but its influence on clinical outcomes, including lipid level control, remains to be clarified.",

        "abstract": "Modern engine research uses multi-dimensional Mathematical Models (MMs) that are applicable to multi-fuel engines. However, their use involves the availability of detailed technical data on the design and characteristics of the engine, which is not always possible. The use of a one-dimensional MM is more expedient for the prediction of engine parameters, but their application for this purpose has not yet been sufficiently investigated. This publication presents the results of numerical studies evaluating the application of a one-dimensional MM with bi-phase Vibe combustion laws for dual-fuel (DF) Diesel (D) and Natural Gas (NG) engine power parameters. The motor test results of a high-speed 4ČN79.5/95.5 Diesel Engine (DE) with a conventional fuel injection system were used as adequacy criteria. The engines were operated with D100 and DF D20/NG80, in high(HLM), medium(MLM), and low(LLM) load modes, and the angle of Diesel-fuel Injection Timing (DIT) was changed from −1 to −13 °CA in the Before Top Dead Center (BTDC) range. Modelling of the single-phase Vibe combustion law has limited applicability for efficient use only in HLM (with an error of 7%). In the MLM and LLM regimes, owing to non-compliance with real bi-phasic combustion with a strongly extended NG diffusive second phase, the modelling error is 50%. Individual MM matching in MLM and LLM in a DF D20/ NG80 experiment detected a burn time increase from between 45 and 50 °CA, to 110 and 200 °CA, respectively. Limited use of the one-dimensional MM in the evaluation of DF engine performance has been identified. When comparing a onedimensional MM with experimental data, a bi-phase law of heat release characteristic should be considered for better coincidence. In addition, individual MM matching with an experiment on each engine load mode ensured acceptable accuracy in testing and optimising the parameters of the indicator process, including DIT.",

Their clinical outcomes before and after arthrocentesis and stabilization splint therapy were compared. Evaluation criteria were as follows: 1) Maximal mouth opening (MMO); 2) Right and left maximal lateral movement (RLM, LLM) and maximal protrusive movement (PM); 3) Visual analog scale (VAS) pain score during MMO, RLM, LLM, and PM; and 4) VAS pain score during palpation of masticatory muscles. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Mc Nemar test, and paired t-test were used for statistical analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDifferences in VAS pain score between arthrocentesis and non-arthrocentesis sites were not statistically significant except MMO and LLM (p < 0.05) after 6 months. Differences in mean VAS pain scores for all variables between before arthrocentesis and 6 months follow-up in the arthrocentesis site were statistically significant.

The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of LLM on cMyc, which is overexpressed in a subset of human prostate cancers.\n\n\nMethods\nThe effect of LLM on cMyc expression and activity was determined by western blotting/confocal microscopy and luciferase reporter assay, respectively. A transgenic mouse model of prostate cancer (Hi-Myc) was used to determine chemopreventive efficacy of LLM.\n\n\nResults\nExposure of androgen sensitive (LNCaP) and castration-resistant (22Rv1) human prostate cancer cells to LLM resulted in downregulation of protein and mRNA levels of cMyc. Overexpression of cMyc partially attenuated LLM-mediated inhibition of colony formation, cell viability, and cell migration in 22Rv1 and/or PC-3 cells. LLM treatment decreased protein levels of cMyc targets (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase), however, overexpression of cMyc did not attenuate these effects. A trend for a decrease in expression level of cMyc protein was discernible in 22Rv1 xenografts from LLM-treated mice compared with control mice. The LLM treatment (10 mg/kg body weight, 5 times/week) was well-tolerated by Hi-Myc transgenic mice. The incidence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, and microinvasion was lower in LLM-treated Hi-Myc mice but the difference was not statistically significant.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe present study reveals that LLM inhibits cMyc expression in human prostate cancer cells in vitro but concentrations higher than 10 mg/kg may be required to achieve chemoprevention of prostate cancer.",

Resistance training–induced gains in muscle strength and power mediate the improvement in walking speed in middle-aged women who are breast cancer survivors. J Strength Cond Res 38(4): 773–782, 2024—(a) Ascertain whether lower muscle mass, strength (1 repetition maximum [1RM]), and power (Pmax) in middle-aged women who are breast cancer survivors (BCS), when compared with women of a similar age never diagnosed with cancer (WNC), are related with lower walking speed (WS). (b) Ascertain whether changes in WS are associated with changes in muscle mass, 1RM, and (or) Pmax after resistance training (RT) in middle-aged BCS. A cross-section study was performed. Twenty WNC and 21 BCS were evaluated for lean mass of legs (LLM), 1RM (knee extension), muscle quality index (MQI = 1RM/LLM), Pmax (maximum muscle power–knee extension), and fast WS (10 and 400-meters). Randomized clinical trial was performed. The BCS were randomly divided into the control group (n = 9) and the RT group (n = 11). Breast cancer survivors exhibited lower 1RM (24.2%, p ˂ 0.001), Pmax (30.6%, p ˂ 0.001), MQI (22.2%, p = 0.001), and WS (10-m = 17.0%, p ˂ 0.001 and 400-m = 10.5%, p = 0.002) than WNC. Resistance training increased 1RM (31.6%, p = 0.001), MP (29.0%, p = 0.012), MQI (28.5%, p = 0.008), and WS (10-m = 9.4%, p = 0.009 and 400-m = 6.2%, p = 0.006) in BCS. The changes in WS were positively associated with 1RM (10-m = 68%, p = 0.001 and 400-m = 37%, p = 0.036) and Pmax (10-m = 56%, p = 0.005 and 400-m = 40%, p = 0.027) and MQI (10-m = 63%, p = 0.043 and 400-m = 37%, p = 0.035).

Results showed that LLM in broiler finisher diets resulted in significant (P<0.05) increase in feed intake relative to the control diet. The control diet and 50LLM kg diet supported similar (P>0.05) final body weight and weight gain, but these parameters were significantly (P<0.05) depressed in broilers fed 100gLLM/kg diet. Feed conversion ratio became poorer with increase in level of LLM. Carcass yield was not significantly influenced (P>0.05) by dietary treatments. Cut-up parts as a percentage of dressed weight showed that thigh and drumstick had a non-significant decrease in weight while back and wing had a non-significant increase in level of dietary LLM. Breast, neck and abdominal fat pad were significantly (P<0.05) decreased with increased LLM. Broilers fed 100gLLM/kg diet exhibited a significantly lower weight for liver, spleen, lung and heart in comparison with the control diet. Only the gizzard is significantly higher (P<0.05) in broilers fed LLM compared to the control diet (without LLM). It can be concluded that LLM inclusion at 100g/kg diet had a negative effect on performance but not on carcass parameters whereas LLM at 50g/kg diet gave comparable response with the control diet in all parameters measured.",

This is based on learnings from international best practices. It looks at the structure and policy apparatus of redress systems of financial regulators and the challenges consumers face while accessing them. Regulators differ in their approaches to grievance redress mechanisms, face conflicts of interest, and follow complicated processes. They also take too long to resolve grievances and do not have a defined point of closure. The regulations are often not accessible to consumers, and when they are, they are difficult to understand. This implies a need to simplify the procedure, better inform consumers, and include enforcement provisions to enable greater grievance redress. ∗Karan Gulati is a researcher at NIPFP and Karthik Suresh is an LLM Candidate at the University of Hamburg.

        "abstract": "Fifteen years ago, I was an LLM student at New York University School of Law, sitting in a large classroom for a course on law and development, which was taught by Frank Upham. I knew a bit about the economic miracle in Taiwan and elsewhere in East Asia. I was amazed at my JD classmates’ experience in undeveloped countries. I was also impressed with Upham’s language skills—other than English, he can speak Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and French very fluently. With an uncanny eye for real-world situations, language skills to do first-hand research, and a willingness to think differently, Upham guided students through the different development hurdles around the world. Looking back, I did not know at the time that I would become a property scholar, not to mention studying property law around the world. It is now a happy surprise that the Law and Social Inquiry invited me to review Upham’s (2018) book, The Great Property Fallacy, which, in a way, sums up his life-long thinking on law and development. Economic development of nations is a huge topic that attracts a wide range of different perspectives. Nobel laureate economists Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo in Good Economics for Hard Times (2019) and Poor Economics (2011) focus on economic factors such as the misallocation of resources and the usual macroeconomic factors like trade openness. Economist Daron Acemoglu and political scientist James Robinson (2012), in Why Nations Fail, focus on political institutions. New institutional economists, such as Ronald Coase (1988), Douglass North (1990), and Harold Demsetz (2008) (the first two are Nobel laureates and Demsetz deserves the prize, too, in my view), in a somewhat broader context, focus on both formal and informal institutions. Law and development scholars, instead, understandably are interested in the role of formal law in development.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT To determine the formation possibility of 2,6‐diamino‐3,5‐dinitropyrazine‐1‐oxide (LLM-105) /ammonium perchlorate (AP) mixed crystal, the dimer configuration of LLM-105/AP was screened. Three possible configurations (LLM-105/AP1, LLM-105/AP2, and LLM-105/AP3) were obtained, and the mixed crystal of LLM-105/AP and AP’/AP crystal were examined. The binding energy (Ebind), electrostatic potential (ESP), and electronic density topology (AIM) of the dimers of LLM-105/AP were evaluated. Then the radial distribution function (RDF) between nitrogen atoms and oxygen atoms specified in LLM-105/AP and the length distribution of trigger bonds was calculated. The results revealed the hydrogen bonds in those configurations of LLM-105/AP. The binding energy of the three configurations corresponded to 29.7363, 20.8283, and 19.2166 kcal·mol−1. The sequence of the electron density ρ(r) at the bond critical point (BCP) was LLM-105/AP1 > LLM-105/AP2 > LLM-105/AP3. The noticeable peaks were observed in LLM-105/AP and AP’/AP at 0.11–0.31 nm. The Lmax values in LLM-105/AP and AP’/AP were 0.1080 nm and 0.1086 nm, respectively. Therefore, it is possible for LLM-105 and AP to form a mixed crystal. The sensitivity of AP decreased with the addition of LLM-105. The zero oxygen balance could be reached at LLM-105: AP mass ratios between 50:50 and 40:60.",

        "abstract": "The active control of internal transport barriers (ITBs) is an important issue to achieve high performance plasma in a fusion reactor. A critical challenge of ITB control is to increase the ITB position. The ITBs with internal kink modes (IKMs), such as fishbone (FB) instability and long-live mode (LLM) with mode number of m/n = 1/1 are frequently observed on HL-2A tokamak in neutral beam heated discharges. The correlation of FB instability/LLM with ITBs is analyzed in order to extend the ITB radius. It has been revealed that FB instability and LLM are often excited after the ITB formation. Therefore, FB instability and LLM play no role in triggering ITBs on HL-2A tokamak. On the other hand, they may slow down the outward radial expansion and then shrink the foot position of ITB, and damp the gradient growth of ion temperature and rotation velocity. Since the perturbation of LLM is weaker than that of FB instability, the shrinking effect of ITB foot and braking effect on gradient growth are slighter than those of FB instability. Compared with the LLM, FB instability routinely appears in plasmas with lower density, higher heating power and lower plasma current. In addition, large ITBs without IKMs are also discussed on HL-2A tokamak. The large ITB is the largest one, the FB ITB is the strongest one and the LLM ITB is the widest one in three ITBs, where the ‘large’, ‘strong’ and ‘wide’ qualifications correspond to ITB position ρ ITB, the normalized temperature gradient R/LT, and its width W/a. Therefore, the large ITB position may be obtained if the IKMs are effectively controlled in a tokamak.",

        "abstract": "Increased de novo synthesis of fatty acids is implicated in the pathogenesis of human prostate cancer, but a safe and effective clinical inhibitor of this metabolic pathway is still lacking. We have shown previously that leelamine (LLM) suppresses transcriptional activity of androgen receptor, which is known to regulate fatty acid synthesis. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate the effect of LLM on fatty acid synthesis. Exposure of 22Rv1, LNCaP, and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, but not RWPE-1 normal prostate epithelial cell line, to LLM resulted in a decrease in intracellular levels of neutral lipids or total free fatty acids. LLM was superior to another fatty acid synthesis inhibitor (cerulenin) for suppression of total free fatty acid levels. LLM treatment downregulated protein and/or mRNA expression of key fatty acid synthesis enzymes, including ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, fatty acid synthase, and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) in each cell line. Consistent with these in vitro findings, we also observed a significant decrease in ATP citrate lyase and SREBP1 protein expression as well as number of neutral lipid droplets in vivo in 22Rv1 tumor sections of LLM-treated mice when compared with that of controls. LLM-mediated suppression of intracellular levels of total free fatty acids and neutral lipids was partly attenuated by overexpression of SREBP1. In conclusion, these results indicate that LLM is a novel inhibitor of SREBP1-regulated fatty acid/lipid synthesis in prostate cancer cells that is not affected by androgen receptor status.",

        "abstract": "One important consequence of the English reformation was the dissolution of the Canon Law Faculties at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, effectively ending the academic study of law and religion in the United Kingdom. This all changed in the last decades of the twentieth century. In 1991, the Ecclesiastical Law Society supported the establishment of a Master’s Degree in Canon Law at the University of Cardiff Law School, the first of its type since the Reformation. The LLM led to the introduction of an undergraduate module on Law and Religion within the traditional curriculum of the Law School, which examined the interaction between State law and religion. This module has now been replicated in the University of Manchester Law School and Lancaster University Law School, as well as other Law Schools in the country. This paper will critically reflect on the pedagogical challenges personally faced by the author whilst delivering the Law and Religion module in the modern and secular law school setting, including: interdisciplinary initiatives, the role of the teacher’s faith and student engagement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the present paper, the forced convective heat transfer was experimentally studied in packed beds with uniform and non-uniform spheres. The pore structures of different packings were reconstructed with discrete element method, and the lateral porosity distributions were analyzed. Furthermore, the pressure drop, heat transfer and overall heat transfer performances of different packings were investigated and compared with each other. Firstly, it is found that, using laterally layered composite packing (LLM), smaller pores would be formed close to the tube wall and big flow channels would be formed in the inner-tube region, which would reduce the tube-wall effect in the near tube wall region of packed bed. When compared with mono-sized packing with lower tube to particle diameter ratio, both the heat transfer and overall heat transfer capacities would be improved with LLM packing method. Secondly, it is found that, using randomly composite packing (RCM) or axially layered composite packing (ALM), both the lateral porosity magnitude and amplitude of packed bed are lower than those of mono-sized packing with higher tube to particle diameter ratio in the near tube-wall region. The tube-wall effect would be further reduced, and both the heat transfer and overall heat transfer capacities would also be improved with RCM and ALM packing methods.",

        "abstract": "Background Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Computer-based training programs can improve cognitive performance in elderly populations. However, the effects of computer-based interventions on MCI APOE ε4 carriers have never been studied before. Objective The effects of different web-based interventions and the APOE isoform-specific differences in training outcomes are investigated. Methods Using a quasi-experimental study design, 202 participants with MCI aged 60 years and older took part in three different intervention programs (physical and cognitive [Long-Lasting Memories, or LLM], cognitive [Active Control, or AC], or physical intervention [Physical Training Control, or PTC]) via an innovative information and communication technologies exergaming platform. Participants in each interventional group were subdivided into APOE ε4 carriers and non–APOE ε4 carriers. All participants underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation before and after the training, blood tests, and brain imaging. Results All interventions resulted in multiple statistically significant cognitive benefits after the intervention. Verbal learning (California Verbal Learning Test: immediate recall test score—LLM: P=.04; AC: P<.001), working memory (digit span forward and backward test scores—AC: P=.03; PTC: P=.02 and P=.006, respectively), and long-term memory (California Verbal Learning Test: delayed recall test score—LLM: P=.02; AC: P=.002; and PTC: P=.02) were improved. There was no statistically significant difference among the intervention effects. APOE ε4 presence moderates intervention effects as the LLM intervention improved only their task-switching processing speed (Trail Making Test, Part B: P=.03) and the PTC intervention improved only the working memory (digit span backward: P=.03). No significant performance alteration was noted for the APOE ε4+ cognitive AC training group. Conclusions None of the applied interventions could be identified as the optimal one; it is suggested, however, that combined cognitive and physical training and physical training via exergaming may be more effective for the high-risk MCI ΑPOE ε4+ subgroup.",

The genome of strain DM2 consists of a circular chromosome of 4,238,631 bp for 4458 protein-coding genes and a plasmid of 84,240 bp coding for 103 genes. Thirty-four genomic islands coding for 330 proteins and 5 prophages are found in the genome. The DDH value shows that strain DM2 belongs to B. subtilis subsp. subtilis subspecies, but significant variations of the genome are also present. Comparative analysis showed that the genome of strain DM2 encodes some strain-specific proteins in comparison with B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168, such as carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase family protein, gfo/Idh/MocA family oxidoreductases, GlsB/YeaQ/YmgE family stress response membrane protein, HlyC/CorC family transporters, LLM class flavin-dependent oxidoreductase, and LPXTG cell wall anchor domain-containing protein. Most of the common strain-specific proteins in DM2 and MJ01 strains, or proteins unique to DM2 strain, are involved in the pathways related to stress response, signaling, and hydrocarbon degradation. Furthermore, the strain DM2 genome contains 122 genes coding for developed two-component systems and 138 genes coding for ABC transporter systems. The prominent features of the strain DM2 genome reflect the evolutionary fitness of this strain to harsh conditions and hydrocarbon utilization.",

Both compare observed frequencies (foi…k) with expected frequencies (fei…k). While LLM uses primarily a model-fitting approach, CFA analyzes residuals of non-fitting models. Residuals with significantly more observed than expected frequencies (foi…k>fei…k) are called types, while residuals with significantly less observed than expected frequencies (foi…k<fei…k) are called antitypes. The R package confreq is presented and its use is demonstrated with several data examples. Results of contingency table analyses can be displayed in tables but also in graphics representing the size and type of residual. The expected frequencies represent the null hypothesis and different null hypotheses result in different expected frequencies. Different kinds of CFAs are presented: the first-order CFA based on the null hypothesis of independence, CFA with covariates, and the two-sample CFA. The calculation of the expected frequencies can be controlled through the design matrix which can be easily handled in confreq.",

The main freshwater sources to the LLM flow from the North and Central waterways which are composed of three main waterways: Hidalgo/Willacy Main Drain (HWMD), Raymondville Drain (RVD), and International Boundary & Water Commission North Floodway (IBWCNF) that are not fully characterized. The objective of this study is to perform a watershed characterization to determine the potential pollution sources of each watershed. The watershed characterization was achieved by developing a cyberinfrastructure, and it collects a wide inventory of data to identify which one of the three waterways has a major contribution to the LLM. Cyberinfrastructure development using the Geographic Information System (GIS) database helped to comprehend the major characteristics of each area contributing to the watershed supported by the analysis of the data collected. The watershed characterization process started with delineating the boundaries of each watershed. Then, geospatial and non-geospatial data were added to the cyberinfrastructure from numerous sources including point and nonpoint sources of pollution. Results showed that HWMD and IBWCNF watersheds were found to have a higher contribution to the water impairments to the LLM. HWMD and IBWCNF comprise the potential major sources of water quality impairments such as cultivated crops, urbanized areas, on-site sewage facilities, colonias, and wastewater effluents.",

        "abstract": "The inward particle flux associated with the global long-lived mode (LLM) during the L–I–H transition on HL-2A tokamak has been measured. The inward particle flux arises from the phase change between density and radial velocity fluctuations, where density and velocity fluctuations are strongly correlated with magnetic fluctuations of LLM. Moreover, the radial velocity and its gradient rather than poloidal flow shear play an important role in particle transport associated with the large-scale mode. The strong nonlinear coupling between LLM and ambient turbulence has been confirmed, and this may contribute to most of the inward particle flux in the LLM during the I-phase state.",

Using Dutch administrative data, we define local labour markets (LLMs) based on employees’ commuting outcomes, gender and educational attainment. We show that high-educated employees and male employees have a relatively large LLM. Using a continuum of regional aggregations, we find that urban wage premium estimates increase over the level of aggregation, also for different subgroups of employees. We show that the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) does not explain this pattern, consistent with stronger agglomeration externalities at higher regional aggregation levels.",

        "abstract": "Clinical management of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) resulting from androgen deprivation therapy remains challenging. CRPC is driven by aberrant activation of androgen receptor (AR) through mechanisms ranging from its amplification, mutation, post-translational modification, and expression of splice variants (e.g., AR-V7). Herein, we present experimental evidence for therapeutic vulnerability of CRPC to a novel phytochemical, leelamine (LLM), derived from pine tree bark. Exposure of human prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP (an androgen-responsive cell line with mutant AR), C4-2B (an androgen-insensitive variant of LNCaP), and 22Rv1 (a CRPC cell line with expression of AR-Vs), and a murine prostate cancer cell line Myc-CaP to plasma achievable concentrations of LLM resulted in ligand-dependent (LNCaP) and ligand-independent (22Rv1) growth inhibition in vitro that was accompanied by downregulation of mRNA and/or protein levels of full-length AR as well as its splice variants, including AR-V7. LLM treatment resulted in apoptosis induction in the absence and presence of R1881. In silico modeling followed by luciferase reporter assay revealed a critical role for noncovalent interaction of LLM with Y739 in AR activity inhibition. Substitution of the amine group with an isothiocyanate functional moiety abolished AR and cell viability inhibition by LLM. Administration of LLM resulted in 22Rv1 xenograft growth suppression that was statistically insignificant but was associated with a significant decrease in Ki-67 expression, mitotic activity, expression of full-length AR and AR-V7 proteins, and secretion of PSA.

Lower limb lean mass (LLM) was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, lower limb muscle strength (LMS) using a dynamometer, and lower limb muscle quality (LMQ) calculated as LMS/LLM. Knee pain and dysfunction were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index. PA was measured using pedometers. Linear-mixed effect regression models, with adjustment for confounders, were used to estimate the association of within-person and between-person variability in PA, 25(OH)D, and WOMAC scores with muscle mass, strength, and muscle quality.\n\n\nResults\nBoth between-person and within-person increases in PA were associated with LLM, LMS, and LMQ (all P < 0.05). Within-person and between-person increases in knee pain and dysfunction were associated with LLS and LMQ, but not with LLM (all P < 0.05). Between-person effects showed that higher average 25(OH)D was associated with a higher 10-year average LLM, LMS, and LMQ (all P < 0.05), whereas within-person increases in average 25(OH)D were associated with a higher LMS and LMQ, but not with LLM.\n\n\nConclusions\nVariability in 25(OH)D, pain, and dysfunction within an individual over time is related to muscle changes in that individual. Increasing one's own PA level further increases muscle mass, strength, and quality supporting the clinical recommendation of promoting PA to reduce age-related muscle loss.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES\nTo investigate whether multidisciplinary team (MDT) intervention is associated with improved survival for patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma with liver or lung metastasis (CRA-LLM).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe enrolled 161 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed CRA-LLM at Taipei Medical University-Wan Fang Hospital between January 2007 and December 2017. In total, 75 patients with CRA-LLM received MDT intervention, and 86 patients did not receive MDT intervention. To evaluate prognostic factors for overall death, we performed univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses of the overall death rate in all patients. Overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared using the log-rank test (P < .001).\n\n\nRESULTS\nA multivariate Cox regression analysis of the overall death rate in patients with CRA-LLM showed that age ≤ 65 years, systemic chemotherapy, curative-intent treatments, and MDT intervention are strong prognostic factors. The adjusted hazard ratio of death risk for age ≤ 65 years, systemic chemotherapy, curative-intent treatments, and MDT intervention were 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.92; P = .019), 0.19 (95% CI, 0.12-0.32; P = .001), 0.25 (95% CI, 0.13-0.50; P = .001), and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.25-0.65; P = .001), respectively. The 3-year overall survival rates in patients with CRA-LLM receiving MDT intervention and not receiving MDT intervention were 48.75% and 24.21%, respectively.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMDT intervention is associated with improved survival for patients with CRA-LLM.",

        "abstract": "This Article reveals the significance of a new and growing minority group within US law schools—international students in the Juris Doctor (JD) program. While international students have received some attention in legal education scholarship, it mostly has been focused on their participation in the context of programs specially designed for this demographic (e.g. postgraduate programs like the LLM and SJD). Drawing from interview data with fifty-eight international JD students across seventeen graduating US law schools, our research reveals the rising importance of international students as actors within a more mainstream institutional context. In examining the ways these students navigate their law school environments, we find that although international status often impacts identity and participation, not all students encounter its impact similarly. Particularly, while some students use the identity to their advantage, others cannot escape negative implications, even with effort. This is consistent with other scholarship on minority students, and adds to a growing literature that uses their socialization experiences to better understand professional stratification. To unpack these different ways of “being international,” we borrow from Goffman’s theorization of stigma to suggest illustrative variations in the ways international students experience their environments. In doing so, we offer an introductory landscape to better understand this growing population and hope this enables new insights to theorize about other kinds of minority experience.",

In Experiment l, one hundred and twenty-eight layers of the commercial \"Gold Links\" cross were randomly assigned to 4 dietary treatment groups of 32 birds each in a completely randomized design. Treatments consisted of 3% ALM, 3% LLM, 0.1 mg/kg supplemental riboflavin, and a control. In Experiment 2, post molt layers were fed diets that consisted of two levels of LLM (0, 3%) and two sources of calcium (commercial limestone, crushed coral). Results of Experiment 1 indicates that LLM, at 3% inclusion without supplemental iron salts, is comparable to imported ALM. Both LLM and ALM diets significantly improved feed consumption (p < 0.05). In Experiment 2, LLM significantly improved feed consumption and hen-day egg production (p < 0.05), however shell thickness was significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Hens receiving crushed coral diets maintained significantly higher egg production and body weight (p < 0.05), compared to those on commercial limestone. Source of calcium, and source of calcium X LLM interaction were also significant (p < 0.05) with respect to body weight.",

        "abstract": "Confusion, or passing off, is a typical unfair practice recognized internationally, but national laws still differ from each other. Although the Chinese Anti-Unfair Competition Law of 1993 provided a narrow rule on passing off, a rich amount of case law has considerably enlarged its scope of application. The reform of the passing off regime in 2017 was essentially based on case law. This reform consists of four main aspects: expansion of the scope of protectable commercial signs: clarification of the applicability of the passing off rule to registered and unregistered trademarks; the adjustment of fame as a qualifying condition of passing off; and the adoption of a general rule prohibiting confusion. This reform has not only consolidated the case law and approach developed by the courts, but also bestowed an open and flexible spirit in the passing off regime which will enhance its efficiency in the fight against unfair imitation.\n\n*PhD (University of Paris I – Pantheon Sorbonne), LLM (Renmin University of China), LLB (Shandong University), Director of the Innovation & Competition Law Center, Former Vice-President of the Trademark & Unfair Competition Committee of the IP Case Law Center (Beijing) of the Chinese Supreme People's Court, Vice President of the Beijing IP Judicial Protection Association, Expert Council Member of China Trademark Association, Co-Chair of American Society of International Law Intellectual Property Interest Group, Visiting Professor or Research Fellow (University of Milan, University of Toulouse I, University of Paris I, University of Paris XI, Max Plank Institute for Procedural Law and Strasbourg University CEIPI).

        "abstract": "The present study is the first to report inhibition of breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo and suppression of self‐renewal of breast cancer stem cells (bCSC) by a pine bark component (leelamine). Except for a few recent publications in melanoma, anticancer pharmacology of this interesting phytochemical is largely elusive. Leelamine (LLM) dose‐dependently inhibited viability of MDA‐MB‐231 (triple‐negative), MCF‐7 (estrogen receptor‐positive), and SUM159 (triple‐negative) human breast cancer cells in association with apoptotic cell death induction. To the contrary, a normal mammary epithelial cell line derived from fibrocystic breast disease and spontaneously immortalized (MCF‐10A) was fully resistant to LLM‐mediated cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction. LLM also inhibited self‐renewal of breast cancer stem cells. Apoptosis induction by LLM in breast cancer cells was accompanied by a modest increase in reactive oxygen species production, which was not due to inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes. Nevertheless, ectopic expression of manganese superoxide dismutase conferred partial protection against LLM‐induced cell death but only at a lower yet pharmacologically relevant concentration. Exposure of breast cancer cells to LLM resulted in (a) induction and/or activation of multidomain proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak, (b) caspase‐9 activation, and (c) cytosolic release of cytochrome c. Bax and Bak deficiency in immortalized fibroblasts conferred significant protection against cell death by LLM. Intraperitoneal administration of LLM (7.5 mg/kg; 5 times/wk) suppressed the growth of orthotopic SUM159 xenografts in mice without any toxicity. In conclusion, the present study provides critical preclinical data to warrant further investigation of LLM. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "Background and objectives: Persistent wheezing (PW) is defined as prolonged or recurrent episodes of wheezing despite regular treatment. Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is recommended to determine the etiology of PW in children. This study aimed to determine the etiology of PW based on FB findings in a national pediatric center. Materials and Methods: Children presenting with PW that underwent flexible bronchoscopy from April 2016 to August 2019 at the Mother and Child Health Institute of Serbia were included in this observational study. After endoscopic evaluation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were taken and further analyzed. Quantitative microbiology, cytological analysis and oil-red staining of specimens were performed to determine cellular constituents and presence of lipid laden macrophages (LLM). Upper gastrointestinal series were performed to exclude gastroesophageal reflux disease, swallowing dysfunction and vascular ring. Results: Pathological findings were revealed in 151 of 172 study participants, with bacterial lower airway infection (BLAI) (48.3%) and primary bronchomalacia (20.4%) as the most common. Younger participants were hospitalized for significantly longer periods (ρ = −0.366, p < 0.001). Study participants with BLAI and associated mucus plugging were notably younger (p < 0.001). Presence of LLM in BALF was not associated with findings of upper gastrointestinal series. All patients with confirmed BLAI were treated with oral antibiotics. Although FB is considered to be invasive, there were no complications associated with the procedure. Conclusions: Flexible bronchoscopy has an exceptional diagnostic value in evaluation of PW. In younger patients with BLAI, presence of mucus plugs may complicate the clinical course, so significant benefits can be achieved with therapeutic lavage during bronchoscopy.",

        "abstract": "The initial channels of thermal decomposition mechanism of 2,6-diamino-3,5-dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) molecule were investigated. The results of quantum chemical calculations revealed four candidates involved in the reaction pathway, including the C–NO2 bond homolysis, nitro–nitrite rearrangement followed by NO elimination, and H transfer from amino to acyl O and to nitro O with the subsequent OH or HONO elimination, respectively. In view of the further kinetic analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the C–NO2 bond homolysis was suggested to be the dominant step that triggered the decomposition of LLM-105 at temperatures above 580 K. Below this temperature, two types of H transfer were considered as the primary reactions, which have advantages including lower barrier and high rate compared to the C–NO2 bond dissociation. It could be affirmed that these two types of H transfer are reversible processes, which could buffer against external thermal stimulation. Therefore, the excellent thermal stability of LLM-105, that is nearly identical to that of 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene, can be attributed to the reversibility of H transfers at relatively low temperatures. However, subsequent OH or HONO elimination reactions occur with difficulty because of their slow rates and extra energy barriers. Although nitro–nitrite rearrangement is theoretically feasible, its rate constant is too small to be observed. This study facilitates the understanding of the essence of thermal stability and detailed decomposition mechanism of LLM-105.",

        "abstract": "To gain insight into crystalline protein dynamics, we performed molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of a periodic 2×2×2 supercell of staphylococcal nuclease. We used the resulting MD trajectories to simulate X-ray diffraction and to study collective motions. The agreement of simulated X-ray diffraction with the data is comparable to previous MD simulation studies. We studied collective motions by analyzing statistically the covariance of alpha-carbon position displacements. The covariance decreases exponentially with the distance between atoms, which is consistent with a liquid-like motions (LLM) model, in which the protein behaves like a soft material. To gain finer insight into the collective motions, we examined the covariance behavior within a protein molecule (intra-protein) and between different protein molecules (inter-protein). The inter-protein atom pairs, which dominate the overall statistics, exhibit LLM behavior; however, the intra-protein pairs exhibit behavior that is consistent with a superposition of LLM and rigid-body motions (RBM). Our results indicate that LLM behavior of global dynamics is present in MD simulations of a protein crystal. They also show that RBM behavior is detectable in the simulations but that it is subsumed by the LLM behavior. Finally the results provide clues about how correlated motions of atom pairs both within and across proteins might manifest in diffraction data. Overall our findings increase our understanding of the connection between molecular motions and diffraction data, and therefore advance efforts to extract information about functionally important motions from crystallography experiments.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAchalasia is currently classified in three manometric patterns. Pattern III is the least common pattern, and reportedly correlated with the worst outcome after all available treatments. We aimed to investigate the final outcome in pattern III achalasia patients after classic laparoscopic myotomy (CLM) as compared with a myotomy lengthened both downward and upward (long laparoscopic myotomy [LLM]).\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe study population consisted of 61 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of pattern III achalasia who underwent laparoscopic myotomy between 1997 and 2017. In CLM the total length of the myotomy was ≤9 cm, whereas myotomies extending both downward and upward to a length >9 cm were defined as LLM.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOf the 61 patients considered, 24 had CLM and 37 had LLM. The postoperative improvement in symptom score differed between the two groups: it dropped from 22 (17-26) to 4 (0-8) in the CLM group and from 20 (17-24) to 3 (0-6) in the LLM group (P < .001). There were 8 of 24 failures (33.3%) in the former group and 4 of 37 (10.8%) in the latter group (P < .05). An abnormal acid exposure was detected after the treatment of CLM in 4 patients and after the treatment of LLM in 3 patients (P = n.s.).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough with the intrinsic limitations of this study (retrospective, different time windows of the two procedures, and different lengths of follow-up), the results indicate that extending the myotomy both downward and upward improves the final outcome of laparoscopic Heller-Dor surgery in pattern III achalasia patients. A longer myotomy does not affect any onset of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux.",

This paper reviews domestic and foreign studies into high-nitrogen azine energetic materials. The synthetic methods, structural and theoretical analysis, physical and chemical properties, sensitivity properties, thermal properties and detonation properties of some typical pyrazine energetic compounds are summarised, including: 2,6-diamino-3,5dinitropyrazine-1-oxide (LLM-105) of diazines, 4,4′,6,6′-tetra(azido)azo-1,3,5-triazine (TAAT) of triazines, 3,6-dihydrazino-1,2,4,5-tetrazine (DHT), 3,6-bis(1H-1,2,3,4-tetrazol-5-yl-amino)-1,2,4,5tetrazine (BTATz) and 3,3′-azobis(6-amino-1,2,4,5tetrazine) (DAAT) of tetrazine and their respective applications and potential value are described. The results of published studies reviewed here show that the application of azine energetic compounds in propellants can effectively improve the burning rate and reduce the characteristic signal; the application of azine energetic compounds in mixed explosives can reduce the sensitivity and improve the detonation performance; the application of azine energetic compounds in gas generators can reduce the combustion temperature and increase the gas content. Therefore, this class of compounds has a broad application prospect in energetic materials.",

Patients and Methods: The target populations were persons diagnosed with atrial fibrillation or osteoarthritis, who were prescribed anticoagulants or over-the-counter or prescription pain medications, respectively. In this two-stage, multi-year, qualitative research study, relevant concepts were explored, confirmed and refined. The focus was on non-adherence due to active (thus potentially modifiable) patient decisions to forego taking medications as prescribed. Results: The most common concerns among participants with atrial fibrillation were medication-related side effects and fear of bleeding. Participants with osteoarthritis were most concerned about short-term stomach problems and long-term kidney and liver side effects. The Concerns Influencing Medication Adherence (CIMA) instrument was developed based on these concerns and those identified in the literature. It is comprised of 16 items: a core set of 11 items potentially applicable to multiple disease states, 3 items specific to atrial fibrillation, and 2 items unique to osteoarthritis. The instrument is intended to be completed electronically, and publicly available for use in direct patient care in the United States or in population health management. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first instrument focused on medication adherence that includes documented details of patient input as recommended by the United States Food and Drug Administration guidance. Patient input is considered a key component of content validity. In this research, for example, the concerns that patients have regarding their treatments can be expected to have affected past medication adherence and can potentially impact future adherence. Although applicability outside atrial fibrillation or osteoarthritis was not assessed, the general items may be useful in assessing adherence in other chronic diseases.",

The historical method was used to examine the system of the Bulgarian legal education that has been developing for about 130 years and has gone through numerous difficulties.The comparative and juxtaposition approach were utilsed in the research to help in making inferences about the present situation regarding legal education in Bulgaria. Now there are nine law schools that deepen international co-operation and adapt their curricula to respond to the changes in national and European legislation.It takes five years to receive a legal education in Bulgaria and the process ends with a Master’s degree in Law (LLM). There is no Bachelor degree in Law (LLB in other European countries) in our country.All in all, the main objective of this article is to look at the Bulgarian legal education in the past and nowadays. The paper attempts to show that legal education in Bulgaria is faced with diverse challenges of the new millennium.

Sein Tun, MS, OMS-II; stun@student.touro.edu Hao Luong, MS, OMS-II; hluong2@student.touro.edu Weldon E Havins, MD, JD, LLM, FCLM, Emeritus Professor Touro University Nevada College of Osteopathic Medicine, Henderson, Nevada Voting is the most basic way a citizen can have his or her voice heard. It is also one of the easiest ways for an individual to participate in changing or maintaining the legislation. Voting registration and participation can allow citizens to have a direct impact on the healthcare system, which is an essential aspect of policy making within the United States’ political system. Physicians are the most equipped with knowledge about the healthcare system, therefore, there is a need to increase voting amongst physician populations. Physicians’ votes and influence on health policy impact not only the medical community but their patients as well. To improve the healthcare system for both physicians and their patients, the candidates chosen to become legislators must align with the views held by their constituents. As registered voters and constituents of an Assemblyperson and a Senator, physicians can actively voice their concerns and ideas that could potentially contribute to new and improved legislation. However, the first and most important step in getting involved is to register to vote. When compared to other higher education professionals such as lawyers, physicians are less active in politics. This needs to be improved because healthcare policy contributes to a large portion of political discussion. In order to promote physician engagement in politics, there must be promotion of registration to vote. One benefit is that it is especially easy to register now because it can be done conveniently online. This study aims to improve physician voter registration outcomes by identifying physicians in Clark County who are not registered voters and contacting them to discuss the importance of voting and how to register online. However, because of limited information available from the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) and the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) databases, the only feasible method of contact to physicians is through mailing physical letters to their work offices. The method utilized in this study is not effective because it lacked sufficient time to allow the letters to be received by physicians before the data was 2021 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2021, VOL. 41, NO.

Although this study could not prove that mailing letters to the physicians’ office of practice is an adequate method, it did show that approximately 74% of physicians in Clark County are registered voters, which is of higher percentage than the general population of Nevada. Nonetheless, this number does not account for other variables that may influence lack of voter participation amongst physicians such as time constraints due to work commitments. Recommendation for modifications to future studies are included in order to refine the methods used. In spite of the lack of significant results, this research is intended to stimulate physician voter registration and there is hope that at the very least, the sent letters have increased physician awareness and inspire them to register to vote and participate in future elections.

These patients may request euthanasia with the intent to make an autonomous decision and gain back some control that they have lost to the disease. As physicians, we should strive to understand the rationale behind the patient’s request of euthanasia to alleviate suffering and provide the most suitable care that preserves the patients’ dignity and autonomy. The purpose of our research is to propose the legalization of euthanasia in Nevada for terminal patients. To examine the legality and morality of euthanasia, we applied the four biomedical ethics principles (autonomy, justice, beneficence, and maleficence) to the use of this practice. The number of cases of euthanasia and Physician-Assisted Suicides (PAS) in Netherlands and Canada were analyzed. Reports of PAS cases in Canada were obtained from Regional Euthanasia Review Committees and Interim Reports. Individual statutes and numerous studies were reviewed to compare the qualifications and requirements of euthanasia and PAS in different countries. This study found that in countries where both euthanasia and PAS are legal, euthanasia occurs at a higher rate than PAS. In Netherlands, the incidence of euthanasia from 2002 and 2010 to 2018 was 1672, 2910, 5277, 5856, 6303, and 5898 whereas PAS was 184, 182, 208, 216, 250, and 212. In Canada, the occurrence of euthanasia from 2016 to 2018 was 503, 1960, and 2613 compared to four, one, and one PAS cases. Although euthanasia is illegal in the United States, patients showed higher support for euthanasia over PAS, finding euthanasia to be more acceptable (67%) than assisted suicide (33%). We carefully compared and studied the qualifications of euthanasia in other countries to propose our guidelines for Nevada. We acknowledge that there should be strict limitations and documentation of cases to limit its abuse. Further studies are needed to examine the validity of child euthanasia or other vulnerable populations. More 2021 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2021, VOL. 41, NO.

        "abstract": "The article addresses the role of legal theory in legal education. Today, a multitude of perspectives is present within legal theory and, as a subject, it is not as distinct as it is sometimes claimed to be. It is evident when considering syllabuses in the Nordic countries that nearly all LLM programmes have ambitions to teach legal theory as embracing a multitude of theoretical and methodological perspectives. This multitude of perspectives promises adaptable content for the subject of legal theory in various legal contexts, and could facilitate a reflection on how knowledge is acquired and why. The challenge addressed in the article is the presence of explicit or implicit ideas from the subject of legal theory as comprising a coherent “legal method” and a specific list of accepted theories. The persistence of such ideas is scrutinised in this article with help of the concepts of “professional knowledge” and “scholarly knowledge”. In order to navigate the complex field of legal theories, students need meta-reflective skills, which means the ability to reflect upon the underlying complexity and multitude of the subject. This is shown by a case study from the Department of Law at the University of Gothenburg, together with examples from curricula and textbooks from legal theory courses across the Nordic countries.",

        "abstract": "Health care is one of the most important spheres of activities of the state and society. The functioning and development of health care require proper legal support that is possible if there are enough qualified lawyers equipped with profound knowledge and skills in the health law area. The paper discusses the concept of health law that is new for the Ukrainian legal science as well as its integral components – medical law, public health law, and pharmaceutical law. The experience of teaching courses pertaining to the realm of health law at the Taras Schevtchenko National University of Kyiv that is the leader of Ukrainian higher education, particularly the legal one, is examined. It is the law faculty (currently – the Institute of Law) of the said University whereat the innovative discipline \"Legal regulation of public health\" (\"Public Health Law\") started to be taught for the first time in Ukraine. In 2019, the LLM specialization (the elective block of courses) \"Health Law\" that was unique for Ukraine, was introduced. The article mentions the key goals at the attainment of which the courses studied within the framework of the \"Health Law\" LLM program (totally ISSN 1728-2195 ЮРИДИЧНІ НАУКИ. 3(118)/2021 ~ 21 ~ 12 disciplines), are targeted. It analyzes the list and content of the courses belonging to the said LLM specialization that can be conditionally divided into three blocks: the key disciplines covering the \"components\" of health law; the disciplines ensuring understanding of the peculiarities of activities in the sphere of health care and the legal tools used for the governance in health care and management of healthcare institutions; and the courses directed at covering the topical issues of law and ethics in health care and at acquiring practical skills of protection of rights of healthcare actors. The paper points out that while teaching courses falling within the \"Health Law\" LLM specialization, major stress was made on getting students acquainted with the realities of practice. It pays attention to the use of modern methods and approaches to teaching as well as education technologies that allowed ensuring high efficiency of education, particularly under the conditions of lockdown caused by the spread of coronavirus disease COVID-19. The article also outlines major components of the education and scientific activity carried out at the Taras Shevtchenko National University of Kyiv, including that of the Education and Research Center for Medical Law of the Institute of Law. The conclusion is made that а scientific school of health law has been established at the Taras Shevtchenko National University of Kyiv.

        "abstract": "Direct ion imaging is a strong point of the CAMECA IMS 3f ion microscope, but has undergone little commercial development. A modified image acquisition system is presented which incorporates a high sensitivity' video camera allied with a rapid image digitizer/processor. Individual ion impacts on the channel plate are detected at maximum gain and image sensitivity is effectively increased to that of the mass spectrometer. For intermediate (103 to 105) and low (< 103) count rates image processing such as averaging or integration is essential to improve the poor detection statistics and allow real time image formation. Rapid image processing means that ion micrographs are immediately ready for interpretation or storage on a suitable medium. The improved instrument performance is illustrated from the point of view of materials science research: the routine use of an optimum lateral resolution, imaging at high mass resolution (M/LlM = 20,000), improved imaging for insulating samples, trace element/molecular ion imaging and high quality images suitable for rapid transfer to an image analyzer for detailed quantitative analysis.",

The present study retrospectively compared the clinical outcomes and imaging features of patients with unstable intertrochanteric hip fractures treated with traditional extramedullary hip screws (AO/OTA 31-A2) and patients with the same injury treated with newer intramedullary screws.\n\n\nMETHODS\nLower limb measurement (LLM) for the main results of the hip-specific tools, functional independence measure (FIM), and \"timed up and go\" (TUG) to test the scale and timing of the 2-minute walk test were used as secondary tools for clinical outcomes. Other detailed radiological parameters to evaluate the fracture movement, such as heterotopic ossification, and implant failure, were also recorded.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were no significant differences between the intramedullary and extramedullary treatment groups in terms of the measures acquired by the primary or secondary clinical outcome tools (P>0.05), but the radiographic parameters favored the intramedullary treatment group as it showed reduced femoral neck shortening.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough treatment with intramedullary nailing resulted in better radiographic assessment results, this did not translate into better functional recovery outcomes.",

Hardy, MD, Associate Dean for Clinical Education Weldon Havins, MD, JD, LLM, FCLM, Emeritus Professor Touro University Nevada College of Osteopathic Medicine, NV Ever since the introduction of transplant surgery in the latter half of the 20th century, organ transplantation has improved the lives of thousands of people around the world. However, the demand for organs is steadily rising while the supply remains limited. This inevitably leads well-to-do individuals, placed on lengthy organ waiting lists, to seek organ transplants abroad in less ethical and less legal ways. Many procure these organs in China, where it is believed that non-consenting Falun Gong practitioners are persecuted, placed in detention centers or labor camps and illegally harvested for their organs. There are also issues of illegal brokers taking advantage of vulnerable individuals in developing nations, such as the Philippines and Moldova. However, regardless of how the organs are acquired, “organ tourists” are met with virtually no legal repercussions. The increasing need for organs has created a global issue. This practice, called “organ tourism”, has been condemned, but not criminalized, by the greater international community in the Declaration of Istanbul, created in 2008 and supported by over 150 countries. Though internationally condemned, engagement in “organ tourism” has seen an increase in recent years. There are currently no U.S. laws prohibiting organ tourism, nor are there any mandates requiring physicians to report patients who have participated in organ tourism. Therefore, physicians are faced with an ethical dilemma; in what capacity, if any, to advise their patients regarding organ transplantation abroad. This review utilizes the Army’s 7 Steps in Problem Solving Model to provide a concise and conclusive framework to determine if there exists an ethical obligation for physicians to advise their patients of foreign transplant alternatives. By following the Army’s 7 Steps in Problem Solving Model, certain guiding criteria are established, such as: non-judgmental regard and fiduciary responsibility for patients who return with transplanted organs, deterring hopeful transplant patients from involving 2021 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2021, VOL. 41, NO.

This review concludes it is the physicians ethical duty to advise their patients of foreign options to obtain organ transplantation. However, there should be no obligation to inform patients of transplant organ systems which take part in highly unethical practices, such as those considered to be participating in crimes against humanity.

        "title": "EDITORIAL",
        "abstract": "It is just possible that you have not heard of Mrs M Dickinson of 159 Marine Parade, Kemp Town, Brighton. This would be rather a pity because Mrs Dickinson discovered radioleum (otherwise Organic Radium) in 1913. In a neat little book called A New Activity? written by one Frank A Hotblack and published by Jarrolds of London (195 pages and 18 B/W plates) the story and properties of radioleum are recounted. The frontispiece is a photograph of Mrs Dickinson in a well-filled pinstripe suit with a wry smile, a couple of medals, a fur stole, a plumed hat and her thumb in her jacket pocket. The text (endorsed incidentally by Alfred W Oke BA LLM FCS FGS ETC) first of all gives a reasonable account for the time - 1920 - of the nature and properties of radium and then moves on to its main theme, the matter of Mrs D. After the death of her husband she began, in 1911, her researches into the `perfect antiseptic'. Although born in Somerset and raised in Iowa Mrs D had travelled widely in the East and been impressed by the healing, health-giving and preserving qualities of vegetable oils. She developed from these, using inter alia the oils of cinnabar and Silvester, an antiseptic perfume which she gave the alluring name `Dongor' in memory of the late Mr Dickinson. While working on an allied product in 1913 - an Antiseptic Medical Cream-Soap - under the general guidance of some ancient Egyptian texts, she noticed that there was a precipitation of tiny reddish-brown particles on the surface and immediately cried `Radium!'. She showed these to her intimates and to a knowledgeable journalist, Mr Cayley Calvert, who remarked that they looked like pitchblende. (How many journalists today would recognise a fragment of pitchblende, one might demand.) A `head chemist' said, with remarkable insight, that they looked like refined pitchblende, while a more romantic colleague thought they resembled Mount Vesuvius erupting. Mrs D, in a subsequent experiment with a Bunsen burner, caused an explosion that converted these rather pedestrian crystals into sparkling, adamantine ones and discovered that these had remarkable properties that were in a strange way reminiscent of radium - only more so. Mr D's name was Gordon in case you were wondering. In the book the properties of the crystals are elaborated in some detail but here we must be brief. They: cleaned dirty wool, had a stimulating effect on the growth of wallflowers, separated gold from arsenic, made excellent bread without yeast, caused marks on glass strangely similar to those in C T R Wilson's cloud chamber, removed scale from boilers, made better cement, made better coal, produced everlasting crystallised fruit, made hair grow, cured eczema and germinated frog spawn more quickly than nature. When sealed in a phial the crystals made water effervesce and produced a healthy drink. Some of these effects were independently witnessed. For example, W Wortley Baggally, a prominent member of the Society for Psychical Research, checked out the glass tracks. Mrs D reported her findings extensively in the journal of the Brighton and Hove Natural History and Philosophical Society. She approached a number of scientific luminaries of the time. Sir James Dewar, Sir Oliver Lodge, Sir William Barrett and Professor F W Keeble all commented on the discovery but in terms that were indicative of a certain reservation. Mrs Dickinson became a member of the Royal Institution on 4 December 1916, but perhaps the final word should be with Professor Wintour F Gwinnell BSc FGS of the Polytechnic College, Regent Street, who said `It is a mystery'. I bought this book some while ago and readers may believe that I should have kept that fact to myself. But it has subsequently symbolised to me the awe in which radioactivity has been held since its discovery. A menagerie of magical elements so wonderful that it was worth invoking the spirits of the Pharaohs to create something similar. Of course, the magic has become a little blacker in recent years.

Owing to the 20-s temporal resolution of PX-1000, a detailed radar analysis of the hook echo is performed on (1) the microphysical characteristics through a hydrometeor classification algorithm (HCA)—inter-compared between X- and S-band for performance evaluation—including a hail and debris class and (2) kinematic properties of the low-level mesocyclone (LLM) assessed through ΔVr analyses. Four transient intensifications in ΔVr prior to tornadogenesis are documented and found to be associated with two prevalent internal rear-flank downdraft (RFD) momentum surges, the latter surge coincident with tornadogenesis. The momentum surges are marked by a rapidly advancing reflectivity (ZH) gradient traversing around the LLM, descending reflectivity cores (DRCs), a drop in differential reflectivity (ZDR) due to the advection of smaller drops into the hook echo, a decrease in correlation coefficient (ρhv), and the detection of debris from the HCA. Additionally, volumetric analyses of ZDR and specific differential phase (KDP) signatures show general diffusivity of the ZDR arc even after tornadogenesis in contrast with explosive deepening of the KDP foot downshear of the updraft. Similarly, while the vertical extent of the ZDR and KDP columns decrease leading up to tornadogenesis, the phasing of these signatures are offset after tornadogenesis, with the ZDR column deepening the lagging of KDP.",

Firstly, the generalized work of force is proposed to express the stressing state mode and its characteristic parameter. Then, the Mann-Kendall criterion is applied to detect the mutation point in the curve of the characteristic parameter with the load increase. Correspondingly, it is verified that the evolution of the stressing state mode also embodies the mutation feature. The stressing state mutation feature is inherent and common as the embodiment of the natural law from quantitative change to qualitative change of a system. The stressing state mutation feature reveals the starting point of structural failure process, which could update the existing definition of structural failure load. Further, the elastoplastic branch (EPB) point is revealed referring to the updated failure load, which might be directly taken as the design load with the rational margin of safety. In a sense, this paper presents a new way to address the classic issue of structural load-bearing capacity uncertainty and to update the existing design codes of LLM wall panels.",

Hardy, MD, Associate Dean for Clinical Education Weldon Havins, MD, JD, LLM, FCLM Touro University Nevada College of Osteopathic Medicine Background: The Opioid crisis is a nationwide epidemic with devastating consequences to American communities and public health. In 2018, 46,802 (70%) of all overdose deaths in the United States, and 372 drug overdose deaths in Nevada, were opioid-related. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is an effective “whole-patient” approach to the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD), combining medications with behavioral therapy and counseling. There are three FDAapproved medications indicated for opioid dependency: naltrexone, methadone, and buprenorphine. Treatment centers rarely offer naltrexone (XR-NTX, or Vivitrol available in injectable extended release form) compared with opioid agonist treatments. The goal of this study is to quantify prescribing patterns of MAT to treat OUD in Nevada and to understand the reasons addiction specialists do or do not prescribe it. Methods: A survey was created with questions designed and sent to practicing Nevada addiction specialists, including physicians (MD and DO), physician assistants, and nurse practitioners in the state of Nevada (Nevada Addiction Specialists hereafter), by mail. Results: Of 309 Nevada Addiction Specialists surveyed, 34 (11%) responded. Almost half (47%) of responding addiction specialists in Nevada prescribed XR-NTX, yet only 9% of OUD patients were treated with XR-NTX. The leading reasons addiction specialists prescribed XRNTX were the frequency of injections and the non-addictive nature of the drug. The leading reasons for not prescribing XR-NTX were its detoxification requirement (35% of respondents), accessibility (29%), and price (24%). Of the Nevada addiction specialists who did not prescribe XR-NTX, 28% were unfamiliar with the drug. Conclusion: The survey results suggest that XR-NTX is appropriate for only a small subset of patients with OUD, as indicated by the CDC and other studies. XR-NTX has potential in highly motivated patients that are 2021 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2021, VOL. 41, NO.

There may be a need for increasing awareness and education of MAT options earlier in medical training to bridge the gap in knowledge related to the treatments available for patients with OUD.

        "abstract": "Mortality of COVID-19 and Seasonal Influenza in Southern Nevada and the United States Nilsha Khurana, OMS-II; nkhurana@student.touro.edu Avneet Bedi, OMS-II; abedi2@student.touro.edu Weldon E Havins, MD, JD, LLM, FCLM, Professor Emeritus Touro University Nevada College of Osteopathic Medicine In early March 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a national pandemic by the World Health Organization. Many have claimed that COVID-19 is no more serious than the influenza. Although influenza and COVID-19 have some symptoms in common, COVID-19 is a more destructive virus. Because the virus that causes COVID-19 is newly introduced in human populations, there is an urgent need to know more about how the disease impacts human populations. The purpose of this study was to estimate and compare mortality rates between COVID-19 and influenza in Southern Nevada and in the United States. Data for Southern Nevada was collected from Southern Nevada Health District (SNHD) and covered COVID-19 and influenza deaths from 2016-2020. Nationwide data was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and covered 2016-2020 for both COVID-19 and influenza. Deaths per 100,000 people, which were attributable to influenza and Coronavirus, were calculated for the Southern Nevada population and for the United States population. After analyzing the data, it was found that there has been an average of 113.19/100,000 COVID deaths in Nevada since the discovery of the virus. On the other hand, for influenza, there has been an average of 1.8/100,000 deaths in Nevada for the past four flu seasons, which typically peaks between December and February. A similar trend is observed nationally. According to the CDC data, it was calculated that nationwide, there are about 111.55/100,000 COVID deaths. Contrarily, there are about 12.46/100,000 influenza-related deaths nationwide. According to the calculations, COVID-19 has a mortality rate higher than reported for influenza, both in Nevada and in the nation. The differences in mortality rates are linked to other important ways that COVID-19 differs from influenza. Because COVID-19 is novel, every individual is therefore susceptible to the virus. Awareness that COVID-19 is not just the flu needs to be made more vigorously. COVID-19 will be a more lethal virus than the influenza strains that seasonally affect world populations.

Hardy, MD, Associate Dean of Clinical Education Weldon Havins, MD, JD, LLM, MA, Emeritus Professor Touro University Nevada College of Osteopathic Medicine In accordance with the global opioid epidemic, the CDC issued guidelines for practitioners prescribing opioids for chronic pain. In response to these guidelines and to the opioid epidemic itself, Nevada issued restrictive legislation on practitioners prescribing opioids: SB 459, AB 474, and AB 239. To investigate the relationships between opioid legislature and opioidrelated death rates, data was obtained from the Nevada Board of Pharmacy and the Clark and Washoe County medical examiner offices. The data demonstrate that there was a significant decrease in prescriptions following the legislation; however, there was no correlation between the legislation and overall rate of opioid-related deaths because there was a subsequent and dramatic rise in deaths from illicit opioids. This suggests that more patients switched to the use of heroin and/or fentanyl as a result in limiting legal opioid prescribing power. A Spearman correlation was calculated (-0.04) and a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the time periods of the legislation implementation and the county. There were no interactions between the two counties and law; so, both counties experienced the same trends following these laws. To compare opioid-related deaths to opioid prescription rate for each time period, a t-test with law as the only factor was conducted with combined data from both counties (SB 459 p1⁄4 0.744; AB 474 p1⁄4 0.640; AB 239 p1⁄4 0.704). No significance was found. The COVID-19 Stay at Home order has statistically increased opioid-related deaths (p1⁄4 0.010), albeit it is unknown if this increase is due to Nevadans selfmedicating in response to work stoppages and financial stress, inability to see a practitioner in person, or restrictions involving addiction clinics during the pandemic. The goal of Nevada’s three opioid prescription bills was to reduce the rate of Nevadans dying from opioid overdoses, yet more Nevadans are dying from opioids now than before the bills passed.

These are our recommendations: (1) Base law requirements on guidelines provided by professional or governmental agencies that are medically oriented, (2) Discipline first with education, then with sanctions, and (3) Enforce requirements through an entity which is very familiar with the providers’ scope of practice, such as the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners and the Nevada State Board of Osteopathic Medicine.

        "abstract": "<p>In ecosystem biogeochemistry, Liebig&#8217;s law of the minimum (LLM) is one of the most widely used rules to model and interpret biological growth. Although it is intuitively accepted as being true, its mechanistic foundation has never been clearly presented. We here first show that LLM can be derived from the law of mass action, the state of art theory for modeling biogeochemical reactions. We further show that there are (at least) another two approximations (the synthesizing unit (SU) model and additive model) that are more accurate than LLM in approximating the law of mass action. We then evaluated the LLM, SU, and additive models against growth data of algae and plants. For algae growth, we found all three models are equally accurate, albeit with different parameter values. For plants, LLM failed to accurately model one dataset, and achieved equally good results for other datasets with very different parameters. We also find that LLM does not allow flexible elemental stoichiometry, which is an oft-observed characteristic of plants, when an organism&#8217;s growth is modeled as a function of substrate uptake flux. In summary, we caution the use of LLM for modeling biological growth if one is interested in representing the organisms&#8217; capability in adapting to different nutrient conditions.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>\n<p><br /><br /></p>",

        "abstract": "The problem of identifying unstructured nonlinear systems is generally addressed on the basis of multi-model representations involving several linear local models. In the present work, local models are combined to get a global representation using incremental fuzzy clustering. The main contribution is a novel vector similarity measure defined in the System Working Space (SWS) that combines the angular deviation and the usual Euclidean distance. Such a combination makes the new metric highly discriminating leading to a better partitioning of the operating space providing, thereby, a higher accuracy of the model. The developed partitioning method is first evaluated by performing linear local model (LLM) based identification of a academic benchmark multivariable nonlinear system. Then, the performances of the identification method are evaluated using experimental tropospheric ozone data. These evaluations illustrate the supremacy of the new method over the standard Euclidian-distance based partitioning approach.",

Introduction In the US, the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP) currently endorses 29 disorders for which newborns should be screened, given evidence of the benefits of early detection. With increasing knowledge of disease progression, new and improved treatment options, and development of efficient screening tests, the screening of newborns for lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) has been quickly gaining momentum in the last decade. In 2019, Nevada passed Senate Bill 291, mandating the screening of all conditions in the RUSP, including Pompe disease and mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I). Currently, improved screening technology can measure enzymatic activities for several LSDs in a single analysis, allowing for the conservation of labor, equipment, samples, and reagents. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of adding Fabry and Gaucher disease to Nevada’s newborn screening panel once screening for Pompe disease and MPS I has been established. Methods We performed a systematic review of literature to identify evidence on the natural history of Fabry and GD, as well as availability and effectiveness of treatment options and screening tests. We also compiled a list of costs associated with common clinical manifestations of Fabry and GD that commonly occur prior to diagnosis without an early detection program. We then compared these costs to the estimated costs of screening. Results We have estimated that the cost of adding on the screening of these two LSDs, once screening for Pompe and MPS I is established, will cost approximately $89,205 per year. The estimated costs of management of Fabry and GD in the absence of early detection and treatment are shown below: 2021 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2021, VOL. 41, NO.

        "abstract": "The use of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SION) in targeted drug delivery has become widespread because they can be directed at cancerous tissue by applying an external magnetic field. In this work, we used quantum chemical calculations to investigate whether SIONs are suitable for the anticancer drug lenalidomide (LLM). For this purpose, using a suitable model for SION in aqueous solution, seven possible configurations of drug-carrier interaction were considered (SION/LLM1-7). The binding energies of optimized configurations were evaluated at M06-2X/6-31G(d,p). The most stable configurations (SION/LLM6 and SION/LLM7) occur when the drug is parallel to the nanoparticle ring. In these cases, the most and strongest hydrogen bonds are obtained. Large negative values of binding and solvation energies indicate high drug loading and acceptable solubility. Due to the essential role of hydrogen bonds in this drug delivery system, these bonds were studied in detail by quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM).",

DSC measurements showed that ANPyO, TATB, NTO and LLM-105 were compatible with CL-20. The compatibility of CL-20/NQ, CL-20/TNT, CL-20/ANPyO, CL-20/TATB, CL-20/NTO and CL-20/LLM-105 mixtures was further explored using the VST, which revealed that all the selected insensitive explosives were compatible with CL-20. Possible chemical interactions were suspected for CL-20/TATB from the FTIR results and for CL-20/NTO from XRD analysis. In summary, ANPyO and LLM-105 demonstrated the optimal compatibility with CL-20.",

The cardiotoxicity in zebrafish of MC-1 was evaluated by means of specific phenotypic expressions and larvae behavior at 5, 15, 30, 40 and 60 min post-treatment. The L. muta muta venom and MC-1 also produced heart rate/rhythm alterations, circulation modifications, and the presence of thrombus and apoptotic phenomenon with pericardial damages. Acridine orange (100 μg/mL) was used to visualize apoptosis cellular process in control and treated whole embryos. The cardiotoxic alterations happened in more than 90% of all larvae under the action of L. muta muta venom and MC-1. The findings have demonstrated the potential cardiotoxicity by L. muta muta venom, suggesting the possibility of cardiovascular damages to patients after bushmaster envenoming.",

        "abstract": "I came across this book in its first iteration as an LLM thesis in the course of research I was conducting concerning the impact of mandatory minimum sentences on Indigenous women for a case in which I was acting as an expert witness. The case, R. v. Sharma, concerns Cheyenne Sharma, a young Cree woman from the Saugeen First Nation, surviving the structural, intergenerational, and racialized gendered effects of ongoing settler colonialism. She was charged and convicted of importing cocaine into Canada. Her “crime” was one of economic survival that befits the profile of Indigenous, Black, and racialized women charged with drug offences. Kaiser-Derrick’s research proved useful in showing the adverse effects of mandatory minimum sentences and the prohibition on conditional sentences for Indigenous women. Now revised and published in book form, Elspeth Kaiser-Derrick’s Implicating the System: Judicial Discourse in the Sentencing of Indigenous Women explores how criminalized Indigenous women’s histories appear in sentencing judgements. In this work, Kaiser-Derrick is particularly interested in the discourses that inform judicial reasoning and in how information presented through presentence reports (PSRs) and Gladue reports are translated into “what information the sentencing judge hears, and how this influences sanctions” (p. 3). Kaiser-Derrick amassed an impressive number of reported sentencing decisions concerning Indigenous women (175 in total) spanning the period from when Gladue was decided (April 1999) until December 2015. She observes that sentencing decisions, although filtered through legal and institutional constraints, are a crucial, if not sufficient, site to consider Indigenous women’s experiences of life and law. The range of Kaiser-Derrick’s engagement with individual sentencing decisions provides a critical contribution to how sentencing decisions incorporate gendered understandings of Indigenous women’s historical and ongoing victimization and criminalization. Central to the book is the notion that existing feminist literature on the victimization–criminalization continuum may be implicated in the crafting of sentences for Indigenous women. Leaning heavily on the work of Patricia Monture, Gillian Balfour, Dana DeHart, and others, the first chapter examines how the criminalization–victimization continuum accounts for the socio-economic reasons for Indigenous women’s encounters with the criminal justice system, and their particular gendered and racialized vulnerabilities and individual responses to sustained victimization. These experiences of victimization frequently occur in a sustained manner throughout their lives, often involving physical or sexual violence and exploitation, in addition to neglect and substance abuse. Kaiser-Derrick is cautious not to imply a deterministic view of victimization, insisting that “the continuum should be framed in terms of how (personal, collective and state-based) experiences of victimization are marginalizing and constrain the life options available to [Indigenous women], which",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThis study aims to verify the associations among sleep bruxism (SB), sleep arousal (SA), and concurrent body movements.\n\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\nSubjects underwent a standard overnight polysomnography test and audio-video recordings. Sleep quality was evaluated according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria, while SA was determined as per the American Sleep Disorders Association criteria. Analyses were performed by an external institution after masking of the subjects' information. SB was assessed based on the presence/absence of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes, which were identified by using electromyography of the masseter muscle. The observed simultaneous movements included lower leg movement (LLM), swallowing, face scratching, head movement, body movement, eye blinking, coughing, licking, sighing, body scratching, lip sucking, somniloquy, and yawning. The LLM was determined visually, as well as through an increase in the tibialis electromyogram signal. Other movements were visually assessed using audio-video recordings. The incidences of all the simultaneous movements were compared between RMMA with intercurrent SA (SAwRMMA; RMMA episode derived from a masseter electromyogram showing more than 10% of maximum voluntary contraction) and SA without RMMA (SAw/oRMMA).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFourteen subjects were included in this study (females/males: 4/10, mean age: 31.5 ± 5.7 years). Among these, LLM, swallowing, body movement, licking, body scratching, and lip sucking were frequently observed in SAwRMMA episodes than in SAw/oRMMA episodes, significantly. However, the non-specific simultaneous movements were higher observed in SAw/oRMMA episodes than that in SAwRMMA.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur results suggest that SB is concurrently activated with LLM in relation to arousal.",

        "abstract": "Although Deep Belief Network (DBN) has been applied to a wide range of practical scenarios, i.e. image classification, signal recognition, remaining useful life estimation, on account of its powerful high classification accuracy, but it has impossible interpretation of functionality (it is desirable to have a high level of interpretability for users also). In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy DBN system called TSK_DBN which combines DBN and TSK fuzzy system. Firstly, the fuzzy clustering algorithm FCM is used to divide the input space, and the membership function of the fuzzy rule is defined. Then, the implicit feature is created by DBN. Finally, the consequent parameters of the fuzzy rule are determined by LLM(Least Learning Machine). The TSK_DBN fuzzy system has an adaptive mechanism, which can automatically adjust the depth until the optimal accuracy is achieved. The prominent character of the TSK_DBN system is that there is adaptive mechanism to regulate the depth of DBN to get a high accuracy. Several benchmark datasets have been used to empirically evaluate the efficiency of the proposed TSK_DBN in handling pattern classification tasks. The results show that the accuracy rates of TSK_DBN are at least comparable (if not superior) to DBN system with distinctive ability in providing explicit knowledge in the form of high interpretable rule base.",

A novel data fusion scheme is proposed to merge the information from the different channels into a unique feature map in which potential defective regions will be highlighted distinctly. The distribution of the pixel values corresponding to the defect-free background texture in the feature map is modeled as per the Gumbel distribution model whose parameters are estimated by partitioning the feature map into a set of small patches. By calculating the log-likelihood value of each patch, a log-likelihood map (LLM) can be conveniently created, which provides a good cluster representation of the non-defective regions. A simple thresholding procedure then follows to discriminate between defective regions and homogeneous background in the LLM. The performance of the method has been extensively evaluated using a variety of real fabric samples, and the effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been verified by experimental results in comparison with other methods.",

        "abstract": "Lamb leg meat (LLM) was marinated using solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) concentrations (0.04 g/g) for 15 min under high pressure (HP) treatment (100–400 MPa, 25°C) to investigate meat characteristics, volatile components and microstructure. HP treatment increased process yields during marinating, especially at 200 MPa, the shearing force and hardness reached their minimum value, which indicated that HP treatment (200 MPa) can effectively improve the tenderness of LLM. The electron microscopy revealed that HP modified the myofibrillar structure in the leg muscles. With the rise of pressure, the lightness (L*) value increased significantly. The red/green hue (a*) reached the maximum value at 200 MPa. HP influenced the formation of some key volatile compounds in LLM. LLM pressurized at 200–400 MPa had lower levels of furfural than control group, LLM pressurized at 200 MPa had higher levels of N‐nonanal and N‐octanal, lower levels of palmitic acid, but oleic acid and stearic acid was not detected. Only at 200–400 MPa, 2,3‐octanedione and 2‐octanone were detected in HP‐treated LLM. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: High‐pressure (HP) is an effective technology as a pretreatment to postslaughter meat. Advantages include opportunities to improve tenderness and other characteristics of processed meat products by appropriate use of this technique. This study showed that application of high‐pressure premarinated treatment (200 MPa, 15 min, 25°C and 0.04 g/g salt content) could effectively improve the muscle fiber structure of lamb leg, several major volatile substances and tenderness. This work verifies the potential of HP for improving LLM characteristics and volatile components. These results can be beneficial for the applications of pressurized mutton in the mutton industry.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper we examine the geographic patterns of employment growth and employment polarization in small and medium-sized cities (SMCs) in Denmark during the rise of the new economy. The geography of employment polarization in Danish cities is examined using register-based employment data on occupations and wages divided into the public and private sectors in the period 1993–2006; it therefore covers a long period of transformation and growth in the Danish economy. We conclude that employment growth is characterized by employment polarization combined with growth in low- and high-wage employment and a decline in medium-wage employment. However, these patterns of polarization differ across the public and private sectors, as well as by geography. While local labour market (LLM) size, city position and city specialization influence the geography of private-sector employment growth and polarization, municipal population and composition influence the geography of public-sector growth patterns across wage levels. Finally, public and private employment are positively associated within SMCs, predominantly driven by the positive association between public employment and private-sector low-wage employment. However, public employment is not associated with an increase in private low-wage employment in more remote areas.",

In this paper, compared with the unaging explosive, each aging explosive sample’s terahertz time-domain spectra were obtained and the terahertz absorption spectra were calculated by using Fourier transform and Lambert’s law. The results show that there are several terahertz absorption peaks which were called “fingerprint spectra” for different aging explosive samples in the range of 0.3–6.0 THz spectrum. Meanwhile, the results also show that the locations of the characteristic absorption peaks are not the same. Moreover, the unaging and aging explosive samples have obviously different terahertz absorption spectra.",

        "title": "The Patentability of Genetic Therapies: CAR-T and Medical Treatment Exclusions Around The World",
        "abstract": "More than eighty countries, including the members of the European Patent Convention, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, China, Japan, and India, currently exclude or limit the patentability of methods of medical treatment. CAR-T and other recent gene and cell therapies, which operate based on the extraction of genetic or cellular material from a patient, the alteration of such material, and the reintroduction of such material to the patient’s body, should, under most or all of these legal regimes, be considered medical treatments that are thus excluded from patentability, or as to which patent enforcement is limited. Accordingly, we urge national patent offices to update their examination procedures and practices to take these patentability limitations into account, and to publish guidance clearly explaining this approach to applicants. 1* Pontificia Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra (LLB), Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences (FLACSO, LLM), Ph.D. candidate, University of Buenos Aires; research associate, Knowledge Ecology International (KEI). ** Harvard Law School (JD), Rice University (BSEE, BA), Professor, University of Utah S.J.

        "abstract": "\n Background:\n Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) is characterized by very premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to profoundly elevated levels of LDL-C. Attempts to lower LDL-C in patients with HoFH often require multiple lipid-lowering medications (LLMs). Evinacumab, an angiopoietin-like protein 3 inhibitor, has been shown to reduce LDL-C in patients with HoFH by approximately 50% when added to maximally tolerated background LLMs.\n \n \n Objective:\n In this post-hoc analysis we assessed efficacy of evinacumab in patients with HoFH according to background LLM type.\n \n \n Methods:\n This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 24-week phase 3 trial (NCT03399786) that randomized patients 2:1 to receive intravenous (IV) evinacumab 15 mg/kg (n=43) or IV placebo (n=22) every 4 weeks. The effect of background LLMs on the efficacy of evinacumab to lower LDL-C was assessed for the following subgroups: high intensity-statin, low-intensity statins, lomitapide, triple therapy (ezetimibe + PCSK9 inhibitor + statin), and quadruple therapy (triple therapy + lomitapide). Primary endpoint was % LDL-C reduction from baseline to week 24.\n \n \n Results:\n At baseline, 55.4% (evinacumab, 58.1%; placebo, 50.0%) of HoFH patients were on triple therapy. Overall, 93.8% were on statins (76.9% on high intensity statins). Across LLM subgroups, mean baseline LDL-C levels ranged from 166.8 mg/dL to 281.8 mg/dL (Table). From baseline to week 24, marked reductions in LDL-C occurred with evinacumab treatment, which were observed in all groups: quadruple therapy (66.8%), triple therapy (56.0%), lomitapide (49.6%), high-intensity statins (48.6%) and low-intensity statins (41.0%). Evinacumab was generally well-tolerated.\n \n \n Conclusions:\n Evinacumab substantially lowers LDL-C levels in patients with HoFH irrespective of background LLM.\n \n \n \n",

This study investigated the performance of LLM in detecting differential item functioning (DIF) for polytomously scored items via simulations where various sample sizes, ability mean differences (impact), and DIF types were manipulated. Also, the performance of LLM was compared with that of other observed score–based DIF methods, namely ordinal logistic regression, logistic discriminant function analysis, Mantel, and generalized Mantel-Haenszel, regarding their Type I error (rejection rates) and power (DIF detection rates). For the observed score matching stratification in LLM, 5 and 10 strata were used. Overall, generalized Mantel-Haenszel and LLM with 10 strata showed better performance than other methods, whereas ordinal logistic regression and Mantel showed poor performance in detecting balanced DIF where the DIF direction is opposite in the two pairs of categories and partial DIF where DIF exists only in some of the categories.",

        "title": "Sticky Floors, Springboards, Stairways & Slow Escalators: Mobility Pathways and Preferences of International Students in U.S. Law Schools",
        "abstract": "This article addresses the participation of international students in US law schools. Historically, international students congregated in U.S. law school graduate programs such as the LLM; while graduate degree programs still account for the largest segment of international students studying law in the United States, there has been a concurrent rise in the number of international students who pursue a more mainstream U.S. law degree and choose the JD. In fact, in recent research we highlight that while certainly not a seamless assimilation, the percentage of international students in mainstream JD programs not only has increased substantially in the last decade but also has surpassed other domestic minority groups in certain instances. In tracing these students and their mobility contexts, this Article makes three main contributions. First, it maps the changing demographics of international student participation in U.S. law schools and explores the factors shaping students’ preferences, including the relative importance of access to training opportunities, language, immigration status, prior work experience, and lawyer regulation and licensing (at home and abroad). In doing so, we highlight, following earlier work, the importance of local contexts in shaping students’ trajectories and the changes in these trends, especially with regard to what we term the “big Asia story.” Second, this Article offers a set of four metaphorical categories to help think about these empirical processes: sticky floors, springboards, stairways and slow escalators. Using each of these broad categories, we suggest that students find different sources of persuasion and pushback as they navigate their respective paths within law schools. Students’ decisions are molded at different stages by different actors and institutional constraints, with ultimate choices (and, therefore, tracks) reflecting a range of interactions between each of these constraints and capacities. Finally, the pathways provide a framework for theorizing about malleable social capital and recursive transnational theory. While global legal education is not technically a transnational legal order, the framework aids in thinking through the implications of these mapped paths and trends and the important perspective international students can offer to reveal the ways in which local and global actors emerge and intersect.",

Dieses Prinzip machen sich Zugvogel im Formationsflug zunutze. Fur Piloten ist der manuelle Formationsflug im treibstoffsparenden Optimalpunkt zu arbeitintensiv. Diese Aufgabe muss ein Flugregler ubernehmen. Die Auslegung eines solchen Formationsflugreglers erfordert ein Wirbelschleppensimulationsmodell, welches die von der Wirbelschleppe induzierten Windfelder berechnet. In diesem Beitrag werden zwei verschiedene Wirbelschleppensimulationsmodelle fur das Szenario eines stationaren Horizontalflugs verglichen und anhand des Ergebnisses des etablierten Stangenwirbelmodells beurteilt. Die zu vergleichenden Simulationsmodelle nutzen einerseits die Prandtlsche Traglinientheorie (engl.: Lifting Line Method, LLM) und andererseits eine instationare Wirbelgittermethode (engl.: Vortex Lattice Method, VLM). Beide Methoden basieren auf der Lagrangeschen Betrachtungsweise der Bewegung von Fluidteilchen, bei der einzelne Fluidteilchen an vordefinierten Tragflachenpositionen in die Nachlaufstromung ubergeben werden und sich dort frei bewegen konnen. Die Bewegung der Fluidteilchen im Nachlauf fuhrt zur Bildung von Streichlinien. Die Streichlinien werden durch abschnittsweise gerade Wirbelfilamente approximiert. Die Wirbelstarke der Wirbelschleppe wird durch Zirkulationswerte der Wirbelfilamente diskretisiert. Aus den Lage der Wirbelfilamente und ihrer Zirkulation kann das Windfeld der Wirbelschleppe berechnet werden. Die LLM-Simulation basiert auf starker vereinfachten Annahmen als die VLM. Die Gegenuberstellung beider Modelle leistet einen Beitrag, Modellierungsfehler zu untersuchen, welche durch diese Vereinfachungen entstehen konnen. Der Vergleich zeigt auch, dass die Ergebnisse beider Berechnungsmethoden in Bezug auf die Wirbelfilamentpositionen und Windfelder bei identischen Parametern ahnlich sind. Die in der LLM umgesetzten Vereinfachungen fuhren zu einer mit der VLM vergleichbaren Wirbelschleppenberechnung im Falle eines stationaren Horizontalfluges. Die Abhangigkeit der Verfahren von ihren Parametern und die Konvergenz hin zu feineren Parametern wird untersucht. Daraus werden Empfehlungen fur Parameterwerte abgeleitet.",

        "abstract": "We explore the response of the insensitive high explosive (IHE) 1,3,5-Triamino-2,4,6- trinitrobenzene (TATB) under detonation-induced shock conditions using in-situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction in the 100 ns time scale using either a conventional or a colliding detonation drive. In all of the detonation experiments on various sizes and morphologies of TATB, we observe an extended stability of the TATB triclinic crystal structure. As the detonation front passes through the TATB, X-ray diffraction indicates a portion of the TATB exhibits a compression up to 30+ GPa, followed subsequently by a pressure release and continued decomposition over a few hundred nanoseconds. Likewise, for colliding detonation-driven shock compression of single crystals of TATB, a significant portion of the triclinic crystal structure appears to be stable up to 60+ GPa. Conversely, in similar detonations of a LLM-105 PBX, X-ray diffraction is simply indicative of decomposition without the apparent compression and slow decomposition seen in TATB. The results indicate the surprising resilience of TATB under these high-pressure, temperature and shock conditions, providing a baseline for understanding the insensitivity of TATB that is considered the industry standard for an insensitive high explosive. The results also provide intriguing information for the extended reaction zone in TATB, and the hot-spot mechanisms for initiating and propagating detonation in this uniquely insensitive explosive.",

        "title": "Labor mobility effects of a firm-level shock",
        "abstract": "Most governments tackle the economic issues of underdeveloped areas by offering subsidies aimed at fostering economic activities and local employment. Localized policies put constraints on where businesses may locate in order to receive subsidies, but they generally impose few restrictions on whom subsidized businesses must hire. Therefore, the positive impact of place-based policies on employment depends, among others, on two specific factors: the ability to attract new jobs from within the destination local labor market (LLM) as well as that the new job places are not subtracted from existing non-subsidized businesses in the same area. Using administrative data on firms and workers in Italy, we adopt a multiple regression discontinuity design to empirically assess the employment effect of substantial incentives for the replacement or establishment of new capital. Our empirical strategy allows identifying where new hires come from (from the same LLM, a neighboring LLM or a far-away LLM), from which pool of individuals (those working for another company, the students or the inactives), and the impact on wages. The results show how the majority of recruits come from new entrants to the labor market, in particular, young people and students, while displacement effects are limited. Besides, subsidized companies tend to keep their most valuable staff and hire more qualified young people by offering higher wages. So, fears concerning the spatial dispersion of the effects or the possibility that financed companies might poach (skilled) workers from non-subsidized firms in the LLM, at least in areas suffering from high unemployment, appear excessive.",

This primary research revealing that there are two groups of non-believers about the impacts of cultural issues in the context of international arbitration. Additionally, a brief history and analysis of the formation of international arbitration and its relations to the current social cultural issues. Research shows that some arbitrators deny Cultural Difference Issues (CDI) or act as if public or private international law in the cases exist in a vacuum. There is evidence of cases where arbitrators ignore that CDI have significant impacts in the outcome of international arbitration. Furthermore, some international arbitrators believe that the only cultural differences are differences between the legal systems and technical understanding, denying the existence of CDI in the context of international arbitration; and yet, evidence shows culture affects a person’s world view, understanding of law, business norms, emotions and expectations.

PhD Scholar, Department of Political Sciences, University of Peshawar, Peshawar, KP, Pakistan PAPER INFO ABSTRACT Received: July 21, 2020 Accepted: September 05, 2020 Online: September 30, 2020 Borders and borderlands concept was found from the very beginning of human society. In early period of time borders demarcation was physical like rivers, mountains, forest etc but with passage of time it converted to lines. The study throws light on those historical events that played great role in the formation of borders. The paper scrutinize the policies of Colonial powers in the borderlands of Asia and Africa where they were completely ignorant from the nature of these societies who lived over borderland and their policies of utilizing these colonies as raw material for theirindustrialization. The decisive treaties of Westphalia and Paris accord has been discussed as main event that played role in the formation of borders. The emergence of nation states and increasing of borders has been highlighted. The paper concludes that borders and borderlands possessed great importance in the state politics and world political scenario as they are the main source of connection between people, societies, culture, civilizations of the states. The prevention of crimes, smuggling and illegal movement of goods and people could be controlled by effective border management control.",

However, due the restriction of the stability and computational cost in solving challenging problem, Diagonally Implicit Multistage Integration Methods (DIMSIMs) was introduced that takes the combinations of RK and LLM methods. The research studies the extrapolation of DIMSIMs for solving the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) particularly nonstiff problems. Main idea of the research is to implement extrapolation technique for special case of DIMSIMs with the conditions of stage order equal to the order. Extrapolation is applied by considering the stability of the base method with stepsize h and h/2. The numerical results for Van der Pol and Euler equations showed the efficiencies of extrapolation to these methods which therefore opens the door to extend the research for higher order DIMSIMs.",

The upper limb muscle mass (ULM), lower limb muscle mass (LLM) and trunk muscle mass (TM) were divided by body weight (Wt) and their relationships with the homeostasis model assessment – insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were investigated. [Results] HOMA-IR showed significant negative correlations with ULM/Wt, LLM/Wt, and TM/Wt in all patients and the obese group. However, there was no significant correlation with ULM/Wt in the non-obese group. The area under curve (AUC) cut-off values for HOMA-IR of LLM/Wt and TM/Wt were higher than that of ULM/Wt. [Conclusion] The finding suggests that LLM/Wt or TM/Wt are indicators of insulin resistance in male patients with type 2 diabetes.",

Treatment of type Baortic dissection typically consists of medical therapy in the uncomplicated cases, with surgical therapy reserved for complicated aortic dissection. Surgical therapy has shifted from traditional open surgical intervention to less invasive endovascular surgical interventions as a first line option. Complicated aortic dissection often presents as visceral or lower limb malperfusion (LLM). Conventional therapy of complicated aortic dissection has been revascularization of the affected vascular bed. Recently, numerous clinical trials and retrospective series have shown that treatment of the proximal aortic entry tear combined with targeted revascularization of the ischemic vascular bed leads to improved short term and long-term patient outcomes.

Four formulas of complete pellet with different level of LLM were tested (0%, 5%, 10% and 15%). The crude proteins of the diets were 17.7-18.1% and energy of the diets was 2,277-2,542 kcal/kg. The feed ingredients of the pellets consisted of corn, pollard, Pennisetum purpureum cv. Mott, molasses, soybean meal, LLM, copra cake, tapioca flour, and premix. The data measured were physical quality (hardness and durability), and chemical quality (dry matter, crude protein, crude fiber, extract ether, and ash). Data were analyzed based on a completely randomized design. The results showed that crude fiber and hardness of pellet were significant (P<0.01) between the treatments. The pellets with 15% LLM results highest of crude fiber and highest of pellet hardness. It is concluded that LLM can partially replace soyabean meal even at 15% without reducing the physical and chemical quality of the pellets.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: Lipid laden macrophages (LLM) from lung bronchoscopies have been identified as characteristic for some patients with e-cigarette (e-cig) or vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI). While vaping with THC oils containing vitamin E acetate is thought to have caused the outbreak, there is a subset of the EVALI cases who reported vaping only with nicotine-containing e-cigs. A recent animal study showed that propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin altered lipid homeostasis and induced LLM. In addition to the associations with EVALI, understanding the health effects of vaping with e-cigs in general needs additional investigation. Objective: We examined alterations in alveolar lipid homeostasis comparing e-cig users to cigarette smokers and never-smokers. Further, we determined the association of LLM with inflammatory cytokines. Methods: LLMs, inflammatory cell counts, and cytokines were determined in bronchial alveolar fluids (BAL) from a cross-sectional study of 62 volunteer subjects, age 21-45. Participants who were e-cig users were either never-smokers or former smokers. Cigarette smoking and e-cig use were confirmed by biomarkers of exposure, including lung and urine cotinine and 3-hydroxycotinine and urine anatabine, nicotelline, and PG. Results: High LLM counts were found in the lungs of almost all smokers and about half of the e-cig users, but not in any never-smokers (P 0.05). LLMs were not related to THC exposure. Discussion: This is the first report comparing LLMs in the lungs of e-cig users with smokers and never-smokers. LLMs were found in lungs of both smokers and a portion of e-cig users. Given their presence among smokers, they are not likely to be useful as a marker identifying those with EVALI. However, LLMs may be one of the markers for specific disease risks associated with e-cig usage, but not smoking. Citation Format: Min-Ae Song, Peter G. Shields, Jo L. Freudenheim, Theodore M.

Kata Kunci: Perluasan Makna, Prinsip Nondiskriminasi, Cuti Isteri Melahirkan Abstract This research is aimed to analyse the difference of setting the scheme of leave granted for male workers during their wives’ maternity period for civil servants and private companies’ employees. The different regulations in both groups of employment are related with extended definition of the principle of non-discrimination concerning the right to take leave for the male workers due to maternity period of their wives. This research employed normative juridical method, statute and comparative approaches. Primary and secondary materials obtained for this research were further analysed by means of systematic and analytical interpretation, and legal construction analysis. The research result learns that the extended definition of non-discrimination principle is based on the book of practical guidelines for employers to promote and avoid discrimination at workplace in Indonesia. This book is published by ILO in association with APINDO. This book of guidelines has served as the source of legal materials that are capable of setting guidelines for both the government and employers in terms of giving protection to workers based on the principle of non-discrimination, especially the protection given to male workers during their wives’ maternity period. In reference to the extended definition of non-discrimination principle, the difference in the regulations regarding this case between those in government offices and private companies is still seen as discrimination in a legal scope.

The first bill of its kind, AB474 limits healthcare providers’ ability to prescribe not only opioids, but all controlled substances. Advocates of AB474 state that the bill is key to reducing the number of opioid-related deaths in Nevada. Others state that the mandates in the bill restrict healthcare providers to such a degree that many patients with pain will no longer be treated effectively. This study aims to identify the specific trend of opioid prescribing patterns of Nevada physicians (both allopathic and osteopathic) by specialty and location in response to the implementation of AB474. Using data obtained from the Nevada State Board of Pharmacy, a retrospective analysis of total opioid prescriptions and dosage was performed. De-identified physician data from 2013-2018 was grouped by specialty and county (i.e., pediatricians, Clark county). Special care was taken to preserve physician privacy; as such, all counties other than Clark and Washoe were grouped as “Rural.” The study details changes in Nevada physicians’ prescribing patterns in reaction to the new controlled substance prescribing statutes. Some specialties seem to be inordinately impacted, raising both questions concerning adequate access to pain treating medications and questions regarding previous overprescribing patterns. Further research must be accomplished to elucidate the benefits, or harm, to patients by the unprecedented, restrictive mandates promulgated. Specifically, changes in prevalence of prescription opioids vs. illicit opioid-related deaths, and analysis of the effects of restricting non-opioid controlled substances in addressing Nevada’s opioid epidemic should be investigated. 2020 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2020, VOL. 40, NO.

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the growth performances and carcass characteristics of male New Zealand White rabbits, offered complete feed pellets containing different levels of leucaena leaf meal (LLM). Twenty rabbits (2.0-2.5 months old, 600-1000 g of weight) were divided into four groups, and fed pelleted diets containing 0% LLM (P0), 5% LLM (P1), 10% LLM (P2) and 15% LLM (P3). The feeding trial lasted 10 weeks. The crude proteins (CP) of the diets were 17.7-18.1% and energy ranged 2,277-2,542 kcal/kg. The feed ingredient of the pellets consisted of corn, pollard, Pennisetum purpureum cv. Mott, molasses, soybean meal, LLM, copra cake, tapioca flour, and premix. Feed was offered twice daily and water given ad libitum. After 10 weeks they were slaughtered and slaughter weight (SW), carcass and non-carcass percentage, and meat bone ratio (MBR) were determined. Data were analyzed based on a completely randomized design. The SW (2.23 ± 0.24 kg), carcass percentage (48.01 ± 5.41%), non-carcass percentage (51.99 ± 5.41%), and MBR (2.74 ± 0.53) were highest (P<0.05) in rabbits fed 10% LLM compared to those fed the other diets. It was concluded that inclusion of LLM at 10% level resulted in the highest slaughter weight, carcass percentage, non-carcass percentage and meat bone ration compared to the other treatments. Inclusion level higher than 10% resulted in a reduction in these parameters but not significantly different from that of the controls.",

        "title": "Fuzzy Modeling using Vector Quantization and Local Linear Mapping",
        "abstract": "—Fuzzy modeling has been extensively studied. It has been shown that fuzzy modeling using vector quantization (VQ) and steepest descent method (SDM) is effective in terms of the number of rules (parameters). In the methods, the initial parameters of fuzzy rules by using VQ with learning data ﬁrstly are determined, then the parameters are adjusted by using SDM. On the other hand, Neural Gas (NG) is known as a novel approach of VQ and NG with local linear mapping (LLM) has been applied to a time-series prediction problem. In the application, the predicted value in each of subregions is approximated by using a corresponding linear mapping. It has been demonstrated that, compared with RBF, NG with LLM is advantageous in terms of the accuracy and the number of rules. The idea of NG with LLM has been applied to fuzzy modeling with TS fuzzy model, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. However, the effectiveness of this approach has not been been conﬁrmed for simpler fuzzy model such as simpliﬁed fuzzy model. In this paper, the method using NG with LLM to fuzzy modeling with simpliﬁed fuzzy inference model is proposed and the similar method using k-means instead of NG is also proposed. In the proposed methods, the initial parameters of fuzzy rules including the weights in the consequent part by using NG (k-means) are ﬁrstly deﬁned, and then the parameters by using SDM are adjusted. The effectiveness of the proposed methods with simpliﬁed fuzzy modeling is demonstrated in numerical simulations of function approximation and classiﬁcation problems.",

        "title": "Integrating Large Language Models for Automated Test Case Generation in Complex",
        "abstract": "When software systems are larger, complex and mature, the quality assurance process gets difficult. Test case generation in a conventional manner, often manually, is a time and resource-intensive process that fails to cope with the fast cycles that modern dynamic development environments push. In this paper a novel technique to automatically generate test cases based on the new state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) is being proposed. LLMs, an application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, provide immense benefits such as the ability to analyze unstructured data for e.g., system documentation, user stories, and historical test data to automatically generate test cases. Integrating LLMs into the test automation pipeline can result in increased test coverage, decreased manual overhead, and enhanced system stability to the organization. Conventional approaches are contrasted with LLM-centric methodologies, to provide a detailed sequential approach to integrating LLMs, and highlight challenges and limitations with respect to the practical adoption of LLMs for testing. This paper provides directions for future research in this fast-growing area.",

        "abstract": "This dissertation was written as part of the LLM in Transnational and European Commercial Law, Banking Law, Arbitration/Mediation at the International Hellenic University. The present thesis deals with the conflict between two fundamental rights of immense importance within the European Union, namely the right to the protection of personal data that derives from the vital right to privacy, against the right to freedom of expression. It begins with a brief description of the need for the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation in the new modern era we live in, which is characterized by constant technological developments. An explanatory summary of “Privacy” and “Data Protection” and their safeguarding as two distinguished values will follow. Moreover, since this thesis will mainly focus on the conflict between the right to the protection of personal data and the right to freedom of expression, at the next stage the paper analyzes the concept of data protection and the basic notions, which the reader should be aware of for being able to understand this paper. Thereafter, the notion of freedom of expression and its notorious necessity in society shall be approached. Consequently, this thesis will investigate the different cases in which various European Courts have dealt with the conflict of the above rights and how they have set the priority of those to reach a fair balancing among them. Finally, it describes the interconnection of the abovementioned for reaching a comprehensive conclusion. Antigoni Georgiou 11/12/2019",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT As acute alcohol intake can trigger suicidal ideas and attempts in people already at risk, and self-aggression is more intense after alcohol consumption, the aim of this study is to assess the relationship between blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and the lethality of suicide methods. A number of different socio-demographic and clinical predictors related to selection of high lethality methods were evaluated. This retrospective autopsy study covers an 11-year period of autopsies performed in the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Belgrade. It included 308 subjects with confirmed BAC above 0‰ who committed suicide. The suicide methods were dichotomized in terms of lethality – low lethality methods (LLM – drug/chemical overdose or use of a sharp object, n = 20) and high lethality methods (HLM – hanging, firearms and explosives, drowning, jumping from a height and immolation, n = 288). Our study did not reveal a statistically significant relationship between alcohol concentration and HLM. There is an obvious trend of HLM in rising BAC categories, but without any statistical significance. Of all tested predictors, only the male gender has significant correlation with HLM (p = 0.036). Despite the absence of correlation between BAC and HLM, the rising trend in BAC in our study showed, along with opposing literature data, that we can conclude this interconnection is highly complex.",

The possibility of bringing lawsuit for damages is perhaps the most significant manifestation of competition law’s private enforcement. In the European Union, compensation for victims of violations of anticompetitive provisions has recently been provided by Directive 104/2014. According to the provisions of EU law, the compensation is the total amount of damage suffered by the injured, both direct and indirect purchasers have the right to institute the action, and there is no provision for class actions.On the other hand, in US federal law, the right to compensation has been provided by the Sherman Act since 1890. The Clayton Law, which amended the Sherman Act, provides that compensation is three times the damage suffered by the injured. Further, according to the case law of the US Supreme Court, only direct purchasers have the right to file such lawsuits, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for class actions. The comparative study aiming at the clearest and the global understanding of the relevant \nlegal issues and institutions in the EU, its member states and in the USA, is tantamount to the originality of this dissertation.",

        "abstract": "Objective: This study aims to verify the associations among sleep bruxism (SB), sleep arousal (SA), and concurrent body movements. Material and Methods: Subjects underwent a standard overnight polysomnography test and audio-video recordings. Sleep quality was evaluated according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales criteria, while SA was determined as per the American Sleep Disorders Association criteria. Analyses were performed by an external institution after masking of the subjects’ information. SB was assessed based on the presence/absence of rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes, which were identified by using electromyography of the masseter muscle. The observed simultaneous movements included lower leg movement (LLM), swallowing, face scratching, head movement, body movement, eye blinking, coughing, licking, sighing, body scratching, lip sucking, somniloquy, and yawning. The LLM was determined visually, as well as through an increase in the tibialis electromyogram signal. Other movements were visually assessed using audio-video recordings. The incidences of all the simultaneous movements were compared between RMMA with intercurrent SA (SAwRMMA; RMMA episode derived from a masseter electromyogram showing more than 10% of maximum voluntary contraction) and SA without RMMA (SAw/oRMMA). Results: Fourteen subjects were included in this study (females/males: 4/10, mean age: 31.5 ± 5.7 years). Among these, LLM, swallowing, body movement, licking, body scratching, and lip sucking were frequently observed in SAwRMMA episodes than in SAw/oRMMA episodes, significantly. However, the non-specific simultaneous movements were higher observed in SAw/oRMMA episodes than that in SAwRMMA. Conclusion: Our results suggest that SB is concurrently activated with LLM in relation to arousal.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The venom of Crotalus ornatus (vCo) poses a threat to human health, as it contains a mixture of toxins that can cause cytotoxic, necrotic, and hemolytic effects. The present study assessed methanolic and acetone extracts from leaves and flowers of Larrea tridentata, as well as the bark of Quercus virginiana as potential suppressors of the toxic effects of vCo in vitro. The content of total phenols, flavonoids, and tannins of the plant extracts were quantified for the suppression of vCo cytotoxicity in two cell culture models, human lymphocytes and porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells. Extracts from Q. virginiana displayed a greater concentration of total phenols, flavonoids, and tannins. Co-incubation of lymphocytes and PAE cells with fixed concentrations of vCo and plant extracts resulted in decreased vCo-induced cytotoxicity. A 24-hour co-incubation of lymphocytes with vCo (2.36 ± 0.17 µg/mL) and 0.5 µg/mL of methanolic leaf extract from L. tridentata (LLM) significantly suppressed the venom-induced cytotoxicity by 37.33 ± 8.33%. Similarly, the LLM extract (4 µg/mL) caused a significant decrease in vCo cytotoxicity after 24 hours in PAE cells. In contrast, while the acetone extract of Q. virginiana bark (QA) suppressed cytotoxicity by 29.20 ± 3.51% (p < 0.001) in lymphocytes, it failed to protect PAE cells against vCo after 24 hours. In PAE cells, a shorter 4-hour co-incubation showed significant suppression of cytotoxicity with both extracts. Our results collectively suggest that LLM and QA possess cytoprotective properties against the in vitro toxic effects of vCo, and thus establish extracts from these plants as potential therapeutic interventions against Crotalus envenomation.",

        "abstract": "Although international students have been routinely admitted to U.S. law schools over the last few decades, there is little known about this demographic outside of specific programs aimed to admit these students like the LLM or the SJD. This Chapter extends this literature to focus on a rising trend of students within more the “mainstream” law school program, the JD. Our past research shows that the proportion of JDs who are international students has increased over the last decade, with the increase being most notable at elite law schools. Still, little is known about the experience of these students. In this Chapter, drawing from interview data with approximately 50 international students, as well as supplemental data from law school faculty and administrators, we suggest, in line with other research, that language is crucial to framing these students’ experiences. However, we do not limit our analysis to direct language proficiency. Instead, we argue that beyond technical language markers like vocabulary and syntax, it is the culture of language that determines the quality of students’ interactions and their institutional choices. International students, like all students, are constantly engaging in interactions that determine their perceived “fit” within sites in which they are embedded (e.g. classrooms, student groups, study groups, etc.) and across these contexts, expectations and presumptions of their abilities and identities shape the ways in which they are treated and allowed to assimilate. In concentrating on language and its interaction with students’ lived experience, these data give us important insights into understanding the creation and experience of law school cultures and their systemic reproduction of hierarchy.",

Bitonte, MD, MA, JD, LLM, FCLM, City of Los Angeles Commission on Disability, Los Angeles, CA; Email rbitonte@aol.com Michelle Gutierrez Harris, MHS, San Diego, CA; Email michelleann.gutierrez@gmail.com Over the past several years much interest has been aroused by the number of opioid related deaths. In California this has led to the implementation and enforced usage of the CURES (California Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System) database. The desire to curb opioid abuse has led to a recent initiation of the California Death Certificate Program. This program identifies physicians, dentists, and other providers who have prescribed opiates to an individual within 3 years of that person being identified as having died due to an opioid related overdose. The identified prescriber is then referred to that prescriber’s overseeing regulatory board, such a Medical Board of California or the Dental Board of California, for further investigation and possible disciplinary action. Any referral to a regulatory board necessitates an investigation. These investigations often are expensive, distracting, embarrassing, and potentially harmful to a professional’s reputation and practice. We propose that there be an intermediary process before these identified prescribers are referred to their respective regulatory boards for investigations. For example, implicated professional individuals could be referred to their County Medical Associations for review by their professional peers. If questionable, or unethical, behavior is determined to have occurred, then these professional individuals can then be referred to their respective regulatory bodies for investigation. 2020 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2020, VOL. 40, NO.

Bitonte, MD, MA, JD, LLM, LLM, SJD candidate, Case Western Reserve University School of Law, Cleveland, OH; Email – rbitonte@aol.com Electrosmog is an umbrella term used to describe the exposure of combinations of high and low frequency electric fields, magnetic fields, and electromagnetic exposure in varying patterns, intensities, and environments at differing amounts of time. The desire for faster speeds and bandwidth has spurred continual technological improvements with its increased widespread use and exposure of the population to cellphones, cellphone LTE/5G towers, computers, laptops, notebooks, wireless networks/LANs, and other similarly daily used devices. Research has shown that exposure to electrosmog radiation has an effect on the blood, heart and the autonomic nervous system in humans in which heart palpitations induce pain or pressure in the chest accompanied by anxiety can cause autoimmune diseases and electromagnetic hypersensitivity in mice; and also has been shown to trigger sleep problems, headaches, nervousness, fatigue, and difficulty concentrating in humans. There are a multitude of other health issues such as leukemia, brain tumors, breast cancer that some investigators suspect a correlational link between these underlying health conditions and electrosmog. Conducting research in trying to prove detrimental effects of electrosmog can be difficult in a controlled setting, especially when it is so abundant in our environment. Very little is actually publicized about the known potential harmful effects of electromagnetic field radiation on human health. This can be a major issue for physicians confronting health conditions without an identifiable cause. In fact, there is considerable debate about the severity and consequences on human health caused by electrosmog. The effects of electrosmog are largely unknown and, if detrimental, need to be considered like any other hazardous toxin, such as asbestos and lead, in our environment. This necessitates more governmental research, particularly by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission regarding electrosmog indoors and outdoors, particularly with the set up of 5G cell phone towers in certain areas, and the effect of wireless networks. In order to enact federal, state, and local legislation, as well as regulations, that sensibly 2020 American College of Legal Medicine JOURNAL OF LEGAL MEDICINE 2020, VOL. 40, NO.

        "abstract": "Fluid–structure analysis is frequently used to design offshore structures in a large range of engineering applications. In order to install wind turbines from the seashore, it is required that its towers must be attached at the sea floor or a system needs to be developed that allows the turbine to float. Therefore, the objective of this work is to develop a coupled structural finite element analysis using localized Lagrange multipliers (LLM) at idealized monopile wind turbines. This method enables us to model large structures like wind turbine towers submerged in the ocean and determine the influence of the fluid–structure interaction on the dynamic structural response of these equipments. In this work, the mixed formulation [Formula: see text] developed takes into account the condition of irrotationality of the acoustic fluid. The classical LLM method is modified, thus, a new mixed-formulation for the interface frame has fluid pressure and solid displacement as degree of freedom. In other words, a coupling frame is introduced as fictitious porous material with the aim of non-symmetrical coupling between elastic solid and potential fluid. The solution to the non-matching meshes domain problem is also achieved with this methodology by several numerical strategies. The equations of solid and fluid domains are obtained by classical finite element method and their interaction is modeled with Localized Lagrange Multipliers. The solutions of numerical equations are obtained by direct form in a monolithic approach. The new modeling by using a porous material interface frame algorithm is verified through examples.",

        "abstract": "As a metropolitan city, Medan has several advantages that support the trading activities. However, these advantages must be underpinned by legal certainty in conducting trade transactions. Measuring instruments serves as the prominent equipment in building mutual trust in business relationships. The instruments are regulated in Law Number 2 of 1981 concerning Legal Metrology (LLM). This study is legal research using a normative legal method. The data were collected from literature and were analyzed qualitatively. The results reveal several problems in the administration of legal metrology. Limited budget, lack of calibration officers, lack of support from local policies in the implementation of services, and insufficient facilities and infrastructure are the current circumstances in almost all regions including Medan. Such condition occurs because of the incomplete issues of competency in the field of legal metrology between the central and local governments after regional autonomy implementation. In conclusion, the overlapping authority between the central and local government resulted in a non-optimal administration of legal metrology in the regions. A synergy between the centralized LLM and decentralized Law Number 32 of 2014 concerning Local Government is needed. Thus protection will be achieved in the application of legal metrology services.",

An X-bridge-C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm × 3.5 µ) with mobile phases containing a Potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate anhydrous buffer and methanol in the ratio of (90:10 v/v) and (35:65 v/v) are used for the estimation of LLM and its degradation products. The flow rate of 0.8 mL/min is maintained and all degradation studies are performed at 210 nm using photodiode array (PDA) detector. Method Validation is carried out according to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines and the parameters namely; precision, accuracy, specificity, stability, robustness, linearity, limit of quantitation (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) are evaluated. The present developed RP-HPLC method shows the purity angle of peaks is less than their threshold angle, signifying that it to be suitable for stability studies. Hence, the developed method can be used for the successful separation of LLM and its impurities in the pharmaceutical dosage formulations.",

Closed populations, heterogeneity of inclusion probabilities and dependence between lists are taken into consideration in this work. The main objective is to propose a new parameterization for the Poisson log linear odel (LLM) to treat continuous covariates in their original measurement scale. The analytic estimate of the confidence bounds of the hidden population is also provided. Proposed model was applied to simulated and real capture-recapture data and compared with the multinomial conditional logit model (MCLM). The proposed model is very similar to the MCLM in dealing with continuous covariates and the analytic confidence interval performs better than the bootstrap estimate in case of small sample size.",

        "abstract": "High voltage live-line maintenance (LLM) became a decisive working method in Hungary in the 1960s. Most of the LLM techniques and equipment - which are still in operation nowadays - were developed by Dr. Béla Csikós, who was one of the pioneers of high voltage live-line work. In those days the live maintainability of the power lines was a significant aspect during the design of towers and insulator strings. Contrarily, structures change year-by-year, especially regarding the insulators. Therefore, live working methods also shall be developed. Nowadays, new types of tower structures and insulator strings are used with reduced distances, which also means reduced clearance between the different potentials in the arrangement. During barehand live working method, the lineman has to keep the adequate distances from different potentials of power lines. Moreover, there is no uniform standard and international practice for the regulation of safety clearances. New type of mounting chair made of non-conductive material is suitable for approaching the insulator strings and their fittings safely, as the air gap between the conductive parts does not shorten. The aim of this paper is to investigate the usability of non-conductive mounting chair and the regulation of phase-to-ground clearances during insulator replacement technology, in case of several tower types and insulator types used in the Hungarian transmission grid. Another purpose of this article is to examine the possibility of reducing minimal approach distances, such as by the application of portable protective air gap (PPAG).",

        "abstract": "The pastoral indigenous communities living in southern Africa at the start of the colonial period were the fi rst to be dispossessed of their rights in land. They had exercised these rights in terms of their customary law systems for centuries before the arrival of non-indigenous settlers in 1652. During the nineteenth century, the fi nal acts of dispossession of land took place in terms of racially discriminatory legislation and administrative actions, just like the dispossession of land that took place after 19 June 1913. However, the descendants of these communities are unable to claim restoration of their rights in land in terms of the constitutional land reform programme.

The German and British laws were reviewed in comparison with the Korean laws, focusing on the similarities and differences among the laws and which parts require revision. This study reported that patient care should be considered not only from a constitutional point of view, but also from a health care point of view. Self-determination and medical paternalism are both important but generally incompatible values. In recent days, objective and fair diagnosis from medical experts have been challenging. The current Mental Health Act was inevitably revised to actively accept the decisions of the Constitutional Court and apparently guarantee the basic rights of people in the future. The pros and cons of “the committee for the appropriateness of hospitalization” and which parts need to be revised to perform its role properly as a guardian of the admission procedure are assessed. This should reflect the current reality of the mental health medical community. In addition, a face-to-face examination should be made in principle. Nevertheless, the basic rights of the mentally ill are not guaranteed based on current law because of the shortage of budget and human resources. The final option maybe the introduction of a judicial system on involuntary admission. Legitimacy and professionalism are engagements that should be adhered to when treating psychiatric patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of four types of CFI on the activity patterns of the lower limb muscles (LLM) in healthy people during sport motorcycling. Methods: This was a cross-over trial (NCT03734133. Participants were recruited from an outpatient foot specialist clinic. Their mean age was 33 ± 5.14 years. While participants were sport motorcycling in a simulator, the electromyography (EMG) function was registered for LLM via surface electrodes. Participants completed separate tests while wearing one of four types of CFI: (1) only polypropylene (58° Shore D), (2) selective aluminum (60 HB Brinell hardness) in metatarsal and first hallux areas and polypropylene elsewhere (58° Shore D), (3) ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) (52° Shore A), and (4) standard EVA (25° Shore A) as the control. Results: The activity patterns of the LLM while sport motorcycling showed significantly lower peak amplitude for the selective aluminum CFI than the other types of CFI. Conclusion: EMG amplitude peaks for several LLM were smaller for the hardest CFI (selective aluminum 60 HB Brinell hardness) than the other CFIs (polypropylene 58° Shore D, EVA 52° Shore A, and standard EVA 25° Shore A), except for the fibularis longus in right curves that is increased when the knee touches the road increasing the stability.",

President Duterte’s bold campaign promises were backed by wide public support, a supermajority coalition in Congress, and a unified Cabinet. Indeed, empirical evidence points to how the President’s coalition in Congress, upcoming national elections, and the President’s capacity to tag bills as urgent or priority can help fast-track the passage of laws. While this was able to translate to high legislative productivity in the 17th and 18th Congresses, crucial aspects of the President’s legislative agenda still remain pending. Moreover, key reforms that were passed are widely criticized for promoting efficiency over equity and for falling short in addressing key governance issues. Even though the President had the unprecedented institutional means to steer legislation to his agenda, we find that Duterte is no different from his predecessors who prioritize short-term and rewarding laws over meaningful long-term reforms.",

Cellulase enzyme preparation from Penicillium funicu/osum was incorporated at a rate of 5g/100kg per diet. D-L methionine and L-lysine were added to supply these amino acids at 15% above the NRC (1994) requirements. Results indicated a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in feed intake and body weight gain when chicks were fed diets containing 10% LLM. Addition of enzyme did not affect feed intake or weight gain as compared to the control group. Addition of amino acids and enzyme alone or in combination significantly improved feed conversion when compared to group fed LLM with no supplement.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Over the last years, universities have diversified their educational offer, understanding and emphasizing the role of foreign languages in enhancing both personal and professional growth. Study programmes at undergraduate level have a mandatory foreign language component and there is a tendency to provide master’s programmes in foreign languages especially in the field of law, business, political sciences, international relations, etc. In this framework, the paper attempts to identify and present the steps to be taken in designing a legal English course for students who complete their Master of Laws (LLM) degree in Human Rights. The focus is on the development of such a course as an essential element of a syllabus. The paper discusses the subject content of the course, i.e. the areas within each topic meant to improve and expand the students’ specialist vocabulary which will further enable them to operate effectively in the field of human rights, the language content and the language skills which must be practised, while also analyzing subject-based materials and language materials.",

        "abstract": "The transmission and distribution network play a central role in the electricity system. According to this, their operational safety and reliability are highly important due to the continuous availability of electrical energy. Live Working (hereinafter referred to as LW) is a group of activities where line workers work on energized network elements, reducing the number of blackouts and interrupts on the network. However, in the last few years the electricity system has changed, so that new challenges have been appeared for system operators. One of the main goals is to increase the flexibility of the transmission and distribution network while maintaining the reliability level. As a result, new methods such as Dynamic Line Rating (hereinafter referred to as DLR) are being introduced to increase the capacity of transmission lines. In addition to the emergence of new methods, existing technologies also need to be reviewed. The main aim of this article is to present how live line maintenance (LLM) equipment test and technology education were revised, and how DLR method could improve the reliability of the distribution network.",

        "abstract": "One of the salient features of economic development is its pronounced urban dimension. As in other advanced economies, most economic activity in Italy is concentrated in urban areas: in 2001, the 73 urban Local Labor Markets (LLM) produced 62 percent of Italian value added. Since the 1980s, Italian urban agglomerations have increased in size, both in economic terms and in terms of occupied area, absorbing a growing number of municipalities. This process is reflected in the rising contribution of urban LLMs to the aggregate dynamics of population, employees, plants and income. Urban areas stand out for being better able to attract high-skilled workers, for having a higher concentration of innovative activity and for being more specialized in knowledge-intensive services (KIS). Even net of observable characteristics, cities maintain a performance advantage with respect to non-urban areas: in terms of labor productivity, the urban premium is nil for industry and it amounts to 3 percent for services.",

This paper attempts to test the effectiveness of log-linear models (LLM) to estimate the suspended (S-LMM), dissolved (D-LLM), and total suspended (T-LLM) load into a Mediterranean semiarid karst stream (the Argos River basin, in southeast Spain). An assessment of the supposed validity of each model and a leave-one-out cross-validation were carried out to determine their degree of statistical robustness. The T-LLM model showed higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.15, and PE = ±5.4–6.6%) than the D-LLM model (R2 = 0.97, RMSE = 0.16, and PE = ±5.5–6.8%) or the D-LLM model (R2 = 0.77, RMSE = 0.71, and PE = ±101–493%). In addition, different model variants, according to two flow patterns (FP1 = base flow and FP2 = rising water level), were developed. The FP2-SLLM model provided a very good fit (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.34, and PE = ±25.3–61.5%), substantially improving the results of the S-LLM model.",

        "abstract": "World-wide the turbidity of many rivers, estuaries and shallow seas is increasing, leading to degradation of water quality and growing siltation. Large volumes of dredged sediments are disposed and lost offshore, while coastal regions and river banks are eroding, exposing towns to more recurrent flooding. A huge amount of sediment is trapped in reservoirs behind dams, reducing their storage and flood mitigation capabilities. These are all indicators that smart and integrated sediment management is necessary. At the same time, coastal development activities demand for large quantities of sediment as building material, with many areas of the world characterized by fine sediments (mud), especially in large river delta regions. Integrated sediment management approaches leveraging on Building with Nature (BwN) concepts represents a potentially powerful solution to these enormous world-wide challenges and societal needs. With this in mind, EcoShape initiated the Living Lab for Mud (LLM), an initiative that aims to develop integrated knowledge and technologies to improve understanding and implementation of management, use and reuse of (fine and soft) sediments often linked to the reinforcement, safety and restoration of coastal ecosystems (e.g. salt marshes and mangroves) or land reclamation.The LLM consists of a series of pilot projects within and outside the Netherlands, which integrate the various aspects and processes of sediment management: from sedimentation and resuspension, to fate and transport, to consolidation and strength development. The LLM integrates these physical processes with biota and socio-economic aspects, in order to develop feasible, applicable and sustainable BwN based solutions. Pilots include strategic sediment disposal to naturally nourish coastal mudflats (i.e. Mud Motor, The Netherlands), enhancing sediment trapping to encourage mangroves restoration and coastal aggradation (i.e. Demak, Indonesia), and ripening of fine dredged sediments for production of building material (i.e. Kleirijperij, The Netherlands).This presentation will introduce the LLM initiative and give an overview of these pilot projects.",

In the first part, it explores the theoretical underpinnings of capacity-enhancement through university education and analyses how the intertwined processes of internationalisation and Africanisation can contribute to capacity-enhancement and development in Africa. It is argued that the concept of intellectual metissage, as a form of intellectual cross-fertilisation across international borders, is a necessary and appropriate tool to drive internationalisation with the aim of fulfilling the developmental mandate of African universities.

        "abstract": "Dietary protein intake is critical for maintaining an optimal muscle mass, especially among older individuals. Although protein supplementation during resistance training (RT) has been shown to further augment training-induced muscle mass in older individuals, the impact of daily variations in protein intake on training-induced muscle mass has not been explored thus far. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the dietary protein and amino acid intake and RT-induced muscle hypertrophy among older individuals. Ten healthy older men (n=10; mean age=69±2 y; body weight (BW)=61.5±2.2 kg; height=1.65±0.02 m) participated in progressive RT performed 3 times/wk for 12 wk. Body composition (using DXA) and nutritional assessments (using a 3-d dietary record) were performed before and after the training period. Leg lean mass (LLM) increased significantly (15.0±0.8 vs. 15.4±0.8 kg, p<0.05) after RT, with no change in dietary nutrient intake. The average dietary protein intake was 1.62±0.11 g/kg BW/d, while essential amino acids was 600±51 mg/kg BW/d. Although the correlation between the increase in LLM and dietary protein intake was not significant, a significant correlation was found between the increase in LLM and dietary essential amino acid (EAA) intake. Furthermore, there were significant correlations between the increase in LLM and protein as well as EAA (especially leucine) intake at breakfast among subjects with suboptimal protein intake (p<0.05). Our study findings indicate that dietary protein as well as EAA intake may be significant contributing factors in muscle hypertrophic response during RT among healthy older men.",

Patients and methods This retrospective cohort study utilized a nationally representative managed care database to identify newly diagnosed ASCVD patients between January 1, 2007, and November 30, 2012 (index = first ASCVD diagnosis date) in the USA. Patients had ≥12-month pre-index (baseline) and ≥12-month post-index (follow-up) health plan enrollment and no baseline lipid-lowering medication (LLM). Patient characteristics, LLM utilization patterns, HCRU, and costs were examined for all patients and by subgroups based on LLM use pattern and/or follow-up low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Results A total of 128,017 ASCVD patients were identified with a mean (SD) age of 59 (13) years, 43.1% female, and 48.8% with ≥36-month follow-up. Within 12-month follow-up, 10.6% had high-intensity statins and 56.9% had no LLM fills. Baseline mean (SD) all-cause costs were $8,852 ($25,608). At 12-month follow-up, mean (SD) all-cause and ASCVD-related costs were $31,443 ($54,040) and $20,289 ($45,159), respectively. The 36-month analyses showed similar distributions. Multivariable analyses showed that age, gender, region, health insurance type, baseline comorbidities, baseline use of specific medications, baseline lipid profiles, and index ASCVD type were significantly associated with all-cause and ASCVD-related health care costs. Conclusion Patients have nonoptimal treatment for ASCVD and substantial HCRU and costs associated with residual risk. Unmet needs and cost burdens of ASCVD patients merit additional investigation.",

Our analysis is based on the evaluation of vacuum expectation values of chiral primary operators from the supersymmetric vacua of mass-deformed ABJM theory and from the implementation of Kaluza-Klein (KK) holography to the LLM geometries. We focus on the chiral primary operator (CPO) with conformal dimension Δ = 1. The non-vanishing vacuum expectation value (vev) implies the breaking of conformal symmetry. In that case, we show that the variation of the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) from it’s value in the CFT, is related to the non-vanishing one-point function due to the relevant deformation as well as the source field. Applying Ryu Takayanagi’s HEE conjecture to the 4-dimensional gravity solutions, which are obtained from the KK reduction of the 11-dimensional LLM solutions, we calculate the variation of the HEE. We show how the vev and the value of the source field determine the HEE.",

Methods: Adults with severeTBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] ≤ 8) admitted alive in intensive care units (ICUs) were prospectively included. Primary endpoints were in-hospital 30-day mortality and extended Glasgow outcome score (GOSE) at 3 years. Association with the intensity of monitoring and outcome was studied by comparing a high level of monitoring (HLM) (systemic and ≥3 specific monitoring) and low level of monitoring (LLM) (systemic and 0–2 specific monitoring) and using inverse probability weighting procedure. Results: 476 patients were included and IPW was used to improve the balance between the two groups of treatments (HLM/LMM). Overall hospital mortality (at 30 days) was 43%, being significantly lower in HLM than LLM group (27% vs. 53%: RR, 1.63: 95% CI: 1.23–2.15). The 14-day hospital mortality was also lower in the HLM group than expected, based upon the CRASH prediction model (35%). At 3 years, disability was not significantly different between the monitoring groups.

The total leaf meal (ton/ha/year) yield from cassava was 4.69 – 7.76 tons (Hoan, 2012; Hien and Trung, 2016), from leucaena was 6.69 9.83 tons (Hoan et al, 2017; Hien et al., 2008) and from stylo was 6.05 tons (Ngoc, 2012). Recently, these leaf meals have been extensively used as feed supplements in poultry diets in order to improve productivity as well as product quality. Thanks to pigment content in these leaf meals, it proved that this content increased chicken’s skin yellow darkness, improved egg yolk color, and increased meat and egg palatability (Sirri et al., 2007; Lascha, 1990; Williams, 1992; Hien et al, 2016). However, in Vietnam, there was very little known about the nutrients digestibility of these leaf meals in chickens Thus, this study was conducted in order to provide more scientifi c evidence of using CLM, LLM, SGM, MLM and TLM to be included into broiler’s diet. Materials and Methods The Luong Phuong broiler breed was used in this experiment from 43 – 50 days of age with a total of 180 birds divid477 Nutrient Digestibility Determination of Cassava, Leucaena, Stylosanthes, Moringa and Trichanthera Leaf Meals... ed into 6 groups, with each group consisting of 5 subgroups of 6 birds each (3 male and 3 female). The leaf of cassava (Manihot esculenta crants), leucaena leucocephala, stylosanthes guianensis, Moringa oleifera and Trichanthera gigantea forage crops was used for this trial. The leaves were sun dried and ground. The ground leaves were screened with 1mm screen mesh prior mixing into basal diet. Six different diets were prepared for the 6 groups including basal diet (BD) without inclusion of leaf meals, experimental diet 1 (ED1) consisting of 80% basal diet plus 20% CLM, experimental diet 2 (ED2) consisting of 80% basal diet plus 20% LLM, experimental diet 3 (ED3) consisting of 80% basal diet plus 20% SGM. Experiment diet 4 (ED4) consisting of 80% basal diet plus 20% MLM and Experiment diet 5 (ED5) consisting of 80% basal diet plus 20% TLM. The exact amount of 1.5% acid insoluble mineral (Cr2O3) was added into each diet. The basal diet was prepared from ground corn, wheat bran, soybean meal, fi sh meal, premix minerals and vitamins. The metabolic energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) contents of the basal diet was in compliance with standard nutrient requirements of the colored feather broiler from 43 days old to slaughter age. The feed ingredients, leaf meal and diets were chemically analyzed before the experiment was conducted. The chemical compositions of leaf meals, basal and experiment diets are presented in Table 1. The trial was conducted in the chicken farm of Thai Nguyen University of agriculture and forestry. The experiment was performed in 7 days. The fi rst 4 days, the birds were given time to adapt to the cage and diets. At 4:00 p.m. on day 4, birds were restricted from feed, at 8:00 a.m. of day 5, the experimental diets were given to birds, at 4:00 p.m. on day7, the birds were restricted from feeds, and at 8:00 a.m. of the day 8, the birds were dissected to collect the ileal contents. Ileal content collection was performed following the method of Bryden et al., 2009; Jamroz et al., 2001; Kadim and Moughan, 2008 The ileal contents were dried at low temperature prior to chemical analysis.. The chemical analysis was done following A.O.A.C., 1990. Acid insoluble ash analysis was performed after Keulen and Young (1977). Each index was analyzed with 5 repetitions Nutrients digestibility was calculated after Tu Quang Hien et al., 2013. Digestibility (%) = 100 – 100 x c/a x b/d Whereas: a nutrient content in diet (% DM), b nutrient content in ileal contents (% DM), c insoluble mineral in feed (%DM) and d insoluble mineral in ileal content (% DM). Results and Discussions ● The chemical composition of diets and ileal contents The chemical composition of the diets and the ileal contents including crude protein, lipid, fi ber, acid insoluble ash was analyzed.

Hien; Tran T. Hoan; Mai A. Khoa; Tu T. Kien; Phan T. Huong; Hoang T. H. Nhung Based on the chemical composition and acid insoluble ash contents of the diets and the ileal contents presented in Table 2 and Table 3, the digestibility of diet’s nutrients were calculated. ● The nutrients digestibility of experimental diets There were 3 steps in order to determine the nutrient digestibility of the experimental diets, including i) Determination of acid insoluble ash / nutrients ratio (c/a) of the diets, ii) Determination of nutrients / acid insoluble ash ratio (b/d) of the ileal contents, and iii) Based on the formula described in the materials and methods section to calculate the nutrient digestibility. Based on the acid insoluble ash content (c) and nutrients content in the diets (a) presented in Table 2, the ratio (c/a) was calculated and is presented in Table 4. Based on the nutrient content (b) and acid insoluble ash (d) in ileal contents presented in Table 3, the (b/d) ratio was calculated and is presented in Table 5. Based on the c/a ratio in the diets and the b/d ratio in the ileal contents, the nutrient digestibility of the experimental diets was calculated by using the formula described in the Materials and Methods section. The results are shown in Table 6. Based on data presented in Table 6, it can be predicted that the digestibility of protein from LLM, SGM, MLM was higher than that from CLM, TLM, and the digestibility of lipid from CLM, LLM, MLM was higher than that from SGM, TLM whereas, fi ber digestibility of SGM was lower than that of CLM, LLM, MLM and TLM. ● Nutrients digestibility of leaf meals In order to determine the nutrients digestibility of leaf meals, 3 steps had to be done, i) Determination of total leaf meals nutrients intake, ii) Determination of total digested leaf meals nutrients, and iii) Digestibility of leaf meals nutrients. Step 1: Total leaf meals nutrient intake Total leaf meal nutrient intake (here after named as C) was calculated based on the nutrient intake from the experimental diets (ED) here after named as A, minus the nutrient content in basal diet (BD in ED) here after named as B. The total leaf meals nutrient intake was C = A – B. The calculation results are presented in Table 7. Data presented in Table 7 showed that the crude protein intakes of MLM was the highest, followed by LLM, TLM, CLM and SGM, that of lipid was ranked in order from highest to lowest as CLM, MLM, LLM TLM and then SGM, and that of fi ber was ranked from highest to lowest as SGM, CLM, TLM, MLM and then LLM. Thus, when total feed intake was similar amongst the treatments, the total nutrient intake depended on the nutrient content in the leaf meal Step 2: The total digested nutrients of leaf meals The amount of digested nutrient content in leaf meals, here after named as D, was calculated based on the digested nutrients",

        "abstract": "This dissertation, written as part of the “LLM in Transnational and European Commercial Law, Mediation, Arbitration and Energy Law” at International Hellenic University, addresses the right of states to regulate in the international investment law regime. The thesis focuses on the foreign investors' and host states' conflicting interests. Foreign investors have a strong interest in the stability of the favorable legal and political framework of the host state where they chose to invest. On the other hand, host states want to reserve a degree of flexibility in order to protect their vital domestic interests and adapt their policies to changing circumstances. Achieving an appropriate balance between these two conflicting interests constitutes the principal challenge for modern international investment law. Until recently IIAs, particularly BITs, were characterized by a strong asymmetry focusing almost entirely on foreign investment promotion and protection while remaining silent with regard to states' public interests. In this context, a notable trend has emerged over the last few years towards safeguarding the right of states to regulate with the aim to remedy this imbalance. This thesis examines how this trend is reflected in more recent IIAs and the innovations introduced by them for this purpose. Moreover, with the support of the case law of ICSID, the leading arbitration institution for the settlement of investment disputes, this work attempts to establish clear rules for the distinction between indirect expropriations of foreign investments requiring compensation and non-compensable governmental measures adopted for the pursuance of states' legitimate public welfare objectives. To this end, special attention is paid on the so called “police powers doctrine”, inserting an exception to the general rule that compensation must be paid for expropriation. The thesis ends with some recommendations for the reform of the IIA regime in light of UNCTAD's recent initiatives in this regard, so as to enhance the right of states to regulate in the public interest while maintaining favorable investment conditions, ultimately reflecting the interests of all stakeholders.",

An experimental device performing the vertical suspension of fabric-liquid surface and permitting the penetration of water molecules through the tested samples is used. Experimental values of vertical wicking were gravimetrically measured using an electronic microbalance, and theoretically studied using the linear logarithmic model (LLM). The results show that the theoretical predictions are in reasonable agreement with the experimental data with high correlation coefficients values. It is also demonstrated that capillary rise kinetics are influenced by knitted fabric features, such as composition, knit structure, type of yarn and of couliering depth value. Water sorption kinetics of cotton fabrics have also been studied and modeled by using mass measurements of the water absorbed by the textile and the LLM equation in order to interpret the experimental data in terms of sorption ability.",

They function as an irrevocable promise of issuing a bank to pay instead of an applicant buyer to a beneficiary seller under the condition that the beneficiary presents complying documents with terms and conditions of the credit to the bank. One of the reasons for the popularity of the LCs in international trade is shifting the payment risk from an individual buyer to a bank with a much stronger financial standing. However, LC operation in international trade is not free of risk. Despite the fact that two main principles of the Documentary Letter of Credit’s Operation (Principle of independence and principle of strict compliance) facilitate the process of international trade significantly, but still all parties involved in LC operation are supposed to be cautious about the existing risks relevant to their role in LC operation.

        "abstract": "Some low-n kink-ballooning modes not far from marginal stability are shown to exhibit a bifurcation between two very distinct nonlinear paths that depends sensitively on the background transport levels and linear perturbation amplitudes. The particular instability studied in this work is an n=1 mode dominated by an m/n=2/1 component. It is driven by a large pressure gradient in weak magnetic shear and can appear in various high-β, hybrid/advanced scenarios. Here it is investigated in reversed shear equilibria where the region around the safety-factor minimum provides the low-shear conditions necessary for instability. For a certain range of parameters, a relatively benign path results in a saturated ‘long-lived mode’ (LLM) that causes little confinement degradation. At the other extreme, the quadrupole geometry of the 2/1 perturbed pressure field evolves into a ballooning finger that subsequently transitions from exponential to explosive growth. The finger eventually leads to a fast disruption with precursors too short for any mitigation effort. Interestingly, the saturated LLM state is found to be metastable; it also can be driven explosively unstable by finite-amplitude perturbations. Similarities to some high-β disruptions in reversed-shear discharges are discussed.",

A total of 101 patients were included in this study, with age of 55 (26-84) years. There were 25 (24.8%) and 76 (75.2%) patients with and without palpable inguinal lymph node enlargement, respectively. There were 47 cases (46.5%), 40 cases (39.6%) and 14 cases (13.9%) in T1, T2 and T3 stages, respectively; there were 67 cases (66.3%), 21 cases (20.8%) and 13 cases (12.9%) in Broder 1, 2 and 3, respectively.

        "abstract": "ABSTRAK Muhammad Al Kautsar 2019 Pembatasan Periodesasi Masa Jabatan Anggota Legislatif Fakultas Hukum Universitas Syiah Kuala (vii, 57) pp., bibl., (Kurniawan, S.H., LLM) Sensitivitas anggota DPR yang telah lama menjabat untuk lebih peduli pada rakyat juga tak telihat. Justru malah ironi, dimana korupsi dikalangan anggota legislatif semakin menjadi. Terbukti dari data yang dirilis oleh KPK dari tahun 2010-2016 tingkat korupsi dibadan legislatif semakin memburuk. Hal ini memberikan pandangan bahwa anggota DPR saat ini yang tidak ada batasan masa jabatan sangat rentan akan terkena kasus korupsi. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menjelaskan dasar pertimbangan terhadap UU Pileg tidak memberikan batasan periodesasi masa jabatan dan implikasi terhadap ketiadaan pembatasan periodesasi masa jabatan anggota legislatif dikaitkan dengan asas kepastian hukum. Skripsi ini menggunakan metode penelitian yang diperoleh dari data kepustakaan, peraturan perundang-undangan dan dokumentasi dari berbagai media online dengan ditambah data lapangan berupa wawancara dari beberapa narasumber terkait. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa pertimbangan UU Pileg tidak memberikan batasan periodesasi terhadap masa jabatan anggota legislatif karena pada dasarnya pemilihan umum terhadap legislatif tidak boleh membatasi subjek untuk dapat bertarung dalam pemilihan umum secara serentak, telah ada ambang batas parlemen bagi partai politik untuk dapat menduduki kursi anggota legislatif dan hal-hal terkait pembatasan masa jabatan diatur didalam AD/ART Partai Politik. Implikasi dari ketiadaan pembatasan periodesasi masa jabatan anggota legislatif : banyak kasus korupsi yang menjerat anggota legislatif, kekuasaan yang ada pada anggota legislatif cenderung konservatif yang akan melahirkan demokrasi yang mengarah kepada demokrasi kapital, melahirkan kekuasaan yang bersifat absolutisme sehingga frame yang dibangun dalam lingkaran legislatif frame yang menguntungkan individu atau kelompok tertentu. Berdasarkan temuan tersebut ada beberapa tawaran solusi yang dapat dijadikan acuan bagi masa jabatan anggota legislatif kedepannya yaitu merevisi UU Pileg dan UU Pemilu dengan menambahkan pembatasan periodesasi masa jabatan anggota legislatif, merubah konsep terhadap demokrasi guna menjadi lebih baik dengan memberikan batasan terhadap periodesasi masa jabatan anggota legislatif berkisar 2 periodesasi.",

        "abstract": "This study aimed to determine nutrient intake and performance of male New Zealand White rabbits fed complete feed pellets containing different level of Leucaena leaf meal (LLM). A total of 20 rabbits was randomly divided into four groups and fed diets containing 0% (P0), 5% (P1), 10% (P2), and 15% LLM (P3), for a duration of 10 weeks. The crude proteins (CP) of the diets were 17.7-18.1% and energy of the diets were 2,277.1-2,541.7 kcal/kg. Data were collected on a weekly basis and analyzed by analysis of variance. The results showed that nutrient intake, average daily gain (ADG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of male New Zealand White rabbits fed pellet containing 10% LLM was higher (P<0.05) than those fed the other diets. The dry matter (DM), CP, extract ether (EE), and crude fiber (CF) intakes of P2 were highest, they were 80.04±3.96, 16.43±0.81, 6.64±0.33, 15.84±0.78 (g DM/head/day), respectively. The ADG was 20.20±2.29 g/head/day and FCR was 4.60±0.55. It is concluded that 10% LLM in complete feed pellets improved the growth performance and nutrient intakes of male New Zealand White rabbits.",

This dissertation focuses on blockchain relevance, as it emerges as a drastic solution in a series of problems, a panacea for decentralisation and more democratic approach to transactions. The paper provides an overview of blockchain technology as well as the basic model of blockchain transaction and concepts. Follows a thorough analysis about the possible uses of blockchain technology in energy, particularly in electricity sector. Afterwards the articles lists legal and regulatory implications on the energy field. Finally it takes a closer view on critical evaluation on legal and regulatory level in electricity sector. The analysis does not provide a definite position about the level of blockchain applications in electricity markets and points out criticism and the disadvantages or limitations due to “peculiarities” of the electricity industry. Either way the author is reluctant to take a unambiguous view, besides the extremely optimistic declarations of the tech industry. I would like to thank my supervisor Dr iur Komninos Komnios, that accepted the challenge of supervising a theme that is quite technical with limited if none academic literature for the issue in hand.

        "title": "Energy and protein values of lucerne leaf meal in growing pigs",
        "abstract": "Forage legumes efficiently utilise the growing season and represent a relevant way to ensure soil cover and to produce high protein yields. Among the range of forage, leaf fraction of lucerne would be considered as a valuable protein source for swine. Two experiments were thus conducted to determine the energy and the protein values of lucerne leaf meal (LLM) in growing pigs. In the first experiment, total tract digestibility coefficient (TTD) of energy was measured on a total of 25 pigs (60 kg BW) randomly allotted to five different dietary treatments: 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% of LLM was incorporated in a wheat-soybean meal diet. On a dry matter basis, the average crude protein (CP), lysine, crude fibre and gross energy contents of LLM were 25.3%, 1.09%, 15.5% and 19.3 MJ/kg, respectively. After 10-days adaptation period, faeces and urines were collected during seven consecutive days. In the second experiment, the apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal digestibility coefficient of AA were measured on five pigs (32.4 kg) fitted with ileo-rectal anastomosis and arranged in a 5×5 Latin square design with 6 periods and five diets containing 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% of LLM. Pigs were fed each of the five diets during one 7-days period, and ileal digesta were collected on d 5, 6 and 7. On the 6th period, all the pigs were fed with a free protein diet for the measurement of the basal ileal endogenous. As expected, the TTD of energy linearly decreased with increasing inclusion of LLM in the diet. On average, the TTD value and the digestible energy content of leaf meal were 45.4% and 8.5 MJ/kg. Increasing the rate of incorporation of LLM reduced the AID for crude protein and amino acids. This reduction was linear (P<0.05). On average, the AID and SID of lysine were 57.7 and 62.5%, respectively. These low digestibility of energy and lysine are probably explained by the presence of anti-nutritional factors (saponins, polyphenols, etc.) at a high concentration in the LLM.",

        "abstract": "Increased beta-oxidation of fatty acids to meet energy demand is a rather unique characteristic of a subset of human prostate cancers. A safe and effective intervention for inhibition of fatty acid synthesis is still a clinically unmet need. We have shown previously that leelamine (LLM), a phytochemical derived from pine tree bark, suppresses expression and activity of full-length androgen receptor (AR) and its splice variants in vitro and in vivo in preclinical models of prostate cancer. Because AR is implicated in regulation of fatty acid metabolism, the present study was undertaken to determine the effect of LLM on this metabolic pathway. Treatment of a castration-resistant (22Rv1) as well as an androgen-responsive (LNCaP) human prostate cancer cell line with LLM (2.5 and 5 µmol/L) resulted in downregulation of key fatty acid synthesis enzyme proteins including ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). LLM treatment also decreased intracellular levels of total free fatty acids and neutral lipid droplets in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Consistent with the in vitro results, we also observed a significant decrease in ACLY and SREBP1 protein expression and number of neutral lipid droplets in vivo in tumor tissue sections of 22Rv1 xenografts after intraperitoneal administration of LLM (9.1 mg/kg bw/ day, 5 times/week) compared to controls. Studies are in progress to determine if overexpression of AR and/or SREBP1 confers protection against fatty acid synthesis inhibition by LLM. In conclusion, it is reasonable to postulate that suppression of AR-SREBP1 regulated fatty acid metabolism is an important mechanism in prostate cancer inhibition by LLM.

According to our estimates, starting with a ten per cent higher share of college-educated residents was associated with a higher growth in employment in the 0.5-2.2 per cent range. These results hold when considering both the municipal and the local labour market (LLM) levels, and they are robust to a wide set of urban characteristics. Our findings are confirmed using a measure of education dating back to 1931 as an instrument for human capital. Furthermore, we exploit a spatial localization model with human capital premiums to disentangle the estimated effect into two components related to productivity and life quality respectively. We find that productivity contributed to more than 60 per cent of the effect of human capital on urban growth at municipal level, and to over 90 per cent at the wider LLM level.",

        "abstract": "Typically, Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) layers on expressway flexible pavements tend to take up the flexural loading more than the top layers with binder and wearing courses. A lot of road failures associated with DBM are reflected as tensile cracks or typically know as Alligator cracks. In view of this mechanism of failure, a new thinking was foreseen in reinforcing the DBM layer with Chained Interlocking Plastic Beads (CIPB) to enhance the fatigue resistance of the layer. The CIPB in the DBM layer greatly reinforced and improved the interlocking mechanism within the pavement layer. The asphaltic binder with 60-70 penetration grade was used and the gradation for this DBM was selected in accordance with Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia (LLM) specification. CIPB of two diamond shaped beads are linked with 0.5 mm to 1.0 mm diameter strands. In this study, different percentages of CIPB were added into the bituminous mixture to determine the percentage of CIPB that would optimize the strength of DBM in term of resilient modulus, stability, and density. Several appropriate tests were conducted to determine the volumetric properties and stiffness modulus of the designed mixtures to determine the Optimum Asphalt Content (OAC). Based on the test results obtained, the CIPB did produce better interlocking mechanism within the mixture and greatly improved the stiffness and stability of the mixture. From this study it was observed that, with an adequate amount of CIPB, the performance of the DBM mixture improved the Marshall stability and resilient modulus. The study shows that the newly developed interlocking mechanism with CIPB has great potential to minimize tensile cracks that migrate to the top through the binder and wearing courses and thus extend the life of the pavement. Such long lasting effect may certainly reduce the road rehabilitation costs. The objectives of this study was to determine the Optimum Chained Interlocking Plastic Beads content in Dense Bituminous Macadam and to evaluate the capability of Chained Interlocking Plastic Beads in enhancing properties of Dense Bituminous Macadam.",

        "abstract": "\n BACKGROUND\n Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Computer-based training programs can improve cognitive performance in elderly populations. However, the effects of computer-based interventions on MCI APOE ε4 carriers have never been studied before.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n The effects of different web-based interventions and the APOE isoform-specific differences in training outcomes are investigated.\n \n \n METHODS\n Using a quasi-experimental study design, 202 participants with MCI aged 60 years and older took part in three different intervention programs (physical and cognitive [Long-Lasting Memories, or LLM], cognitive [Active Control, or AC], or physical intervention [Physical Training Control, or PTC]) via an innovative information and communication technologies exergaming platform. Participants in each interventional group were subdivided into APOE ε4 carriers and non–APOE ε4 carriers. All participants underwent an extensive neuropsychological evaluation before and after the training, blood tests, and brain imaging.\n \n \n RESULTS\n All interventions resulted in multiple statistically significant cognitive benefits after the intervention. Verbal learning (California Verbal Learning Test: immediate recall test score—LLM: P=.04; AC: P<.001), working memory (digit span forward and backward test scores—AC: P=.03; PTC: P=.02 and P=.006, respectively), and long-term memory (California Verbal Learning Test: delayed recall test score—LLM: P=.02; AC: P=.002; and PTC: P=.02) were improved. There was no statistically significant difference among the intervention effects. APOE ε4 presence moderates intervention effects as the LLM intervention improved only their task-switching processing speed (Trail Making Test, Part B: P=.03) and the PTC intervention improved only the working memory (digit span backward: P=.03). No significant performance alteration was noted for the APOE ε4+ cognitive AC training group.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n None of the applied interventions could be identified as the optimal one; it is suggested, however, that combined cognitive and physical training and physical training via exergaming may be more effective for the high-risk MCI ΑPOE ε4+ subgroup.\n",

        "abstract": "In the US, private equity 'club deals' have raised controversy as to potential risks of price fixing by consorting private equity firms. Surprisingly in Europe, private equity has managed to slip through the notorious far-reaching hand of the European Commission. This purpose of this paper is to shed an initial light on the issue of private equity consortia and how they fit in the contemporary European competition regime. Two essential competition concerns that have been brought up (1) private equity consortia entail a Monopsony setting. In an auction, the number of bidders are restricted, as a result that the bidding prices will drop below the competition price. (2) Private Equity consortia members share sensitive information in an auction in order to rig the bidding process (bid-rigging). Both concerns are examined against the background of the current European competition law framework. The first concern is examined in the light of the contemporary E.C. Merger Control regime. The second competition concern is subjected to article 81 §1 EC. The cogent result of this paper is that there are, hitherto, no genuine competition impediment by private equity consortia. It appeared that the counterfactual used in a Monoposony setting did not apply in the case of private equity consortia. Similar to the US, in Europe private equity consortia operate in a plural market. The trend of private equity consortium is often compensated by other players that also participate (strategic players). Regarding the bid-rigging concerns, there was no actual empirical data available to determine the activities in Europe. We therefore assume that these practices have not (yet) occurred in the European situation.",

The purpose of this single case study was to explore strategies virtual team leaders in large corporate banks use to build trust among virtual team members. The population of this study included 6 virtual team leaders from a large corporate bank located in the northeast region of the United States. The interpersonal trust theory was the conceptual framework of this study. Data were collected via semistructured telephone interviews and review of company documents. The data analysis process included content analysis and thematic analysis for theme identification. Data analysis revealed four themes related to strategies that leaders of virtual teams can use to build trust among team members: reliable technology, effective communication, teamwork and participation, and respect for people and culture. A fifth theme emerged related to barriers to trust strategies. The implications for positive social change include the potential to improve work environments for virtual team members isolated because of the absence of a social context.Virtual teams often fail to achieve their objectives because virtual team leaders lack strategies for nurturing trust among dispersed team members. The purpose of this single case study was to explore strategies virtual team leaders in large corporate banks use to build trust among virtual team members. The population of this study included 6 virtual team leaders from a large corporate bank located in the northeast region of the United States. The interpersonal trust theory was the conceptual framework of this study. Data were collected via semistructured telephone interviews and review of company documents. The data analysis process included content analysis and thematic analysis for theme identification. Data analysis revealed four themes related to strategies that leaders of virtual teams can use to build trust among team members: reliable technology, effective communication, teamwork and participation, and respect for people and culture. A fifth theme emerged related to barriers to trust strategies. The implications for positive social change include the potential to improve work environments for virtual team members isolated because of the absence of a social context.

        "abstract": "\n \n \n 2D-speckle tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) derived strain measurements has been proposed as a non-invasive measure of myocardial deformation and function. However, the effects of left ventricular (LV) loading conditions on 2D-STE derived LV longitudinal strain (GLS) have not been totally elucidated and the results of some studies regarding the load dependency of GLS are controversial.\n \n \n \n To characterize the effects of acute load change (preload increase) on LV GLS.\n \n \n \n We evaluated the variation of LV GLS by 2D-STE, in response to a preload increasing maneuver (leg lifting maneuver – LLM), in a population of 30 healthy individuals. Clinical, demographic and echocardiographic parameters (including LV longitudinal mechanics obtained with 2D-STE before and after LLM) were described. The population had a mean age of 27±4 years and 73% were women. Increased preload to the heart with LLM was confirmed by an increase in the maximal diameter of the inferior vena cava (16±3.5 vs 22±3.3 mm, p<0.01). No significant changes in left atrial volume, LV ejection volume and LV ejection fraction were observed in response to the LLM. There was a significant variation of global LV GLS (−21.9±2.3 vs −23.2±1.6%, p<0.001, Δ 1.25%, 95% CI 0.5–1.91) – figure. An increase in right ventricular longitudinal function with LLM (TAPSE 22.5±5.4 vs 25.5±0.5 mm, p=0.005, Δ 2.9, 95% CI 0.9–4.8) was also observed.\n \n \n \n \n To our knowledge this is the first study performed to assess the effect of preload increase in GLS using the LLM in healthy individuals. In this study, the absolute LV GLS value increased significantly in response to preload increase (LLM). The dependence of GLS on preload is in accordance with the Frank-Starling Law, in which an increase in preload in a healthy individual lead to an increase in myocardial contractility. These findings suggest that LV GLS is a sensitive parameter for detecting subtle changes in LV longitudinal function.\n",

        "title": "P621Variation of global longitudinal strain (2D STE) with passive leg lifting maneuver: a marker of myocardial functional reserve?",
        "abstract": "\n \n \n In a normal heart, the passive leg lifting maneuver (LLM) will result in an increase in myocardial contractility, according to the mechanistic concept of the Frank-Starling law. With the progression of myocardial disease this ability is impaired and the myocardial functional reserve (mFR) is reduced (Figure1 – Panel A). The variation of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (as an index of contractile function) with LLM may thus represent a marker of left ventricular mFR.\n \n \n \n To assess the variation of left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV GLS) with LLM as a marker of mFR in a healthy population and in patients with myocardial disease (hypertrophic myocardiopathy - HCM and systolic dysfunction patients – SystDysf.\n \n \n \n We evaluated the variation of LV GLS by 2-dimensional Speckle Tracking Echocardiography (2D-STE), in response to passive LLM, in a population of 103 individuals (54 healthy individuals, 28 HCM patients and 21 left ventricular SystDysf patients). Clinical, demographic and echocardiographic parameters (including LV longitudinal mechanics obtained with 2D-STE before and after LLM) were described. The population had a mean age of 46±18 years and 55% were women. Increased venous return to the heart during LLM was confirmed by an increase in the maximal diameter of the inferior vena cava (15,1±3,6 vs 20,6±3,8 mm, p<0.001).\n There was a significant variation of LV GLS in healthy individuals submitted to LLM (−20,58±3,0 vs −21,5±2,6%, p=0,02, Δ 0,6%, 95% CI 0,1–1,1%). Regarding the HCM and SystDysf groups, no significant change in LV GLS was observed with LLM (−13,2±2,8 vs −12,3±2,9%, p=0,12, Δ +0,6%, 95% CI −1,4 to 0,18% and −10,2±2,5 vs 10,2±2,7%, p=0,79, Δ 0,08%, 95% CI −0,7 to 0,5%, respectively). Figure 1 (Panel B)\n \n \n \n \n To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the use of LV GLS and LLM to assess mFR in this clinical setting. The absolute increase of LV GLS in the healthy population suggests that this may be a reliable method and a sensitive marker to assess the mFR. Conversely, patients with HCM and with SystDysf show poor or no response to the LLM, suggesting, as expected, a low myocardial functional reserve. Given the non-invasiveness and cost-effectiveness nature of this technique, we suggest that this maneuver could pose a feasible way to assess mFR. Further studies are needed to validate this technique and to assess the role of mFR by 2D-STE as a prognostic marker.\n",

        "abstract": "\n BACKGROUND\n Korean-Chinese (KC) women make up the largest group of female migrants in South Korea. To prevent and manage chronic diseases in middle-aged KC women working full time, it is necessary to develop health promotion programs that utilize an online platform because such a platform would allow individuals to participate in health promotion interventions at their convenience.\n \n \n OBJECTIVE\n This study aimed to develop a living lab for a mobile-based health (LLm Health) program focused on improving the physical activity and cultural adaptation of KC women workers.\n \n \n METHODS\n We used a mixed methods design. Living lab principles were factored into the LLm Health program, including the use of multiple methods, user engagement, multistakeholder participants, real-life settings, and cocreation. The program was developed using the 4 steps of the intervention mapping method: needs assessment, setting of objectives, identification of intervention strategies, and intervention design. Needs assessment was conducted through a literature review, focus group interviews with a total of 16 middle-aged KC women, and an online survey related to health promotion of migrant workers given to 38 stakeholders. KC middle-aged women participated in the early stages of program development and provided the idea of developing programs and mobile apps to enhance physical activity and acculturation. The mobile app developed in the program was validated with the help of 12 KC women and 4 experts, including 3 nursing professors and a professor of physical education. They were asked to rate each item based on content, interface design, and technology on a 4-point scale using a 23-item Smartphone App Evaluation Tool for Health Care.\n \n \n RESULTS\n The LLm Health program comprised a 24-week walking program using Fitbit devices, the mobile app, and social cognitive interventions. The mobile app contained 6 components: a step counter, an exercise timer, an online chat function, health information, level of cardiovascular risk, and health status. The cultural aspects and lifestyles of KC women were accommodated in the entire process of program development. The content validity of the mobile app was found to be 0.90 and 0.96 according to the 12 KC women and 4 experts, respectively.\n \n \n CONCLUSIONS\n The mobile app was found to be valid and acceptable for KC women. The living lab approach was a useful strategy for developing a culturally adaptive LLm Health program for KC women workers, leading to their active participation in the overall research process, including needs assessment, program composition, and pre-evaluation.\n",

Most young adults in Anambra State lack information on entrepreneurial characteristics to become self-employed. The issues confronting Anambra State as a result of youth unemployment include increase in crime rate, drug abuse, kidnapping and suicide rate. Guided by the human capital theory, the purpose of this case study was to explore the entrepreneurship strategies that young adults in Anambra State needed to become selfemployed after graduating from universities. Twenty youth entrepreneurs participated in the individual interviews, 5 participated in a focus group, and 5 policymakers participated in another individual interview. Data were coded and analysed using Yin’s 5 step procedure involving compiling, assembling, analysing, dissembling and repeating the entire process three times until the themes emerged. The emerging themes were mentorship, vocational training and ad-hoc programs. These findings revealed that youth who participated in these programs (mentorship, vocational training and ad-hoc) obtained entrepreneurial strategies and consequently ran more profitable enterprises than those who did not. The implications for positive social change include recommendations to policy makers to expand the mentoring program among young adults and introduce vocational education that could enhance employment rate, thereby improving the standard of living, and create educational programs for university students with the expectation that upon graduation they may be able to develop businesses that may lead to creation of employment and empower young entrepreneurs towards national growth and development.Nigerian policy is inconsistent with regard to the promotion of entrepreneurship among young adults in Anambra State that would serve as a guide to becoming self-employed.

        "abstract": "Trisomy of human chromosome 21 is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation and leads to Down syndrome (DS). The existing treatments (pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical) of the DS deficiencies focus mainly on ameliorating only a number of symptoms. Our electroencephalography (EEG) study examined the effects of combined physical and cognitive training on DS adults implementing functional cortical network mapping and graph analysis. We investigated whether the cortical alterations could reflect the modification of the cognitive and physical capacity. A three-month intervention protocol of LLM Care was performed to twelve adults with DS. The results were estimated via the comparison of pre- and post-training 5-minute long resting-state EEG recordings, 15-minute long MMN EEG recordings, as well as somatometric, and cognitive assessments. EEG analysis indicated the strengthening of cortical network connectivity in resting-state, as well as the statistically significant increase of both network’s global efficiency and transitivity and the statistically significant decrease of the network’s characteristic path length. The cortical alterations due to the intervention triggers the network’s reorganization. The induced complexity is plausibly a positive result, given the simplified organization of DS functional network. Also, the cognitive and physical capacity of DS people were enhanced after the intervention.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computerized study that points out amelioration to the cognitive and physical skills of people with DS combined with EEG evidence of neuroplastic utility. These results are promising for the improvement of daily life and a higher level of independence that can be induced by training to the DS population.

Τα αποτeλέσματα της παρέμβασης προέκυψαν μέσω της σύγκρισης των σωματομeτρικών, των γνωστικών eκτιμήσeων, των πeντάλeπτων EEG καταγραφών σe κατάσταση ηρeμίας και των δeκαπeνταλeπτων EEG καταγραφών μe το παράδeιγμα της μουσικής αναντιστοιχίας που λήφθηκαν πριν και μeτά την παρέμβαση. Από τις αναλύσeις προέκυψαν τόσο η βeλτίωση των γνωστικών και σωματικών ικανοτήτων των ατόμων μe Σύνδρομο Down όσο και EEG στοιχeία που υποστηρίζουν την αξιοποίηση της eγκeφαλικής νeυροπλαστικότητας. Συγκeκριμένα, οι αναλύσeις των EEG έδeιξαν την eνίσχυση της συνδeσιμότητας του φλοιικού δικτύου σe κατάσταση ηρeμίας, όπως eπίσης τη στατιστικά σημαντική αύξηση της αποτeλeσματικότητας (global efficiency) και της μeταβατικότητας (transitivity) του δικτύου καθώς και της στατιστικά σημαντικής μeίωσης του μήκους μονοπατιού (characteristic path length) του δικτύου. Οι φλοιϊκές αλλαγές των ατόμων μe DS φαίνeται να οδήγησαν στην αναδιοργάνωσή του και στην απόκτηση μιας πιο πολύπλοκης δομής, γeγονός που μπορeί να θeωρηθeί θeτικό δeδομένης της απλοϊκής οργάνωσης του φλοιικού δικτύου των ατόμων μe DS. Οι αλλαγές αυτές, πιθανώς, αντικατοπτρίζουν τη βeλτίωση των γνωστικών και των σωματικών ικανοτήτων, καθιστώντας τη παρέμβαση μια πολλά υποσχόμeνη μέθοδο στον τομέα της υγeιονομικής πeρίθαλψης του πληθυσμού μe DS.",

        "abstract": "Ivon Agesti, Afifah Kusumadara S.H., LLM., SJD,, Diah Pawestri M S.H, M.H. Fakultas Hukum, Universitas Brawijaya ivonagesti@gmail.com ABSTRAK Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui bagaimana perlindungan hukum pengguna aplikasi game online terkait data pribadi dan virtual property yang ada pada aplikasi game online . di Indonesia belum ada pengaturan mengenai perlindungan data pribadi dan virtual property secara khusus. Game Online merupakan salah satu sistem elektronik yang hanya dapat digunakan dengan perangkat elektronik. Pada saat ini game online bukan hanya suatu permainan, namun juga wadah berbisnis bagi penyeda jasa aplikasi game online . Penelitian ini dilatar belakangi dengan adanya permasalahan yang muncul terkait kegagalan perlindungan data pribadi dan virtual property yang dimiliki pengguna aplikasi game online . Dengan tidak adanya peraturan perundang – undangan yang mengatur keduanya secara khusus, pengguna aplikasi game online tidak memiliki perlindungan yang memiliki hukum tetap jika terjadi kerugian akibat kegagalan perlidungan tersebut. Adapun jenis penelitian pada penelitian ini yaitu yuridis normatif dengan metode pendekatan perundang – undangan yang digunakan untuk menganalisis beberapa peraturan perundang – undangan yang masih berkaitan dengan data pribadi dan virtual property , pendekatan kasus digunakan karena banyaknya permasalahan yang muncul akibat kegagalan perlindungan data pribadi dan virtual property pengguna aplikasi game online , dan  pendekatan konseptual digunakan untuk memberikan pengertian-pengertian hukum, konsep hukum, maupun asas hukum yang relevan dengan permasalahan. Bahan hukum pimer dan sekunder. Teknik analisis data menggunakan penafsiran gramatikal dan penafsiran ekstensif. Berdasarkan penelitian ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa kebijakan privasi yang dimiliki oleh perusahaan Moonton atas aplikasi game online “Mobile Legends : BangBang“ sesuai dengan ketentuan pada pasal 28 Peraturan Menteri Nomor 20 tahun 2016 tentang Perlindungan data Pribadi Sistem Elektronik mengenai kewajiban penyelenggara sistem elektronik. Selain itu virtual property merupakan benda bergerak tidak berwujud yang termasuk benda yang diatur dalam hukum kebendaan di Indonesia, maka dari itu berlaku peraturan perundang – undangan yang melindungi benda di Indonesia. Kata Kunci : Perlindungan Hukum, Game Online , Data Pribadi, Virtual Property ABSTRACT This research is aimed to figure out how the legal protection is provided for online game application users over private data and virtual property contained in the application. In Indonesia, there is no regulation specifically made for private data and virtual property. These days online games are not only restricted to enjoyment, but they serve as a room for game application providers to earn money. This research was conducted based on existing issue over failure to provide protection for private data and virtual property of game online users. Due to the absence of the regulation specifically regulating both the private data and virtual property, the application users are left with no protection and no permanent legal force that guarantees the users in case of failure of the protection. This research employed normative juridical method along with statute approach that was aimed to analyse several laws and regulations regarding private data and virtual property; case approach was linked to existing issues regarding failure in providing protection for the private data and virtual property; and the conceptual approach to provide legal understanding, legal concept, or legal principle relevant to the issue. The legal materials involved both primary and secondary data, all of which were analysed with grammatical and extensive interpretations. The research result concludes that policy regulating the privacy held by Moonton regarding its online game application “Mobile Legends: BangBang” complies with the provision of Article 28 of Minister Regulation Number 20 of 2016 concerning protection for private data in Electronic System regarding the responsibility of electronic system providers. Moreover, virtual property is intangible moveable object as regulated in existing law in Indonesia. Therefore, regulation concerning protection for properties in Indonesia applies.

        "title": "Análisis del discurso de un docente de L2 que es percibido positivamente : estudio de caso",
        "abstract": "The role of the teacher has been acknowledged by how much of an influence they can have on the lives of their students, at any stage of the academic cycle. This phenomenon can be appreciated in Javeriana university’s B.A in Modern Languages given that during the program the students attend classes of many different teachers; some of which have a positive impact on their students, while others have a negative impact that can even affect the students’ attitude towards the subject. After a series of surveys, it was observed that among the teachers who produce the most impact in the LLM, a French teacher was highlighted for his positive influence, he later became the case study of this research; Thus, this study aimed to recognize the characteristics of this teacher's discourse, which is perceived positively by the majority of the students. \n \nFor the study of this teacher’s Pedagogical Discourse (Ramirez, 2004), Discourse Analysis (Calsamiglia and Tuson, 2001) was used as the main tool. This analysis was made through the Theory of Speech Acts (Austin, 1962, Searle, 1969), using direct, assertive and expressive speech acts as reference points to establish a structure or pattern in the teacher’s discourse. Moreover, using the Perception theory (Bruner, 1988, Gregory, 1970, Salgueiro, 1999), we sought to identify through the students' opinions the different reasons why this discourse impacts them in a positive way. \n \nAs a qualitative research and case study, the main instruments used in the obtaining of results were class recordings and interviews with the participants. From this it was found that in the teacher’s speech, assertive speech acts prevail in over 50%, directive acts were seen less frequently and expressive acts occupied an extremely low percentage of the total. However, from their perception, most of the students were sure that expressive acts were the most seen in the speech. Thus, it was concluded that characterizing the pedagogic discourse through a single concept, such as speech acts, and with students’ perception presents a challenge, since perception is a very broad concept that depends on both physical and emotional variables.",

Though there are some available published work about LLMs, the explanation of model building process and the theoretical background are not adequate. Furthermore, research about the application of the LLM theory and the selection procedure of the best model are handful. Therefore, this manuscript aims to fill that vacuum. At first, the construction of LLM and Hierarchical Log-Linear Models (HLLMs), a branch of LLMs are discussed in connection with both 2 × 2 and 2 × 2 × 2 contingency tables. Secondly, an application is presented to analyze the collected data set about the academic performance of elementary students.

        "title": "Interviews with Library Directors Suggest That Political Capital is Linked to Reputation",
        "abstract": "A Review of: \nO'Bryan, C. R. (2018). The influence of political capital on academic library leadership. Library Leadership & Management, 34(4). Retrieved from https://journals.tdl.org/llm/index.php/llm/article/view/7292 \nAbstract \nObjective – To understand how library directors use political capital to overcome challenges and reach goals in their libraries. The author defines political capital as social power that is amassed through reputation and alliance building. This social power can be used to influence decisions and change at an organizational level. \nDesign – Narrative interview. \nSetting – A large state university system in the Northeastern United States of America. The system includes a network of 64 independent campuses serving different communities with a total population of 460,000 undergraduate and 420,000 graduate students. \nSubjects – 12 library directors from within a single state university system. \nMethods – The author conducted in-depth narrative interviews with participants focusing on critical incidents throughout their careers and recent events. The author used restorying, reorganizing the data into chronological order before coding, and thematic analysis, using a software program to code the data and then revisit all the data with finalized codes to make any adjustments. \nMain Results – Several themes emerged in the interview data including interactions with administration, methods for building political capital, applying and using political capital, and building reputation. Within the interactions with administration theme, the author observed a strong connection in the hierarchy of the institution. Directors expected a high level of engagement and support from their direct reports and felt that providing this type of work to University administration would provide a return on investment for the library in terms of budget and support for new efforts or HR challenges. The theme of administrative turnover emerged as a possible barrier to establishing this relationship. In terms of building political capital, most participants did not set out to do this purposefully but instead sought to develop a reputation as a \"team player\" willing to participate in campus-wide initiatives and who would return positive outcomes. Participants expressed that it was difficult to know how much political capital they had acquired until they attempted to use it towards a goal. Eight of the participants provided narratives that included applying and using political capital, with two reporting that their political capital diminished after they had applied it towards a goal. Other participants suggested that applying political capital increased their store when it was spent toward accomplishing higher-profile goals. The importance of communication was clear in the building reputation theme, several participants indicated that their communication skills helped establish a reputation for competence and credibility in interactions both up and down the chain of command. Communication was a key factor in developing relationships across the institution, particularly with high-level administrators, and developing relationships was another area of importance for participants. \nTwo of the participants indicated that they had and used political capital in specific areas and for smaller, day-to-day changes. Eight participants used their political capital for bigger initiatives, such as budget, human resources, and library space. \nConclusion – While a few of the directors explicitly linked their activities to political capital and felt that applying their political capital increased their standing with stakeholders, most participants did not generally link the development of political capital to individual events. Instead, they suggested that generally establishing reputation and trust through excellent communication and relationship building would help them achieve success toward their goals.",

It introduces the changes brought about by the MiFID II/MiFIR legislative regime which aims to create a more efficient, transparent and integrated Financial Market that will bring the EU closer to its goal regarding the Single European Market, a target which inspires the writer to elaborate on firstly the path to be followed until its adoption, referring to the ISD, the subsequent adoption of the FSAP and the Lamfalussy legislative process, and on how they contribute to the adoption of the MiFID I; secondly on the MiFID I, which was the first complete legal regime to pursue the above goal and lay the foundations for the MiFID II/MiFIR; and third on the MiFID II/MiFIR legislative regime which is a creation/outcome of the technological development and the financial crisis of 2008, analyzing the key changes that were introduced on the market structure and transparency, on the level of investor protection, on how it adapted to the technological developments and on the strengthening of the supervisory authorities’ powers, finally quoting hers (the writer`s) thoughts & suggestions on the MiFID’s II/MiFIR’s development & on its current effect. At this point, I would like to thank my supervisor Professor Thomas Papadopoulos, a truly charismatic and inspirational professor, whose advice was valuable for completing my work and with whom it would be an honor to cooperate in the future. I would also like to thank my fellow students, already friends, for a remarkable cooperation and of course my University for its contribution throughout my studies.

        "abstract": "\n \n \n Achalasia is at present classified in 3 manometric patterns. Pattern III is the most unfrequent pattern and is correlated with the worst outcome after all available treatments. We aimed to investigate the final outcome after classic laparoscopic myotomy (CLM) as compared with a longer laparoscopic myotomy both downwards and upwards with (LLM) in patients with pattern III achalasia.\n \n \n \n The study population consisted of 61 consecutive patients with pattern III achalasia who underwent laparoscopic myotomy between 1997-2017. Patients who had already been treated with surgical or endoscopic procedures were ruled out. Symptoms were collected and scored using a detailed questionnaire; barium-swallow, endoscopy, manometry were performed, before and after surgical treatment. In CLM the total length of the myotomy was ≤ 9 cm, while myotomies extended both downwards and upwards to a length >9 cm were defined as LLM.\n \n \n \n Of the 61 patients representing the study population, 24 had CLM and 37 had LLM. In addition, all the patients add an anterior, partial fundoplication (Dor). The patients’ demographic and clinical parameters (sex, symptom-score, duration of symptoms, esophageal-diameter) were similar in both groups. One mucosal perforation was detected and repaired intraoperatively in the LLM group. The median length of the myotomy was 8 cm (IQR:8-9) in the CLM and 10 cm (IQR:10-12) in the LLM (p<0.001). The median of follow-up was 94 months (IQR:52-126) in the CLM and 24 months (IQR:16-40) in the LLM.\n As a whole, the two groups had a different drop in their symptom score: 22 (17-26) versus 4 (0-8), and 20 (18-27) versus 3 (0-6) for the CLM and LLM respectively (p<0.01). Moreover, failures were 8/24 (33.3%) in the CLM and 4/37 (10.8%) in the LLM (p<0.05). An abnormal acid exposure was detected after the treatment in 4 patients of CLM and in 3 of LLM (p=n.s.).\n \n \n \n The extension of the length of the myotomy both downwards and upwards improves the final outcome of the laparoscopic Heller-Dor procedure in patients with pattern III achalasia. On the other hand, a longer myotomy does not influence the development of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux.\n",

Bullying in schools has persisted despite the various intervention measures taken to curtail the phenomenon. The purpose of this phenomenological exploration was to explore how teachers and principals at a U.S. middle school perceive the school’s existing bullying programs and elicit recommendations about how to improve the programs. The theoretical basis of this investigation was Bandura’s social learning theory. Data were collected through interviews with 4 principles and 6 teachers. Interview data were transcribed, and then coded and analyzed using a modified Van Kaam procedure, as revised by Moustakas. Nine themes emerged from the data analysis that encompassed participants’ perceptions of the causes of bullying and how teachers and principals can help to prevent bullying. The key finding is that teachers reported that more professional training to reduce bullying is needed. Additionally, social learning theory is explanatory of participant experiences as they noted that encouraging positive behavior, kindness, and empathy in the classroom will help minimize bullying conduct in schools. This study may foster societal change by providing insight to educational leaders about how to improve antibullying programs, which may lead to reductions in school dropout rates, incidents of homicide and suicide as a result of school bullying, and other antisocial behaviors associated with school bullying.School bullying has become a serious issue in U.S. schools, with children being harassed, hurt, and even killed or driven to suicide or homicide as a result of being bullied.

Nevertheless, limited research attention has been given to the second language (L2) learning of students with SEN in special schools and even less to their L2 learning motivation (LLM), despite the significant role of LLM in L2 learning success. This paper compares LLM data gathered from 66, grade 7-10, students with SEN in a special school and 66, grade 7-10, non-SEN students from mainstream schools in Hong Kong. Findings from a motivational questionnaire reveal higher levels of LLM among the special school students (SSS) than the mainstream school students (MSS). One-way MANOVA and Cohen’s d, show students from the special school have significantly higher Ought-to L2 Self and English learning attitude yet significantly lower required orientation than their mainstream school peers. Regression analysis has allowed the investigation of factors interacting with SSS’ LLM, suggesting that self-efficacy and parental influence are significant predictors of the LLM.",

Kata Kunci: Alasan Hakim, Justice Collaborator , Tindak Pidana Korupsi ABSTRACT This research starts from different grounds of judges in two decisions Number 100/PID.SUSTPK/2017/PN.Jkt.Pst from District Court of Jakarta and Number 5/PID.SUSTPK/2018/PT.DKI from High Court of Capital City, where the former decided the defendant as justice collaborator and the latter revoked the defendantâ€™s status. Embarking from this difference, this research presents the following research problems: (1) What is the basic consideration of the judges in deciding the defendant as justice collaborator? (2) What is the basic consideration in revoking the status of the defendant as justice collaborator in the latter decision? (3) Based on what criteria did the judge decide the defendant as justice collaborator? This research was conducted based on Normative-juridical method with statute and case approaches. The research data comprised primary and secondary data obtained from legislation, court decisions, literature, journals, and theses. From the above method, this research reveals that: (1) the basic consideration of the judge regarding the Decision Number 100/PID.SUS-TPK/2017/PN.Jkt.Pst outlines that 1. The defendant admitted his guilt, b. the defendant reveals another suspect. (2) The basic consideration of the judge regarding the Decision Number 5/PID.SUSTPK/2018/TPK/2018/PT.DKI: a. the defendant played a significant role b. the defendant was the main actor of the crime, (3) the defendant was as justice collaborator because the defendant was: a. one of others involved in the crime, b. admitted his guilt, c. was not the main actor of the crime, d. testified as a witness at court, e. testified and provided evidence useful for enquiry based on General Prosecutors, f. disclosed other suspects playing bigger roles, g. returned assets earned from the criminal act.

Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with 3 treatments and 5 replications. The Lamtoro Leaf Meal (LLM) (50 gram) was blended in NaOH (200 ml) for 15 menit and centrifuged to separate the supernatant from extracted LLM. The extracted LLM was re-extracted with buffer acetat pH 4,6 and sentrifuged again to separate supernantant from extracted LLM. Both supernatant from NaOH and buffera acetat pH 4,6 extraction were mixed and precipitated with buffer phospat until isoelectric point. The treatments were tested consisted of extracted with NaOH pH 8, NaOH pH 9 and NaOH pH 10. The parameters measured; isoelectric point at precipited, crude protein, total amino acid (TAA), total essential amino acid (TEAA) and individual amino acid. The results showed that the precipited obtained isoelectric point pH 7 was 2.66; 1.03 and 2.58 gram at the extraction treatments using NaOH at pH 8, 9 and 10, respectively. LPCL extracted using NaOH at pH 9 and 10 contained a high crude protein of 54.82 and 52.60% higher than the extraction using NaOH at pH 8 of 46.98%. The total amount of amino acid and essential amino acid (AAE) of LPCL were highest in treatment using NaOH at pH 10 of 26,58; 13.31 %, respectively. Combination extraction LLM using pH buffer 10 followed by re-extract using acetate buffer pH 4,6 contains crude protein and good essential amino acid, especially leucine.

        "abstract": "Objective To study the relation of epileptological and surgical variables with post-operative memory performance, following surgery for refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) due to hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Methods Logical memory (LM) and visual memory (VM) scores for immediate and late recall of 201 patients operated for MTLE/HS from 1996 to 2016 were reviewed. All patients were evaluated prior to surgery and reevaluated up until 5 years after the procedure. Scores were standardized to a control group of 54 healthy individuals matched for age and education. Patients were divided in two groups according to the hemisphere affected and scores for immediate and late recall were compared. Reliable Change Index (RCI) with a 90% confidence interval was performed to verify individual memory changes for each late LM (lLM) and late VM (lVM) score. A multiple linear regression was performed with the RCI using late recall scores of lLM and lVM and clinical variables. Results 112 (56%) patients had left HS (lHS). The lHS group showed decreased immediate LM (iLM) scores before and after surgery (p<0.05), compared with rHS. The rHS group showed increased iLM scores post-operatively (p<0.05). RCI of the rHS group showed that 6 (7%) individuals had improved, 78 (87%) stabilized and 5 (6%) decresead in lLM scores, and for lVM 7 (8%) improved, 80 (89%) stabilized and 2 (3%) worsened (RCI> 1.645). RCI of the lHS group showed that 3 (3%) individuals had increased scores, 104 (93%) stabilized and 5 (4%) worsened for lLM, and for lVM 3 (3%) obtained improved scores, 103 (92%) stabilized and 6 (5%) decreased (RCI> 1.645). lHS and later age of onset of the first epileptic seizure were predictors of lLM loss (p<0.05). Conclusion Left MTLE/HS and later age of seizure onset were predictive factors for worsening of lLM. No RCI predictors of post-op lVM performance were identified. We found a decreased baseline functioning of LM in the lHS group and improvement of LM in some patients who had resection of the right MTL. Patients of the rHS group had a higher percentage of reliable post-op improvement for both VM and LM scores.",

ABSTRACT The interruption in the administration of justice is one of the main hurdles to the creation of tribunals. Due to the pendency of cases in different courts, domestic tribunals and other tribunals, specific laws have been created to resolve the situation that arose. In the legal perspective, a' tribunal' is different from a national tribunal. The' domestic tribunal' refers to administrative agencies designed to control professional behavior and impose discipleship among members through the exercise of investigative and adjudicative powers. Whereas, tribunals are the quasi-judicial bodies set up to adjudicate disputes relating to specified matters exercising jurisdiction under the statute that establishes them. However, while expressing concern over the enormous pendency of appeals against orders by different tribunals in the country, the Supreme Court had asked the Law Commission to examine whether tribunalisation obstructed the effective functioning of the apex tribunal. The Law Commission submitted its 272nd Report on 'Assessment of Legislative Frameworks of Tribunals in India' after it had been requested by the Supreme Court in Gujrat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd. v. Essar Power Ltd to find changes to be made with regard to the legislative structure of various tribunals and the process and conditions for the appointment of Chairpersons and Members to these tribunals This paper goes through a summary of the tribunals ' past, their operation and program disadvantages. It also does an update on the law commission's 272nd survey.",

During the process of production, we faced some borderline issues regarding our unauthorized uses of others’ copyright works. When we put ourselves into the copyright's author's shoes, three problems arose regarding our use of possible limitations and exceptions: the lack of guidance; the fear of liability; and the unharmonized status of limitations and exceptions at an international level. This article examines these problems from a copyright policy perspective and invites documentary festivals to undertake a mission of guiding new documentary directors through the complex, unharmonized world of copyright limitations and exceptions.",

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya muhammadridwan_42@yahoo.com ABSTRAK Lisensi konten terbuka Hak Cipta merupakan suatu sarana izin yang dapat digunakan oleh pemegang Hak Cipta untuk memberikan pernyataan bahwa konten ciptaannya bisa digunakan ulang seacara bebas oleh pihak lain. Lisensi konten terbuka merupakan fasilitas untuk mempermudah pemberian izin dari pemegang Hak Cipta yang selama ini dianggap rumit dan mahal. Penggunaan ulang lisensi konten terbuka telah marak dilakukan di Indonesia dan kegiatan ini tentunya dapat mengurangi pelanggaran Hak Cipta, karena itu perlu adanya peraturan yang spesifik mengatur mengenai lisensi konten terbuka, karena secara spesifik lisensi konten terbuka berbeda dengan lisensi dasar Hak Cipta dan tidak dapat mengikuti ketentuan yang ada. Penelitian hukum ini membahas tentang kekuatan hukum serta urgensi dari pengaturan lisensi konten terbuka Hak Cipta di Indonesia. Untuk menjawab permasalahan tersebut, penelitian hukum normatif ini menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan dan pendekatan komparatif. Berdasarkan pembahasan, maka dapat disimpulkan: 1) Kekuatan hukum lisensi konten terbuka di Indonesia adalah mengikat dan berlaku terhadap pihak-pihak yang mengikatkan diri dalam perjanjian, tetapi tidak mempunyai akibat hukum terhadap pihak ketiga karena tidak dicatatkan, dan 2) Urgensi dari pengaturan lisensi konten terbuka dikarenakan di Negara Amerika tidak membebani lisensi dengan kewajiban pencatatan serta telah ada yurisprudensi yang melindungi hak pemegang Hak Cipta yang kontennya sudah dilisensikan dengan lisensi konten terbuka. Sedangkan, di Negara India Undang-Undang Hak Ciptanya memberikan ruang untuk lisensi konten terbuka sehingga dapat diadaptasikan pada negaranya.

ABSTRACT Free content license of copyright is understood as a permit that can be used by copyright holder to issue a statement that the content can be used repeatedly and for free by other parties. The license of free content is intended to give easier access to permit from copyright holder, and such a permit has been so far deemed costly and complicated. The principle of this free content license is based on a simple principle that does not require any specific royalty. This is specifically different from the basic license of copyright it cannot follow the existing regulation of license registration. This legal research discusses the legal consequences and the relevance of the provision of license registration to free content license. This research was conducted based on statute approach. It can be learned from the research result that 1) the agreement of free content license in Indonesia is binding and it applies for all parties bound to the agreement, but this agreement is not binding for the third party since it is unregistered, and 2) the provision of the license registration is found irrelevant to free content license since free content license is used worldwide and, thus, it is not in line with the rule in which Indonesian has to be used in the license of copyrights. This irrelevance is also obvious in the provision concerning elements that must not be included in the license agreement. Free content license in terms of shapes, characters, and names, cannot abide by the existing provisions. The provisions regarding copyright license registration are charged with payment, and they are not relevant to free content license that is committed to license use without royalty.

Berdasarkan latar belakang diatas, maka permasalahan hukum yang dapat dikemukakan dalam penelitian ini adalah bagaimana pelaksanaan pasal 86 Undang –Undang No 18 Tahun 2014 Tentang Kesehatan jiwa dan apakah kendala yang dialami POLRES Malang dalam Melaksanakan Pasal 86 undang-Undang No. 18 Tahun 2014 Tentang Kesehatan Jiwa. Untuk menjawab masalah tersebut maka metode yang penulis gunakan adalah menggunakan metode penelitian hukum yuridis empiris. Berdasarkan pembahasan  maka dapat disimpulkan, kepolisian resort Malang belum dapat melaksanakan pemidanaan terhadap pelaku pemasungan di wilayah hukum Kabupaten Malang sesuai dengan pasal 86 Undang-Undang No 18 Tahun 2014 Tentang Kesehatan Jiwa, karena penyidik belum mengetahui ketentuan hukum tersebut serta belum adanya laporan dari masyarakat mengenai tindak pidana pemasungan yang terjadi di lingkungan nya. Kepolisian resort Malang mendapat kendala untuk melaksanakan pasal 86 Undang-undang No. 18 Tahun 2014 Tentang Kesehatan Jiwa yakni kurang nya pengetahuan penyidik terhadap ketentuan hukum pemidanaan pelaku pemasungan, kurang nya pengetahuan dan budaya hukum masyarkat, serta kurang sinerginya antara instansi-instansi yang memiliki kewenangan dalam menangani kasus pemasungan di Kabupaten Malang.

This issue raises the question how is the Article 86 of Act Number 18 of 2014 concerning Mental Health implemented and what impeding factors are faced by the Sub-Regional Police Department (POLRES) of Malang in the implementation of the law? To resolve the research problems, empirical juridical method was employed. The research concludes that the police department cannot impose the punishment on the person delivering the stocks punishment in the jurisdiction of Malang regency according to Article 86 concerning Mental Health because the enquirer has not figured out the provision of law and because there is no report coming from the society concerning the delivery of this punishment. Some impeding factors get in the way to the implementation of the law where there is lack of knowledge about the law that should be imposed on the stocks punishment and lack of knowledge, lack of the culture of law in society, and lack of synergy among institutions that hold authorities to handle the case in Malang Regency. Keywords : the stocks, punishment, Act concerning Mental Health",

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Devandaypu13@yahoo.com ABSTRAK Penyebaran praktik usaha bahan bakar minyak digital elektrik (Pertamini) di Indonesia sangat lah cepat. Hal ini dikarenakan terobosan usaha tersebut nyatanya dapat membantu penyebaran dan pendistribusian bahan bakar minyak sampai ke pelosok-pelosok daerah. Tentu saja apabila tidak dibarengi dengan regulasi dan pengawasan terkait, kegiatan usaha tersebut tidak dapat berjalan secara maksimal serta pemerintah tidak akan mendapat keuntungan. Pertamini tentu saja membutuhkan dukungan dari pemerintah berupa izin dan regulasi untung menyosong keberlangsungan kegiatan usaha tersebut. Penelitian hukum ini membahas tentang konsistensi pengawasan pemerintah terhadap pelaku usaha bahan bakar minyak digital elektrik (Pertamini) dan bagaimana seharusnya konsep yang ideal dalam mengawasi pelaku usaha bahan bakar minyak digital elektrik (Pertamini). Untuk menjawab permasalahan tersebut, penelitian hukum normative ini menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan, pendekatann konseptual serta pendekatan kasus. Berdasarkan pembahasan, maka dapat disimpulkan: 1) Tidak diaturnya perihal bentuk pengawasan yang dilakukan oleh pemerintah terhadap pelaku usaha Pertamini, oleh sebab itu penulis berusaha menghubungkannya dengan pengaturan yang dimiliki oleh Pertamina, dan 2) Idealnya pengawasan pemerintah terhadap pelaku usaha Pertamini harus diawasi oleh seluruh elemen pemerintahan, lalu pengawasan tersebut sebaiknya dilakukan secara berkala dan sebaiknya pemerintah membentuk tim/divisi baru yang secara khusus bertugas untuk mengawasi kegiatan usaha Pertamini. Kata Kunci: Pengawasan Pemerintah, Pelaku Usaha, Pertamini. ABSTRACT The growing business practices of Pertamini in Indonesia are quite massive because this breakthrough is seen capable of helping the distribution and marketing of oil and gas and it manages to reach remote areas. Without regulation and related supervision, this form of business practices will not optimally take place and the government will not gain any benefit. The Pertamini surely requires government support in terms of the license and regulation concerning profit for the sustainability of the business. This legal research discusses the consistency of government supervision over business actors in digital electronic gas station (Pertamini) and what ideal concept that can be applied to supervise the business actors concerned. To give answer to the research problems, statute, conceptual, and case approaches were employed. The research result reveals: 1) since the form of supervision from the government is not regulated, the author aims to relate it with the regulation set by Pertamina, and 2) principally, government supervision over the business actors concerned must be under supervision that involves all governmental elements, which should be imposed regularly. Moreover, it is essential that the government establish a team specifically intended to supervise the business practices of pertamini. Keywords : government regulation, business actors, Pertamini",

Analysis of the regulation concerning foreign workers was also performed for more ideal and relevant concept of legal protection for Indonesian workers in Indonesia, which is intended to gain legal certainty. The shift in the regulation from 1958 to 2018 was deemed significant, where it was found out that the shift involved the improvement in the administration, which is aimed for easier administrative process, and the abolishment of several norms to more strictly filter the entering foreign workers to Indonesia. As a consequence, the norm reflecting legal protection for Indonesian workers based on the 1945 Indonesian Constitution is required, in which the norm should restrict the frequency of the employment of foreign workers; Indonesian workers must always be involved in the sectors that employ foreign workers; the job available for Indonesian co-worker should remain guaranteed even after the working period of the foreign workers ends; the provisions of IMTA (permit to employ foreign workers) must be returned; foreign workers must be proficient in bahasa Indonesia; foreign works must transfer their skills to Indonesian workers in statement and they also have to pass medical check-up and feasibility test supported by field verification; issuance of IMTA must involve related ministry; IDR must be used in every transaction and sanction must be imposed.

Menjadi beban konsumen dengan adanya klausula tersebut, karena seharusnya beban tersebut dipikul oleh produsen, sehingga sangat merugikan konsumen karena biasanya konsumen memiliki posisi yang lemah dibandingkan dengan produsen. Pada prinsipnya penetapan klausula eksonerasi (Pengalihan Tanggung jawab) dalam perjanjian baku dilarang oleh Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen, terdapat pada Pasal 18 Ayat 1 Huruf a yang menyatakan bahwa tidak boleh adanya pengalihan Tanggung jawab. Lalu dilengkapi dengan pasal 18 Ayat (3) Undang-Undang Perlindungan konsumen menyatakan jika dalam perjanjian baku yang dikeluarkan oleh pelaku usaha tidak memenuhi ketentuan yang di maksud dalam pasal 18 ayat (1) dan (2) maka akan dinyatakan batal demi hukum. Dinyatakan batal demi hukum yang dimaksudkan adalah “dari semula dianggap tidak pernah ada dilahirkan suatu perjanjian dan tidak pernah ada suatu perikatan”.

Kata kunci : Perjanjian Baku, Klausula Eksonerasi, Perlindungan Konsumen, Asas Proporsionalitas, Pelaku Usaha, Konsumen ABSTRACT Exoneration clause often found in an agreement as a supplementary clause with esensialia element of an agreement is usually in the form of a normative agreement. However, the clause has been a burden for consumers, and his shlould have been the responsibility of producers. The consumers are disadvantaged since they are in weaker position than producers. Principally, the stipulation of the exoneration clause (concering responsibility transfer) in a normative agreement is not allowed by the law on consumer protection, and it is regulated in Article 18 Paragraph 1 Letter a stating that no responsibility transfer is allowed. This regulation is supported by Article 18 Paragraph (3) of Act concerning Consumers Protection stating that the substance in the normative agreement failing to meet Article 18 Paragraph (1) and (2) is deemed invalid from the outset. In other words, no agreement is deemed existing. However, in the practice, agreement under which a new bank account is opened in BCA, BNI and Bank Jatim does not always have to be declared invalid from the outset. Article 18 Paragraph 1 Letter A does not clearly provide details over the scope of the responsibility that can be transferred by a business owner.

        "abstract": "This dissertation was written as part of the LLM in Transnational and European Commercial Law, Banking Law, Arbitration/Mediation at the International Hellenic University. The global financial crisis of the late 2000s has been the subject of much debate and analysis. The crisis of 2007-2008 had a massive impact on banks and financial institutions as well as the way in which they were regulated. The beginning of the 'trouble' can be traced back to 2007, when a downturn in the United States real estate market fuelled the crisis around the world. The deep integration of global banking, funding and securities markets were the key parameters which led to the spread of the US recession, affecting many European states. Clearly, the most large financial institutions failed to measure and manage the risks to which they were exposed, while the public authorities were proved to be ill-equipped to deal adequately with bank crises. The financial crisis demonstrated the need for closing the gaps and weaknesses in the system for bank regulation and supervision, demanding a better legal framework. The response to the crisis by the US and European authorities was significant and unprecedented. The passing of the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010, the biggest reform in the US since the Great Depression, was a timely reflection of the need to promote financial stability and to protect US economy from any abusive financial services practices. Similarly, the European authorities introduced the European Banking Union aimed at providing future guarantees for eurozone banking system, and especially the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive as a legislative measure to harmonize and improve the tools for dealing with future bank crises. This paper aims to clearly illustrate the resolution scheme and specifically the resolution tools that are able to be applied to the financial institutions which are failing or likely to fail under the Dodd-Frank Act and the BRRD. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my professor and dissertation supervisor Dr. Thomas Papadopoulos for his support, comments and sharing his time so generously to discuss the topics of my dissertation. I wish to thank my family for being my biggest support during the process of writing this dissertation. I am also grateful to the academic and administrative members of the International Hellenic University for their help and support in my academic path.",

Электронная почта: admitrieva@eu.spb.ru \nВ статье исследуется организация процесса отбора и назначений судей в России. Обсуждаются его основные институциальные механизмы, установившиеся после реформ 1990-х гг. Во-первых, анализируется организация работы квалификационных коллегий судей, а также роль председателей судов в формировании судейского корпуса. Во-вторых, изучаются особенности профессиональной модели отбора судей, основанной на меритократических принципах выбора наиболее квалифицированных юристов, и бюрократической модели, в которой карьера судьи выстраивается непосредственно после окончания вуза. Эмпирический анализ базируется на исследовании 957 биографий кандидатов в судьи, опубликованных на портале квалификационной коллегии в 2014–2015 гг. Анализ биографий показывает, что кандидаты в судьи преимущественно женщины, 70 % кандидатов получали юридический опыт в аппарате суда. Для моделирования результатов назначения на должность в статье используется логистический регрессионный анализ. Результаты анализа выявили несколько закономерностей. Первое – в отборе на должность судьи определенную роль играют меритократические факторы, в частности, небольшое преимущество получают кандидаты с хорошим юридическим образованием. Второе – анализ показывает, что безусловный приоритет в отборе отдается кандидатам, получившим опыт работы в государственном секторе (в аппарате судов, прокуратуре и органах госуправления). Напротив, те, кто работали юристами в бизнес-организациях или адвокатуре, реже получают рекомендации квалификационных коллегий. Наконец, ключевую роль в отборе судей играют председатели судов. Ходатайство председателя суда повышает шансы кандидата получить рекомендацию на должность в 1,5 раза. Это оказываетсущественное влияние на структуру судейского корпуса, формирует профессиональную бюрократическую культуру и снижает независимость судебной власти.",

STFM is a collaborative organization composed of members who are dedicated to teaching the discipline to learners of any level. The conference brings together members including physicians, administrators, behavioral scientists, researchers, residents, and students to learn from one another and improve the quality of family medicine education in the United States and Canada. Abstracts for all conference submissions can be found on the STFM website.1 Plenary speakers addressed topics related to health equity (Joanne Rooney, JD, LLM, EdD); discrimination and bias in the medical workplace (Roberto E. Montenegro, MD, PhD); and mentoring in family medicine (Beat Steiner, MD, MPH, STFM President). The STFM Committee on Medical Student Education reviewed the 14 completed educational research projects and selected six exemplary abstracts as the best of the conference. Criteria for inclusion included relevance to medical student education with a focus on family medicine education, study quality, and meaningful conclusions. Five of the abstracts appear in this collection. One has been published in the intervening time.2.",

        "abstract": "This study aims to construct Radial Resistivity Images (RRI) and analyze petrophysical properties to aid in the characterization and imaging of the drilling fluid distribution in a pre-salt carbonate reservoir in the Santos Basin, Southeastern Brazil. From the porosity and permeability samples obtained in the laboratory, it was possible to characterize the reservoir in 6 hydraulic flow units. Then, three sections of radial resistivity were created, which were based on the resistivity (laterolog and induction) logs, which examined the resistivity variation within the reservoir in surface resistivity (LLS), mean (LLM) and depth (LLD) with the acoustic image log and the NMR log. As expected, the responses presented higher values of resistivity in the zones closer to the well wall, which occurs due to the invasion of the drilling mud, since these layers present values of porosity and permeability in laboratory tests varying from 2 to 20%",

Letak Geografis yang stategis membuat Indonesia sering dilalui sebagai jalur perdagangan di era Abad 15. Tidak jarang kapal tidak sampai ke tujuan dengan beberapa permasalahan. Hanyut, perang dan kamar bisa menjadi sebab. Keuntungan yang diperoleh adalah Benda berharga asal Muatan Kapal Tenggelam (BMKT). Tercatat dari 464 titik lokasi kapal tenggelam, memiliki nilai ekonomi sekitar 127,6 Triliun. Potensi itulah yang kemudian perlu dikelola dengan baik dan benar sehingga kejadian pengangkatan Benda Muatan Kapal Tenggelam secara melawan hukum tidak terjadi lagi seperti tahun 2010. Analisis peraturan diperlukan dengan tujuan mengetahui problematika dan mengetahui permasalahan hukum yang terjadi dalam pengelolaan Benda Muatan Kapal Tenggelam. Metode Penelitian yang dipakai dalam penelitian adalah normatif dengan jenis  penelitian yuridis normatif, dan peraturan perundang-undangan sebagai pendekatan penelitian. Hasil Penelitian yang ditemukan adalah Tidak Sinkron antara Undang-Undang dan Peraturan Dibawahnya sehingga terjadi tumpang tindih antara undang-undang sekaligus pelaksanan. Selanjutnya Tidak ada aturan spesifik tentang warisan budaya bawah air dalam hal ini BMKT sehingga membuat ragu antar instansi untuk proses pengelolaan Benda Muatan Kapla Tenggelam. Dari hasil temuan yang didapat penulis, maka penulis dapat memberikan saran maka penulis dapat memberikan saran sebagai berikut: Pemerintah perlu merevisi Undang-Undang Cagar Budaya Nomor 11 Tahun 2010 dengan mengintegrasikan seluruh peraturan perundangundangan yang berkaitan dengan pelestarian warisan budaya bawah air, mengingat peraturan perundang-undangan yang ada masih mengalami tumpang tindih serta benturan antar peraturan, Menerbitkan Peraturan Pemerintah dari Undang-Undang Nomor 10 Tahun 2010 tentang Cagar Budaya agar undang-undang ini dapat berlaku efektif, Pemerintah perlu menyusun peraturan khususs mengenai warisan budaya bawah air/BMKT mengingat pengelolaan warisan budaya di darat dan dilaut berbeda.

Several ships used to trade failed to complete their journey due to being swept away be sea current, war, or even sinking. The sinkeing ships have left treasure in the bottom of the sea, where there were 464 location of sunken ships with the sunjen treasure worth as much as 127,6 trillions Rupiahs. This potensial requires proper management and lifting the sunken treasure illegally must ot take place like in 2010. Analysis on the regulation in required to find out problems and other legal issues involved in the management of sunken treasure. This article is categorised as a normative research which employrd normative judicial methods along with statue approach. The research result has found irrelevance between the law and regulation under the law, leading to overlapping of the  two regulations and their implementation. Furthermore, the absence of specific rules regarding treasure sinking to the bottom of the sea creates doubt for authorities to lift and manage the sunken treasure. The author comes with several recommendations where it is imperative that Government revise Act concerning Cultural Heritage Number 11 of 2010 by integrating all existing laws and regulation in preserving the cultural heritage found under water sice the existing regulations are overlapping and in conflict. Moreover, the Government should also issue Government Regulation stemming form Act Number 10 fo 2010 concerning Cultural Heritage. This is aimed to make the existing Act run more effectively. The Govenment should set a specific regulation concerning under water cultural heritage recalling that there is difference between the heritage found on shore and under the ocean.

        "title": "Meaningful Connectedness: A Foundation for Effective Legal Teaching",
        "abstract": "Teaching in higher education is complex – there is no singular method to being a successful educator given the many components of effective teaching. Through the lens of academic literature and the perspectives of four nationally acclaimed legal academics, whose teaching has been recognised through the Australian Awards for University Teaching (‘AAUT’), this paper explores the concept of effective legal teaching and the characteristics and approaches that make an engaging legal educator. Each of the four academics was interviewed, and analysis of their responses identified a recurrent theme – namely the importance of establishing meaningful connections with students as a basis for effective teaching. The benefits associated with the establishment of meaningful connections by academics with students in the teaching of law in higher education are identified and discussed in this paper. * LLM, LLB, BCom, GradDipLegPrac, GradCertHE, Lecturer, Curtin Law School. ** LLB (Hons), BA, Lecturer, University of Western Australia.

        "abstract": "Development of control techniques for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems to provide occupancy driven energy and comfort management has been an active area. In this study, we carried out the work on the balance between indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and energy consumption with low-dimensional linear models (LLM), artificial neural network (ANN) and contribution ratio of indoor climate (CRI) to provide support for HVAC control. In general, ventilation (pollutant) and temperature factors were both considered in the CFD simulation. Linear ventilation model (LVM) and linear temperature model (LTM) were employed to expand the CFD database. Then, combined with ANN, CRI and LLM, LLVM (low-dimensional linear ventilation model)-based ANN and LLTM (low-dimensional linear temperature model)-based CRI could rapidly predict the indoor environmental parameters. The evaluation indices were also defined to provide weightings between indoor environment and energy consumption. On this basis, the HVAC energy consumption caused by ventilation and air conditioning loads could be decreased by 50% and 16% respectively. This study will promote an intelligent HVAC control strategy for user comfort and HVAC energy conservation.",

ABSTRACT This research aims to look into the legal protection for Aroma as a brand in Indonesia according to Act Number 20 of 2016 concerning Brands and Geographical Indications. Despite the fact that this brand is recognised and protected by international agreement and branding policies effective in several countries, Indonesia has not clearly regulated the legal protection for Aroma as a brand. This research employed normative juridical method with statute and comparative approaches. The legal materials needed were obtained from documentation and literature review, analysed by applying descriptive-based analysis, followed by grammatical interpretation to help answer the issue observed. The research result reveals that Aroma, according to law regulating brands in Indonesia, Aroma cannot serve as an object of legal protection. International perspective still allows the registration of Aroma as a brand by considering distinguishing features of the product. Moreover, Indonesia has not provided any legal protection for Aroma as a brand since it tends to graphically prioritise the requirement.

ABSTRACT This research is aimed to find out and understand (1) the basis of legal consideration of the judge in Decision Number 1081 K.PID.SUS/2014 over delivering a sentence to Labora as a defendant and (2) whether the person outside organisation assigned to be in charge of corporation can still hold criminal liability. This research is categorised into a normative legal research conducted by studying exiting laws. The research result concludes as follows: (1) in terms of the relevance to the consideration of the judges, Labora is proven not doing any money laundering as based on the panel of judges, which is not in line with the charge from general prosecutors led by the Head of Office of the District Prosecutor General of Sorong, RheinSingal. The decision by the judges over the case involving LaboraSitorus as the defendant is not relevant to the theory of consideration and the decision delivered is deemed irrelevant to the existing punishment, (2) the control of corporation performed by an individual outside the organisation is linked to similar identification concept that suggests that agents or individuals in charge of corporation rely on types and structures of organisation of a corporation. This generally involves the board of directors and chief executive officer or any positions at similar level and involves determining the type of offense by referring to the term ‘whoever’ that is generally addressed to a person.

        "abstract": "This project research is focusing on the Highway Traffic Status mobile application for highway user who always been stuck in heavy traffic. By using the information about highway traffic status that has been posted in social media such as tweeter, this application will extract all the information related to highway traffic, analyze the information and display the information to end user. Even though, there is some application that already been used by the user to get the information about highway traffic statuses such as PLUS Highway Status & Rate, Plus Highway Traffic Status and LLM Traffic. All these applications are not based on real-time information, therefore, the user still facing problem to get the latest highway traffic status. To solve this problem, this project used R programming language since R programming language is one of the best programming languages that often used in data analysis. R programming language is used to extract and analyze all the data so that the user will get the latest information about highway traffic. The working prototype of this project was developed by using Android Studio since Android Studio is an officially Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Google's Android operating system. The outcome for this project is to create Highway Traffic Status mobile application that provides the latest traffic status to the user.",

        "abstract": "Due to increased traffic volume and conventional pavement designs with poorer subgrades under tropical environment and conditions, most roads are relatively over-loading and the repair or maintenance works to existing pavements become a focus. A super-fast and super-strong technology is required to strengthen the existing pavements in short period with lesser disturbances to both public traffic and operations. Chemical in-situ rehabilitation has become the trend of quick repairs in Malaysia. Chemilink systems have more than 25 years track records in tropical region, its product has been officially approved by Federal Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR) and Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia (LLM) since 2016 in JKR Material List (JMAL). This rehabilitation method can strengthen various pavement base/sub-base courses and achieve higher performances, such as California Bearing Ratio(CBR) values with more than 120% within 24 hours, it also become more popular for pavement upgrading/strengthening and maintenance in airfield and seaport too. It significantly increase overall performances and durability of various pavements with higher technical parameters, faster construction, longer working life and finally overall cost effectiveness. It can utilize the in-situ and local materials in green and sustainable manner. The application procedure include site investigation, mix-design, rehabilitation process, and immediate and long-term performances.",

        "abstract": "The Hart-Fuller debate is perhaps one of the most interesting academic debates of all times that took place in jurisprudence. It demonstrates the divide that exists between the positivist and the natural philosophy of law regarding the role of morality in law. While, Hart argued that law and morality are separate from each other and they can be termed as mutually exclusive. Fuller was of the view that there exists a deep connection between law and morality and the authority of law is derived from its consistency with morality. The researcher in this paper attempts to study the relationship that exists between law and morality with reference to Hart-Fuller debate.

        "title": "Assessment of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome Incidence and Identification of Other Correlating Risk Factors in Patients Admitted Through the Emergency Department",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this project was to measure adherence rates to the current alcohol use screening process, and identification of correlations of alcohol use and outcomes in patients admitted to Norton Hospital, via the emergency department. METHODS: The study design is a retrospective descriptive evaluation, of adherence to the current alcohol use screening process, and associations among age, gender, ethnicity, length of stay, number of ICU days, restraint use days, level of care at admission (ICU, TCU, LLM/tele, MS), incidence of AWS/DTs, and activation of the CIWA protocol among the adult inpatient population of Norton Hospital’s downtown campus, admitted via the emergency department (ED), for greater than 24 hours, between April 2016 and April 2017. The sample consisted of 300 randomly selected patient charts, using the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: It was found that overall screening adherence for alcohol use on patients admitted from the emergency room was nearly 100%. Among the study population 26.3% screened positive, 4.3% had the specific diagnosis of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, 4.7% were treated with CIWA protocol. Those who screened positive were more likely to be male, with a mean age of 49.8 years. No statistical differences in ethnicity, level of care at admission, restraint use, mortality, number of ICU days, and length of stay were found within the study sample population, between those who screened positive or negative for alcohol use at admission. CONCLUSION: Further research needs to be done to better understand associations between alcohol use screening and ethnicity, level of care at admission, restraint use, ASSESSMENT OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME viii length of stay, number of ICU days and mortality in the overall population at Norton Hospital’s downtown campus. Retrospective review revealed that there was a high level of adherence to the alcohol use screening process by the health care staff. The screening process for alcohol use at admission is well documented within those admitted via the emergency department. ASSESSMENT OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME 1 Assessment of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome Incidence and Identification of Other Correlating Risk Factors in Patients Admitted Through the Emergency Department Introduction With alcohol and substance abuse problems continuing to rise rapidly throughout our nation, we are in need of a way to ensure proper identification and treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in persons who present to the emergency department, and undergo an abrupt cessation of alcohol consumption due to an acute illness, and hospitalization. This study is designed to determine if there was adherence to an established alcohol use screening process during the time frame, ensuring that those who are at risk for the development of alcohol withdrawal syndrome are being treated with the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA) protocol, and to determine correlating risk factors and demographics. This study was designed with alignment of Neuman’s Systems Model nursing theory. Treating the patient as a fluid and dynamic being responding to their own personal environment leading to sickness and establishing health, using primary, secondary and tertiary care interventions. Focusing on the patient as a whole, with multidimensional, layers of well-being: physiological, physiochemical, psychological, sociocultural and spiritual (Petiprin, 2016). Background As the problem with alcohol abuse and other substances continues to grow exponentially throughout our nation, and in particular in the state of Kentucky, we have seen a steady rise of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) incidence within the general hospital inpatient population. Approximately 9% of the adults in the United States meet the criteria for alcohol abuse (Burns, 2015). Within the general inpatient population alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) can present in nearly 30% of patients; if left untreated AWS has a 15% mortality rate (Ungur, Neuner, John, ASSESSMENT OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME 2 Wernecke, & Spies, 2013). With early recognition and treatment, however, that mortality rate falls dramatically to 2% (Ungur et al., 2013). At the downtown campus of the 379 bed Norton Hospital in Louisville, KY, there were 16,768 inpatient admissions in 2015 (US News Health Care Report, 2016). Based on the 30% incidence of AWS in the general inpatient population, this could have left 5,030 patients at risk, or 113 patients on any given day for the development of alcohol related complications that year. By ensuring that patients are screened for alcohol use at the time of hospital admission, a primary healthcare intervention, we have the opportunity to identify patients at risk for AWS so that timely prevention and/or treatment, a secondary healthcare intervention, can occur. The abrupt cessation of alcohol intake by alcohol dependent patients puts them at risk for withdrawal, and a variety of complications. These include development of AWS, post-operative complications and infections, increased length of stay and death (Bard et al., 2006). All of which can upset the balance of the wellness continuum described by Neuman’s Systems Model. This can also cause problems for the hospital itself. For example the staff can be at risk of burnout, due to stress from caring for confused and combative patients; also it can be difficult to determine whether a patient’s confusion is due to AWS or another diagnosis, leading to increased costs and unnecessary testing (Ungar et al., 2013). In addition, the hospital is at risk for increased post-operative complication rates, increased length of stay, and increased mortality, all of which lead to increased costs, and decreased patient and provider satisfaction (Ungar et al., 2013). In 2016 alone, healthcare costs related to alcohol induced complications in the United States amounted to $21 billion (Trevejo-Nunez, Kolls, & De Wit, 2016). Currently, the screening tool for alcohol use at Norton Hospital is a yes or no question asked during the admission assessment within the admission navigator in the electronic medical ASSESSMENT OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME 3 record system EPIC. This important screening tool is not linked to prompt the provider to initiate treatment if the patient screens positive. The current standard of care treatment for AWS at Norton Hospital is utilized with the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment (CIWA). This protocol is a thorough nursing assessment done by the bedside nurse, using severity of ten symptoms of withdrawal, each tied to a number based upon level of severity. These ten numbers are then added together for an overall composite score. The composite score is then referenced for the appropriate treatment and frequency of reassessment (Appendix B). If the alcohol use screening is left undocumented it leaves potentially hundreds of patients at risk for untreated AWS, and preventable healthcare dollars wasted. The evidence shows that treatment preventing AWS at the earliest possible juncture, with a protocol for symptom triggered management such as the CIWA protocol, produces the best outcomes (Rubinsky et al., 2013; Melson, Kane, Mooney & McWilliams, 2014). These outcomes include a decrease in the development of AWS and Delirium Tremens (DTs), as well as decreases in use of restraints, a need for intensive care unit level of care, length of stay, risk of infections (sepsis, pneumonia, and surgical site), and complications from organ dysfunction (Melson, et al., 2014; Ungur, et al., 2013). By screening all patients for alcohol use at admission via the emergency department, (where a large portion of the inpatient admissions occur at Norton Hospital’s downtown campus), and ensuring adherence to the documentation of the current method in the admission navigator under alcohol use screening, we can capture a larger percentage of patients who will qualify for treatment, and monitor for complications of AWS. In turn reducing alcohol use related complications and improvement of outcomes such as length of stay, utilization of higher ASSESSMENT OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME 4 levels of care, use of restraints, and mortality. As improvement in these things can reduce health care cost and increase patient satisfaction. Purpose The purpose of this project was to measure adherence rates to the current alcohol use screening process and identify outcomes (length of hospital stay, number of ICU days, restraint use, level of care at admission, and mortality), of patients admitted to Norton Hospital. The adherence to the current alcohol screening process was reviewed via retrospective chart review. The specific aims of this project were: 1. Measure adherence rate to the current alcohol use screening process, on all adults (those greater than 18 years of age), admitted as inpatients from the emergency department (ED), for greater than 24 hours between April 2016 and April 2017. 2. Identify subject demographics (medical record number, age, ethnicity, and gender), length of stay, number of ICU days, restraint use days, mortality, level of care at admission (ICU, Telemetry Care [TCU], Monitored MedicalSurgical [LLM/tele] or Non-monitored medical surgical [MS]), incidence of AWS/DTs, and activation of the CIWA protocol in all adult patients admitted through the ED, for greater than 24 hours between April 2016 and April 2017. 3. Perform in-group comparisons of subject demographics (age, ethnicity, gender), length of stay, number of ICU days, restraint use days, mortality, level of care at admission (ICU, TCU, LLM/tele, or MS), incidence of AWS/DTs, and activation of the CIWA protocol, among adult patients who screened positive for alcohol use, patients who screened negative for alcohol ASSESSMENT OF ALCOHOL WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME 5 use, and those patients who were not screened for alcohol use upon admission from the ED for greater than 24 hours, between April 2016 and April ",

        "abstract": "The effect of feeding graded levels of detoxified Leucaena leucocephala meal (LLM) basal diet on carcass and meat quality attributes of broiler chickens was investigated. Seven isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets were formulated both for starter and finisher phases, designated TI, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 and T7. The control diet no Leucaena meal (T1) was maize-soybean based diet, while 5% soaked Leucaena meal (T2), 10% soaked Leucaena meal (T3), 5% boiled Leucaena meal (T4),10% bolied Leucaena meal (T5), 5% raw Leucaena meal (T6) and 10% raw Leucaena meal (T7) were incorporated into the diets and were supplemented with 0.3% methionine. 140 day old broiler chicks (Marshall Strain) purchased from Obasanjo Farm (Ota in Nigeria) were used for this study. Completely randomized design (CRD) with statistical model Yij=µ+Ti + random error was employed. At the end of 8 weeks of feeding trial, 56 birds (8 birds from each group) were randomly selected, slaughtered and processed. Carcass cut – up parts were weighed and their percentages calculated, meat quality was measured through physical variables and sensory evaluation using a taste panel and the scores were analysed with a 9-point hedonic scale where 1 = dislike extremely and 9 = like extremely. The results showed that T5 had higher life (1787± 0.59g), eviscerated (943.67±1.00g), thigh (71.98±1.00g) and back (189.92±1.00g) weights as well as carcass (63.43±0.10), thigh (7.55±0.10), back (19.92±0.58) and wing (6.65±0.08) dressing percentages. Meat cooking loss (46.54±1.00) and thermal shortening (63.59±1.00) were higher in meat from T6, but meat from T4 had higher cooking yield (68.08±1.00) and water holding capacity (51.33±1.00). Meat samples from T1 (5.23±1.00), T3 (5.25±1.00), T6 (5.29±0.52) and T7 (5.36±1.00) Shear force values while meat samples from T4 had higher colour (5.90±0.06), flavour (5.73±0.10) and overall acceptability(5.77±1.00) scores, however, T4 and T5 elicited higher tenderness (5.40±1.00), (5.20±1.00) juiciness (5.60±0.11), and texture (5.50±0.11), (5.43±0.11) scores.

        "abstract": "It has been widely acknowledged that further understanding about the cell adhesion (e.g., leukocyte rolling adhesion) can help us gain more knowledge about the causes of relevant diseases and design more effective treatments and diagnoses. Although recent simulation studies considered the deformability of the leukocytes, most of them, however, did not consider the bending deformation of microvilli. In this paper, an advanced leukocyte model based on an immersed boundary lattice-Boltzmann lattice-spring model (LLM) and an adhesive dynamics (AD) is presented in details. The flexural stiffness of microvilli is introduced into the model for simulations of leukocyte rolling adhesion. This innovative model is applied to investigate the influences of bending deformation of microvilli on the process of leukocyte rolling adhesion and the underlying mechanism at different shear rates. It is demonstrated that the bending deformation of microvilli can be influenced by the flexural stiffness of microvilli and shear rates, resulting in the different rolling velocity of leukocytes, number of receptor-ligand bonds, and bond forces. The findings clearly indicate that the bending of microvilli plays a crucial role in the dynamics of leukocyte adhesion.",

Furthermore, the results of simulated models suggest that as long as the diameter of the felled trees is less than 40 cm, the cut-to-length system is not an economical alternative. The cut-to-length method can be applied for trees with larger diameter (more than 40 cm), and in short skidding distance SLM is preferable to LLM but in cases of long skidding distance, LLM is more economical than SLM.Research highlights: DLand SD were the main causes which influenced the productivity and cost of ground-based logging methods.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper considers the factors that motivate qualified legal professionals to undertake a further legal academic programme of study. The paper analyses the findings of a recent study concerning a post-graduate research degree collaboration between Northumbria University (NU) and the Law Society of Ireland (LSI) whereby NU’s longstanding LLM Advanced Legal Practice (LLM ALP) has been offered in Ireland through the LSI (LLM ALP (Ire)). The initial offering of the LLM ALP (Ire) has attracted a significant amount of interest from the profession, prompting the authors to consider (i) the factors that motivate ‘time-poor’ professionals to pursue the academic study of law at the post-professional level and (ii) the potential that such a course of study might have to inform and enrich the students’ practice of law. The LLM ALP (Ire) has attracted a significant amount of more established practitioners, whereas those who generally enrol on the LLM ALP in England are at the early stages of their careers, either enrolled on the Legal Practice Course (LPC) or having only recently qualified. Hence this research is focused on a particular student profile of post-professionals with established careers in legal practice.",

        "abstract": "Emerging “direct-to-consumer” health products and devices are not addressed by current HIPAA legislation. Healthcare providers should feel comfortable to encourage the use of novel patient-centered technology as it would be highly favorable to improve public health. Unfortunately, gaps and overlaps in the U.S. data privacy laws and regulations have opened a new avenue for third-party entities to obtain sensitive private health information from non-covered health oriented technologies and use it inappropriately for employment decisions or even health, life and other insurance premium purposes. As cogently illustrated in a 2019 article in The New York Times: “The current protocols for exchanging patients’ data, for instance, would let people use consumer apps to get different types of information, like their prescription drug history. But it is an all-or-nothing choice. People who authorized an app to collect their medication lists would not be able to stop it from retrieving specific data-like the names of H.I.V. or cancer drugs-they might prefer to keep private.”  In fact, unauthorized access to sensitive health data by hackers could lead to fraudulent filings of tax returns, fraudulently filing of healthcare claims to insurance companies; or the receipt of other types of benefits such as acquiring free drug prescriptions.",

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has developed the Runway Safety Program (RSP) to address these concerns and improve the safety of the National Airspace System (NAS). The purpose of this study was to determine whether the FAA 2009–2011 RSP has effectively reduced runway incursions at the nation’s 5 busiest airports using data from 3 years before and 3 years after the RSP. A comparison group interrupted time-series design was used to determine the impact of the RSP. A public policy framework served as the theoretical foundation for this study. Data were collected from the FAA on runway incursions occurring from October 1, 2005 through September 30, 2014 and assessed for appropriate inclusion criteria. An analysis of the dataset using chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests established that though the RSP has made progress, it has not effectively reduced runway incursions at the nation’s 5 busiest airports. The RSP has decreased the number of runway incursion caused by air traffic controllers, reduced the overall severity of runway incursions, as well as positively influenced when, during the phase of flight, most runway incursions happen. An increase in pilot deviations suggests finding better ways to reduce these type of runway incursions is critical, especially with the forecasted growth in air travel. Continued deployment of runway safety technology is also important. With increased aviation safety, positive social change will occur through enhanced public safety while traveling, safer working environments at airports, as well as economic stimulus resulting from increased aviation activities benefiting individuals and developing countries throughout the world.During the last decade, the number of runway incursions at airports in the United States and worldwide has increased.

        "abstract": "This dissertation was written as part of the LLM in Transnational and European Commercial Law, Mediation, Arbitration and Energy Law at the International Hellenic University. The regulation of renewable energy sources and especially renewable electricity has been a highly disputed legal issue. Its particularity lies in their cross-cutting nature of renewable energy sources, in the sense that they affect a variety of policy areas, such as competition, state aid, environmental policy and climate change. The effort of national governments to create incentives for the promotion of renewable electricity production has been materialized through the development of national support schemes. These schemes come, nevertheless, with a number of implications. Not only should these support schemes be in compliance with the current market obligations, but also with the EU state aid and free movement of goods provisions. The role of the European Commission, as well as that of the case law of the European Court of Justice (CJEU) has been vital in providing guiding lines in these complex matters. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to address three fundamental issues in relation to the regulation of renewable electricity at EU level. The first part of the paper presents the legal background of both conventional and renewable electricity markets in the EU and discusses the ‘bindingness’ of the targets imposed by Directive 2009/28/EC. The second part of the paper explores in detail the existing national support schemes for the promotion of RES-E and examines their market compatibility. In the last part, the interaction of national support schemes with State aid and free movement of goods provisions is analyzed, in both cases the starting point being PreussenElektra.",

Pemilihan judul ini di latarbelakangi oleh adanya kekaburan hukum terkait pengaturan mengenai merek yang mempunyai persamaan pada pokoknya, selain itu juga belum ada mekanisme yang pasti dalam menilai persamaan pada pokoknya serta penilaian yang bersifat subjektif. Karena pengaturan yang masih memiliki kekaburan hukum serta belum ada mekanisme yang pasti inilah yang menyebabkan hakim dalam memutus perkara merek memiliki pertimbangan yang berbeda-beda. Hal tersebut kenyataannya mengakibatkan adanya perbedaan putusan mengenai pembatalan merek baik itu di tingkat pertama maupun kasasi pada kasus yang sama. Jenis penelitian yang dipakai yaitu penelitian yuridis normatif dengan menggunakan jenis pendekatan perundang-undangan dan pendekatan kasus, dibantu dengan bahan hukum primer, sekunder, dan tersier. Teknik analisa bahan hukum dilakukan dengan cara interpretasi gramatikal dan interpretasi sistematis menurut penulis, perlu adanya pembentukan peraturan yang mengatur terkait mekanisme penilaian persamaan pada pokoknya, serta dalam memutus perkara persamaan pada pokoknya sebaiknya dikaitkan dengan adanya itikad tidak baik, sehingga hakim dalam memberikan putusannya tidak memiliki perbedaan baik itu pada tingkat pertama maupun pada tingkat kasasi.

In addition, there is no specific mechanism in assessing the essential similarity, and the assessment done is too subjective. This ambiguity of law and poor mechanism spark different considerations, meaning that there are also varied decisions from the considerations over the cancellation of trademark either in a court of the first instance or cassation. This research employed a normative juridical method supported with primary, secondary, and tertiary legal materials. The analysis technique of the legal materials involved grammatical and systematic interpretation. It is essential that the formation of regulation which regulates the mechanism of assessment of essential similarity.

        "abstract": "\n \n \n Achalasia is at present classified in 3 manometric patterns. Pattern III is the most unfrequent pattern and is correlated with the worst outcome after all available treatments. We aimed to investigate the final outcome after classic laparoscopic myotomy (length ≤ 8cm, CLM) as compared with a longer laparoscopic myotomy both downwards and upwards with (length > 8cm, LLM) in patients with pattern III achalasia.\n \n \n \n The study population consisted of 50 consecutive patients with pattern III achalasia who underwent laparoscopic myotomy between 1997–2017. Patients who had already been treated with surgical or endoscopic procedures were ruled out. Patients before 2010 had a traditional CLM procedure while patients after 2010 had a LLM. Symptoms were collected and scored using a detailed questionnaire; barium-swallow, endoscopy, manometry (conventional or HRM) were performed, before and after surgical treatment.\n \n \n \n Of the 50 patients representing the study population, 23 had CLM and 27 had LLM. In addition, all the patients add an anterior, partial fundoplication (Dor). The patients’ demographic and clinical parameters (sex, symptom-score, duration of symptoms, esophageal-diameter) were similar in both groups. No intraoperative mucosal lesions were detected. The median length of the myotomy was 7 cm (IQR:7–8) in the CLM and 10 cm (IQR:10–11) in the LLM (P < 0.001). The median of follow-up was 61 months (IQR:35–93) in the CLM and 24 months (IQR:16–36) in the LLM. As a whole, the two groups had a different drop in their symptom score: 21 (17–26) versus 6 (0–8), and 21 (18–27) versus 3 (0–6) for the CLM and LLM respectively (P < 0.05). Moreover, failures were 7/23 (30%) in the CLM and 3/27 (11.1%) in the LLM (P < 0.001). An abnormal acid exposure was detected after the treatment in 4 patients of CLM and in 3 of LLM (P = n.s.).\n \n \n \n In spite of intrinsic limitations of the study (retrospective, different time window of the two procedures and different follow-up), the extension of the length of the myotomy both downwards and upwards improves the final outcome of the laparoscopic Heller-Dor procedure in patients with pattern III achalasia. On the other hand, a longer myotomy does not influence the development of postoperative gastroesophageal reflux.\n \n \n \n All authors have declared no conflicts of interest.\n",

Transparent, bulk single crystals with varied morphology of LLM were harvested in 20 days. The lattice parameters were calculated by single crystal X – ray diffraction. The effect of Mg2+ doping on the growth, optical and microhardness properties has been investigated. The presence of functional groups has been assigned by FTIR spectral analysis. UV – Vis – NIR spectrum was recorded to study the optical transmittance and absorbance of grown crystal. The dielectric behavior of the crystals was also studied. Photoluminescence study of pure and doped LLM reveals that it exhibits emission in blue region. Etching study was carried out using optical microscopy to study the dislocation, surface defects and morphology. Kurtz and Perry powder second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency of the doped crystal is found to be 0.32 times that of KDP.",

ABSTRACT The issue discussed in this research is related to the relevance of Article 3 Paragraph (1) of Government Regulation Number 54 Year 2007 regarding an adopted child of the same religion as the foster parents’ as part of the regulation of child adoption provided in Article 2 of Government Regulation Number 54 of 2007. This research employed statute and conceptual approach, and the result revealed that this issue could be seen as either relevant or not relevant to some extent when aspects of child protection are taken into account. Regarding the children education, it is essential that the concept of the same religion be adjusted to the education the child receives. Child protection in terms of health, social rights, special protection, protection of their clothing, housing, and law will not be relevant when there is still a concept of the same religion. Adopting children of the same religion must be reasonable and the solution to the absence of adoption, if any, should also be considered. Different religion of either the parents or the adopted child should be allowed recalling that the main purpose of the adoption is to support the welfare ofand protection for the adopted child. Therefore, there should be no issue that could create a barrier regarding the adoption. Keywords : relevance, religion, adoption, welfare, child protection.",

Vehicle detection system is used to perform traffic measurement such as tracking, detecting and monitoring vehicles. In Malaysia, Malaysian Highway Authority (MHA) or Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysa (LLM) is a body responsible for conducting the traffic measurement to measure the congestion level of the highway. The congestion data collected can be further used by other official bodies such as traffic police in controlling traffic and Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR) in route planning and management. However, the vehicle detection systems in Malaysia are not fully automated and many are relying on human to manually monitor the congestion. Motivated by the need of automated vehicle detection system, this project implements a vehicle detection system that consists of a video camera for capturing the vehicles on the road and a sliding window technique developed in Visual C++ to record, detect and count the vehicles. The performance is measured in term of accuracy by measuring the percentage of the detections.",

ABSTRACT This research discusses about conflict of norms related to the concept of incest marriage between the Chinese customary law and Marriage law. According to the Chinese customary law, a person is allowed to marry someone that it is included on marriage prohibitions according to Article 8, Letter a to e of the Marriage Law, as long as they do not have the same surname (similar in “she”). Based on this discourses, the formulation of the problem is related to the legality of incest marriage by Indonesian Citizens of Chinese Descent related to the marriage prohibitions in Article 8, Letter a to e of the Law Number 1 Year 1974 on Marriage. The result of the research indicates that the marriage according to the Chinese customary law conducted by Indonesian citizens of Chinese descent is legal and irrevocable. It is because there are exceptions in the marriage prohibitions, according to Article 8, Letter f of the Law Number 1 Year 1974 on Marriage, namely the prohibition of marriage in Article 8, Letters a to e can be disregarded if conducted according to the religion and the other applicable laws.

        "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique is playing increasingly important roles in the field of industrial engineering. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation technique has been widely used in commercial software because of low requirement for computing grids, but its application to unsteady and separated flows remains questionable and unsatisfactory due to the lack of generality of turbulence models. Largeeddy simulation (LES) can predict three-dimensional (3D) and unsteady flow fields, however, it still requires fairly fine grids when used to solve the wall-bounded turbulent flows of engineering interest. Such a situation has considerably stimulated the development of hybrid RANS/LES methods, among which is the commonly employed detached-eddy simulations (DES) technique [1]. Yet with the inherent advantages, hybrid RANS/LES methods have problematic drawbacks. For example, DES encounters the well-known log-layer mismatch (LLM) defect in predicting a simple turbulent channel flow [2]. In order for the LES to be feasible to numerically predict wall-bounded turbulent flows, Chen et al. [3] proposed a Reynolds-constrained large-eddy simulation (RCLES) method, which opened up a new way of modelling subgrid-scale (SGS) effects for LES of wall-bounded turbulent flows.",

ABSTRACT Conflict often occurs between employers and their employees/ labors, for it is often found that employers fail to meet the rights of their employees/ labors against the provision of Law on Labour Affairs. One of the common disputes that often arises is strike action due to the different interpretation of something between employers and their employees. This sort of dispute can be seen as valid and not valid. This is essential to know because the implementation of Article 144 of Law on Labour Affairs is supported by Article 187 of Law on Labour Affairs in a District Court. This raises the ambiguity in the law regarding an organization authorized to make a decision on the validity of strike action. Principally, it is essential to analyze and study this issue by employing statute approach. The research result reveals that Article 144 of Law on Labour Affairs prohibits employers to (a) replace employees with those from outside the company, (b) impose the criminal sanction or retaliation on employees. When the strike has done is considered valid, the companies will not be given any criminal sanction. On the contrary, when it is found invalid, the sanction will be imposed on employers based on Article 187 of Law of Labour Affairs. The dispute arising in industrial relations must be determined by the court of Industrial Relations according to absolute authority owned by the court of Industrial Relations in terms of making a decision of strike action.

Terdapat kekaburan hukum dalam ketentuan Pasal 12 ayat (1) PP Pengangkatan Anak tersebut. Kekaburan hukum tersebut terletak pada huruf b yaitu mengenai pengertian “anak telantar atau ditelantarkan”, sedangkan dalam penjelasan Pasal 12 ayat (1) huruf b PP Pengangkatan Anak yang hanya bertuliskan cukup jelas.

ABSTRACT The Requirement of child adoption is regulated in Article 12 Paragraph (1) of Government Regulation, in which the adopted child must be 18 years old and he or she is abandoned, under the custody of a family or in the orphan house and needs special protection. However, there is still a vague of norm in the provision of Article 12 Paragraph (1) of Government Regulation on Child Adoption. The ambiguity can be found in letter b concerning the definition of ‘abandoned child’ or ‘a child that is abandoned’, while the information contained in Article 12 Paragraph (1) letter b of government Regulation on child adoption procedures is only stated as clear enough. In the provision of Article 12 Paragraph (1) letter b of Government Regulation, there is a conjunction ‘or’, meaning the two provisions hold similar meaning but the definition of similarity or difference of the two provisions regarding the child adoption is left unexplained in letter b. The research problems involve the scope of definition of the provision in Article 12 Paragraph 1 letter b of Government Regulation of the Republic of Indonesia Number 54 of 2007 on Child Adoption. The research result concludes that the phrase “abandoned child” in Article 12 Paragraph (1) of Government Regulation, abandoned child can be defined as a non-adult person that is left abandoned and not taken care of, physically, mentally, and spiritually abandoned, all of which may be affected by poor family condition. Those situations highlight that the child needs assistance. Keywords : child adoption, abandoned child, a child who is abandoned",

This dissertation begins with the presentation of the general concept of European Union citizenship along with some historical data.Emphasis is given to the legal basis of the european citizenship and its connection with national citizenship,along with some important case law.The freedom of movement within the territory of the European Member States and the Directive 2004/38/EC is another part of this thesis. Additionally,this dissertation presents some of the main social benefits that European Union citizens can claim during their residence or their travelling along other Member States,the prerequisites to claim these benefits and some important case law which has to do with the phenomenon of''benefit tourism''or''welfare tourism'' and how the European Court of Justice(ECJ)dealt with it,because it has been a''hot topic'' timely. In addition,there is a quick but inclusive reference to the Brexit,meaning the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union,David Cameron's demands,how it will affect people and Europe in general and all the current updates of what is occuring in Europe because of Brexit. Finally,I want to thank my supervisor,Professor Mr.Thomas Papadopoulos for his kind assistance and guidance with my dissertation.His lectures inspired me to choose this subject for my dissertation and his instructions were very helpful and organized,always willing to help me and guide me.

        "abstract": "In this paper we examine the geographic patterns of employment growth and employment polarization in small and medium-sized cities (SMCs ) in Denmark. The geography of employment polarization in Danish cities is examine d using register-based employment data on occupations and wages divided into the public and p rivate sectors in the period 1993-2006; the long period of transformation and growth in the Dan ish economy. We conclude that employment growth is characterized by employment polarization c mbined with growth in lowand highwage employment and a decline in medium-wage employ ment. However, these patterns of polarization differ across the public and private s ectors, as well as by geography. While local labour market (LLM) size, city position and city sp ecialization influence the geography of private-sector employment growth and polarization, municipal population and composition influence the geography of public-sector growth pat terns across wage levels. Finally, public and private employment are positively associated within SMCs, predominantly driven by the positive association between public employment and private-s ector low-wage employment. However, public employment is not associated with an increas e in private low-wage employment in more remote areas.",

Analisis ini dilakukan berdasarkan konferensi internasional yang berhubungan dengan peran ASEAN dan Hak asasi manusia internasional. Analisis ini dilatarbelakangi adanya  kejahatan kemanusiaan yang dilakukan oleh Myanmar selaku anggota ASEAN terhadap etnis Rohingya. Analisis ini menggunakan metode penelitian pendekatan kasus dan pendekatan perundang-undangan. Berdasarkan hal tersebut, kesimpulan yang dapat diambil dalam analisis ini adalah bahwa Peran Asean dalam menyelesaikan penyelesaian sengketa/ kejahatan kemanusiaan di Myanmar sebatas Mediasi. Seperti sudah di jelaskan bahwa Myanmar adalah anggota ASEAN, maka ASEAN dapat membantu Myanmar dengan etnis Rohingya agar berdamai.

ABSTRACT This article discusses the role of ASEAN regarding the criminal case committed by Myanmar to Rohingya ethnic group. The analysis was performed based on an international conference regarding the role of ASEAN and International Human Rights. The observation was triggered by the criminality of attacking a human being done to Rohingya by Myanmar as a member of ASEAN. The statute and case approaches were employed in this research. It is concluded that the role of ASEAN in settling the criminal dispute between Myanmar and Rohingya ethnic group is only restricted to mediation. As commonly known that Myanmar is the member of ASEAN, ASEAN could only encourage reconciliation between Myanmar and Rohingya, while the legal effort that could be performed by ASEAN may involve negotiation, good services provision, and mediation. Moreover, the dispute could also be overcome in relevance to Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations. Keywords: the role of ASEAN, criminality, Myanmar and Rohingya Ethnic Group",

ABSTRACT Social Security (JS) under which Insurance for work accident (JKK) is provided is the form of legal protection provided for workers. In JKK regulated in Article 48 Paragraph 3 on Illnesses resulting from work, it is stated that an ex-worker diagnosed with an illness due to the work he/she does in which the illness is proven with doctor’s note deserves the benefit of JKK. The types of illness as referred to in Article 48 Paragraph 3 are enacted based on Presidential Decree as explained in Presidential Decree Number 44 of 2015 on implementation of JKK and JKM. This leads to the absence of law over the types of illness caused by work. The research problems involve: What form of legal protection is to be provided for ex-workers diagnosed with illness due to the work they do. This research is categorised into a legal research which employed statute and conceptual approaches. The data obtained was analysed grammatically and systematically. The research result reveals that an ex-worker diagnosed with an illness due to the job he/she was previously involved in has a right to be provided with legal protection in the form of JKK, in which medical checkup can be performed regularly. Report on accident at work is under the responsibility of an employer. There should be a presidential decree that regulates the types of illnesses resulting from the work, as this case is only regulated in Presidential Decree not in other forms of regulation for a better consistency of the regulation made.

Yaklaşık 30 yıldır allojenik HKHN yapılan olgularda nakil sonrası kemik iliği mikroçevresi ve stromasının, alıcı kimliğini koruduğu bilinmektedir (1). Bu durumda farklı cinsiyetler arasında yapılan nakillerde, dişi/erkek niş ve stromada, karşı cinsten gelen hematopoetik kök hücrelerin biyolojik davranışı merak uyandırmıştır. Yapılan çalışmalarda, allojenik HKHN tedavisinin sonuçlarını etkileyen en önemli faktörlerden birinin alıcı ve verici arasındaki cinsiyet uyumu olduğu gösterilmiştir (2). Cinsiyet uyumu olmaksızın yapılan allojenik HKHN’de, multipar kadın verici ve erkek alıcı kombinasyonunun, gerek akut gerekse kronik graft versus host hastalığı (GVHH)’nın artmış sıklığı ile birlikte olduğu gösterilmiştir (3-6). Bunun bir yansıması olarak transplant ilişkili mortalitenin de arttığı ve hatta bazı çalışmalarda daha düşük hastalık relaps oranı birlikteliğinin izlendiği gösterilmiştir (7-11). Sağlıklı erkek ve kadınlarda ortalama hemoglobin seviyeleri farklılık göstermektedir (12). Erkeklerde ortalama hemoglobin seviyesi, kadınlara göre yaklaşık %12’lik bir oran ile yüksektir. Bu farklılık genel anlamda, erkeklerdeki androjenin eritropoetin ile ilişkili direkt kemik iliğinin stimülasyonu, yine böbrekten eritropoetin üretiminin androjene bağlı artışı ve kadınlarda östrojenin kemik iliği üzerine olan inhibitör etkilerine bağlanmıştır (13,14). Bununla birlikte cinsiyet uyumsuz allojenik HKHN gibi bir tedavide ve özellikle alıcı kimliğinin korunduğu bilinen bir mikroçevrede, cinsiyetler arası doğuştan mevcut hemoglobin değerleri arasındaki farklılığın, nakil sonrası döneme olan etkileri hakkındaki araştırmalar sınırlı kalmıştır. Bu çalışmada amacımız, cinsiyet uyumsuz allojenik HKHN sonrası hastalarda hemoglobin ve kırmızı küre dağılım aralığı (RDW) değerlerinin nasıl etkilendiğinin değerlendirilmesidir. HASTAlAR ve YÖNTEM Bu retrospektif çalışmaya 2011-2015 yılları arasında Şişli Florence Nightingale Hastanesi Hematopoetik Kök Hücre Nakli Merkezinde birinci tam remisyonda iken, allojenik HKHN yapılan ve nakil sonrası en az 1 yıldır remisyonda takip edilmekte olan toplam 70 de novo akut lösemi olgusu dahil edildi. Yaş aralığı 18-55 yıl olarak belirlendi. Çalışmaya alınan tüm hastalarda, miyeloablatif hazırlık rejimleri ve kök hücre kaynağı olarak da periferik kök hücre kullanıldı. Hastalar alıcı-verici cinsiyet uyumuna göre dört ayrı gruba ayrıldı. Cinsiyet uyumlu toplam 32 (%46) hastada, kadından kadına (KK) 15 hasta ve erkekten erkeğe (EE) 17 hasta çalışmaya uygun saptanırken, cinsiyet uyumsuz toplam 38 (%54) olgudan, 19 kadından erkeğe (KE) ve yine 19 erkekten kadına (EK) allojenik HKHN olgusu çalışma için uygunluk ölçütlerini sağlamıştır. Hastaların tüm demografik özelliklerinin yanı sıra nakil öncesi hazırlık dönemi sırasında ve nakil sonrası 12. ayda bakılan tetkiklerinde gruplar arasındaki hemoglobin ve RDW farklılıkları değerlendirilmiştir. Çalışmanın istatistiksel analizleri IBM SPSS versiyon 20.0 kullanılarak yapılmıştır. Normal dağılımın analizinde Shapiro-Wilk testi ve değişkenlerin karşılaştırmalarında T-testi kullanılmıştır.

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email: cindynatasha01@gmail.com ABSTRAK Penelitian ini membahas mengenai adanya pertentangan antara Putusan MA dengan Putusan MK Nomor 37/PUU-IX/2011 terkait upah proses PHK, dimana terdapat perbedaan putusan pada Putusan MA mengenai upah proses PHK pasca dikeluarkannya Putusan MK Nomor 37/PUU-IX/2011. Putusan MK Nomor 37/PUU-IX/2011 menyatakan bahwa upah proses PHK wajib diberikan oleh Pengusaha kepada Pekerja sampai dengan suatu putusan perselisihan PHK mempunyai kekuatan hukum mengikat (inkracht) , namun pada Putusan MA, Majelis Hakim MA memutus perkara mengenai upah proses PHK dengan memberikan upah proses hanya sebanyak 6 (enam) bulan upah saja. Oleh karena itu Putusan MA dengan Putusan MK Nomor 37/PUU-IX/2011 saling bertentangan, sehingga menimbulkan permasalahan hukum terkait pemberian upah proses PHK. Berdasarkan hal tersebut, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis akibat hukum putusan hakim mengenai upah proses PHK yang tidak sama dengan Putusan MK Nomor 37/PUU-IX/2011. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian hukum dengan menggunakan pendekatan Perundang-undangan dan pendekatan kasus. Teknik analisis bahan hukum menggunakan interpretasi gramatikal dan interpretasi sistematis. Dari hasil penelitian yang telah dilakukan, penulis berpendapat bahwa Putusan MA yang berbeda atau tidak sesuai dengan Putusan MK adalah tidak bertentangan karena dalam hal perkara upah proses PHK masih dimungkinkan adanya pengaturan lebih lanjut, sedangkan dalam hal ini pengaturan lebih lanjut mengenai upah proses PHK belum ada, maka Putusan MA yang tidak sama dengan Putusan MK dengan sendirinya memiliki kekuatan hukum mengikat karena Putusan MA tersebut telah sesuai dengan jangka waktu penyelesaian perselisihan PHK menurut UU PPHI. Sedangkan akibat hukum yang timbul dari Putusan MA yang tidak sesuai dengan Putusan MK adalah tetap berlaku dan mengikat para pihak karena Putusan MA dan MK adalah tidak bertentangan, sehingga dengan demikian melahirkan hak dan kewajiban bagi para pihak untuk melaksanakan putusan tersebut.

The Decision by Constitutional Court states that the wage of process in PHK needs to be paid when the decision regarding the dispute of PHK holds a binding legal power ( inkracht ), but in the Decision by Supreme Court, the judge of Supreme Court has decided that the wage paid only covers six-month wage. This issue shows that both decisions are in dispute and causes further problem related to wage of process in PHK. This research, therefore, is aimed to analyse the legal consequence of decision by Supreme Court regarding the wage of process in PHK not relevant to the decision made by Constitutional Court. This research employed statute and case approaches, and the legal materials obtained were grammatically and systematically interpreted. From the research result, it is revealed that the irrelevance between the decision of Supreme Court and that of Constitutional Court should not be an issue, since the Decision made by the Supreme Court is in line with the period of dispute of PHK as regulated in Law on Dispute Settlement in Industrial Relationship. However, the legal consequence caused by the Decision by Supreme Court irrelevant to the Decision by Constitutional Court is effective and binding for all parties.

Email : fazalakmalmusyarri.bu@gmail.com ABSTRAK Merek merupakan salah satu bentuk Hak Kekayaan Intelektual yang diperlukan guna kepentingan suatu usaha. Merek memiliki peranan yang besar dalam menunjang perkembangan suatu usaha. Selain sebagai media untuk promosi, merek juga memperlihatkan eksistensi dan reputasi suatu usaha. Terkhusus bagi Merek yang telah memiliki reputasi yang bagus akan masuk dalam kategori Merek Terkenal. Parameter Merek Terkenal di Indonesia dilihat dari seberapa masif promosi dan investasi yang dilakukan oleh pengusaha pemilik Merek serta negara-negara tempat suatu Merek telah didaftarkan dan jika perlu dapat dilakukan survey untuk mengetahui secara empiris reputasi suatu Merek. Namun perlindungan terhadap Merek Terkenal di Indonesia masih belum menunjukkan komitmen yang kuat. Hal ini diperlihatkan dari banyaknya kasus pelanggaran Merek yang bahkan telah mencapai tingkat terakhir di pengadilan dan putusannya telah berkekuatan hukum tetap. Namun fakta sosiologis tersebut belum diakomodasi secara penuh oleh Undang-Undang Nomor 20 Tahun 2016 tentang Merek dan Indikasi Geografis. Meskipun undang-undang tersebut merupakan norma baru yang mengatur mengenai Merek dan mencabut keberlakuan undang-undang sebelumnya yaitu Undang-Undang Nomor 15 Tahun 2001 tentang Merek, namun pengaturan perlindungan pelanggaran Merek belum dilakukan secara maksimal. Perubahan dari undang-undang lama ke undang-undang baru tidak memperlihatkan perkembangan yang signifikan sehingga masih belum memberikan perlindungan yang optimal bagi pemilik Merek khususnya Merek Terkenal dari pelanggaran Merek. Pelanggaran Merek yang menjadi objek kajian penulis adalah Passing Off . Maka dalam penelitian ini, penulis berusaha menggali akomodasi pengaturan Passing Off terhadap Merek Terkenal dalam Undang-Undang Merek baru dan membandingkan dengan Undang-Undang Merek lama melalui penafsiran hakim dalam putusan. Selain itu juga membandingkan dengan negara yang telah melakukan perlindungan terhadap Hak Kekayaan Intelektual yang baik dan telah diakui oleh dunia.

The Trademarks has a huge role in supporting the development of a business. In addition to a medium for a promotion, the Trademarks also showed the existence of and the reputation of a business. Especially for a Trademarks that has had a good reputation will fall into the category of famous Trademarks. The parameters of the famous Trademarks in Indonesia seen from how massive promotion and investments made by Trademarks owners as well as the countries where a Trademark has been registered, and if necessary may be conducted a survey to find out empirically the reputation of a Trademarks. However, the protection of famous Trademarks in Indonesia still has not shown a strong commitment. This is shown by the number of cases of violation of the Trademarks that has even reached the last level in the courts and an award has been measured. However the fact the sociological accommodated in full in Law Number 20 of 2016 on Trademarks and Geographical Indications. Although the legislation is the new norm governing the Trademarks and revokes the enforceability of previous legislation, namely Law Number 15 of 2001 on Trademarks, but the Trademarks infringement protection arrangements have not been made to the maximum. The change from the old law to the new laws do not exhibit significant development so that still does not provide optimum protection for Trademarks owners, in particular, the famous Trademarks of offense. Violation of the Trademarks that became the object of study is the author of Passing Off. So in this study, the authors attempted to dig out the accommodation arrangements are Passing Off against well-known Trademarks in the Trademarks new law and compare with the old Trademarks law through interpretation of the judges of the award.

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email : sswantochanub422@gmail.com ABSTRAK Indonesia merupakan salah satu negara yang banyak menggirimkan tenaga kerjanya ke luar negeri, salah satunya adalah Negara Arab Saudi. hal ini dipicu karena Arab Saudi merupakan negara dengan penghasil minyak tertinggi di dunia, dan beberapa kemudahan yang didapatkan oleh TKI yang bekerja di Arab diantaranya adalah untuk melaksanakan ibadah haji, hal inilah yang membuat Tenaga Kerja Indonesia untuk bermigrasi ke Arab Saudi. Namun, dalam pelaksanaanya TKI yang berada di Arab tidak selalu berjalan dengan baik, ada kalanya para TKI mengalami beberapa permasalahan  yang menyudutkan mereka. Diantara permasalahan tersebut adalah adanya penganiyaaan yang dilakukan oleh majikan, Pemutusan Hubungan Kerja Sepihak, serta gaji yang tidak dibayarkan. Oleh karena faktor itulah Menteri Ketenagakerjaan Indonesia memberlakukan kebijakan moratorium TKI ke Arab Saudi pada Tahun 2015. Jenis penelitian dalam penulisan karya ilmiah ini merupakan jenis penelitian yuridis normatif dengan upaya untuk menganalisis ketentuan mengenai berlakunya kebijakan moratorium TKI Penata Laksana Rumah Tangga dengan beberapa peraturan terkait lainnya serta dengan menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan serta pendekatan perbandingan. Dalam upaya pemberlakuan kebijakan moratorium tersebut dinilai telah bertentangan dengan peraturan-peraturan lainnya yang mengatur dengan pelarangan serta penghentian TKI di luar negeri. serta dengan adanya pelarangan serta penghentian TKI ke luar negeri dinilai telah membatasi ruang gerak Warga Negara Indonesia untuk mendapatkan suatu kesempatan pekerjaan di luar Negeri. karena kesempatan pekerjaan tidak hanya terbatas pada negara sendiri yaitu Indonesia. Melainkan juga untuk mendapatkan kesempatan pekerjaan di negara-negara lainnya seperti Negara Arab Saudi. Kata Kunci: Moratorium, Tenaga Kerja Indonesia, Penata Laksana Rumah Tangga ABSTRACT Indonesia is one of several countries which sends a number of its workforce overseas such as to Saudi Arabia. It is simply because Saudi Arabia offers access to Moslem pilgrims to Mecca. This feature attracts the higher number of workers to work there. However, in reality, not all overseas workers manage to pursue their dream to Mecca; several of them became the victim of domestic violence which involved the torture by their masters. Even worse, some did not receive their salary. Seeing this issue, the minister of a workforce in Indonesia applied the policy of moratorium of a workforce to Saudi Arabia in 2015. This is a normative juridical research with the statute and comparative approach. The application of moratorium is seen against other regulations dealing with the termination of sending workforce overseas. This termination surely affects opportunities to get a job.

ABSTRACT This thesis is aimed to study legal protection provided for Indonesian workers after transfer of authority of insurance consortium into social security agency. This research employed normative juridical method with statute approach. With the effectuation of social security agency (BPJS) as an organisation responsible for the execution of social security program for Indonesian workers working overseas (TKI), BPJS also covers other types of services such as Insurance for Work Accident (JKK) and Death Security (JKM) which are compulsory and Old-age Benefits which is elective. There is the difference in terms of the risk program provided by the insurance consortium and BPJS, leading to ambiguity when the risks not covered in JKK and JKM hit the workers. It is concluded that the legal protection that can be provided for TKI regarding social security should involve the certainty in the coordination of benefits. Keywords: legal protection, social security, Indonesian workers (TKI).",

Ada beberapa masalah penelitian yang disajikan: 1. Apa konsekuensi hukum bagi Indonesia dalam pasca-ratifikasi konvensi minamata tentang merkuri? 2. Apa jenis perlindungan hukum yang akan diberikan oleh Indonesia mengenai dampak merkuri yang dilepas dari kegiatan penambangan emas skala kecil?Penulis menggunakan metode yuridis normatif bersama dengan pendekatan undang-undang, sedangkan bahan hukum yang digunakan terdiri dari data primer, sekunder, dan tersier, diikuti oleh teknik analisis kualitatif deskriptif di mana fakta-fakta yang jelas digambarkan sebelum mereka disajikan sebagai objek pengamatan.Berdasarkan hasil penelitian, karena Indonesia telah meratifikasi konvensi Minamata, harus ada amandemen UU terkait merkuri, khususnya undang-undang tentang Pertambangan Mineral dan Batubara yang mengatur penambangan tradisional. Diharapkan bahwa substansi konvensi Minamata, yang terutama terkait dengan kegiatan penambangan emas skala kecil dan besar, dapat diterapkan di Indonesia. Tentunya langkah ini perlu diikuti dengan mendaftarkan total penambangan emas tradisional / penambangan skala kecil dan bahwa bentuk lain dari substansi diusulkan sebagai pengganti merkuri. Kata kunci: Konvensi Minamata, Ratifikasi, Pertambangan Rakyat, Merkuri. Abstract This title was picked related to the step taken in the ratification of the convention on mercury by the Indonesian government in which high content of mercury is produced from small-scale gold mining activities. There are several research problems presented: 1. What is the legal consequence for Indonesia in the post-ratification of Minamata convention on mercury? 2. What type of legal protection to be provided by Indonesia regarding the impact of mercury released from the small-scale gold mining activities? The author employed normative juridical method along with statute approach, while the legal materials used comprised the primary, secondary, and tertiary data, followed by the descriptive qualitative analysis technique where apparent facts were described before they served as the object of observation.Based on the research result, since Indonesia has ratified Minamata convention, there should be an amendment of Law related to mercury, especially the law on Mineral and Coal Mining that regulates traditional mining. It is expected that the substance of Minamata convention, which is mainly related to both small- and large-scale gold mining activities, could be applied in Indonesia. It is surely necessary that this step is followed by listing the total of traditional mining/ small-scale gold mining and that another form of the substance is proposed in substitution of mercury.

Siregar, Dr. Budi Santoso, S.H., LLM., Shanti Rizkawati, S.H., M.Kn Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya ziporasiregar13@gmail.com ABSTRAK Penelitian ini membahas permasalahan Analisis Perlindungan Hukum Kreditor Sebagai Pihak Ketiga Yang Dirugikan Berdasarkan Putusan Pidana Terkait Harta Pailit Yang Menjadi Barang Rampasan Negara (Studi Kasus Koperasi Simpan Pinjam Pandawa Mandiri Group). Penulisan ini dilatarbelakangi kasus KSP Pandawa Mandiri Group dimana perlindungan hukum bagi pihak ketiga sebagai kreditor saat putusan pernyataan pailit yang terlebih dahulu ada berhadapan dengan suatu putusan pidana terkait harta pailit yang menjadi barang rampasan negara. Penulis memperoleh jawaban atas permasalahan yang terjadi bahwa status harta pailit dalam perkara KSP Pandawa Mandiri Group adalah milik kreditor berdasarkan asas jaminan yang tertulis pada Pasal 1131 dan 1132 KUHPerdata sehingga walaupun hak milik harta tersebut adalah debitor namun setelah adanya Putusan Pernyataan Pailit harta tersebut berganti status menjadi milik para kreditornya. Sehingga dalam hal ini perlu adanya perlindungan hukum kepada para kreditor sebagai pihak ketiga yang dirugikan dengan adanya Putusan perkara Pidana untuk menjamin kreditor mendapatkan haknya. Dalam hukum perdata dikenal adanya derden verzet sebagai upaya perlawanan pihak ketiga yang dirugikan dalam suatu Putusan Pengadilan. Namun dalam proses peradilan hukum pidana di Indonesia secara yuridis belum diatur secara khusus seperti pada hukum perdata. Sehingga terdapat kekosongan peraturan yang dapat menimbulkan ketidakpastian hukum terhadap para kreditor KSP Pandawa Mandiri Group. Berdasarkan hal itu derden verzet yang dikenal dalam hukum perdata dapat diterapkan juga dalam peradilan perkara pidana sebagai suatu bentuk perlindungan hukum bagi kreditor dalam kasus yang terjadi pada KSP Pandawa Mandiri Group. Kata Kunci: Perlindungan Hukum, Kreditor , Harta Pailit ABSTRACT This research studies the issue over the analysis of legal protection for a disadvantaged creditor as the third party according to Criminal Decision regarding bankrupt asset evicted by the state. This research was initiated based on the case of saving and loan cooperative (hereinafter KSP) Pandawa Mandiri Group in which the legal protection pre-existing and provided for the third party is in conflict with the criminal decision over bankrupt asset convicted by the state. It can be concluded based on the research result that the bankrupt asset is under the ownership of the creditor according to the warranty written in Article 1131 and 1132 of Civil Code Procedure. In other words, although the asset was formerly owned by a debtor, the ownership status can alter to the ownership of the creditor after the issuance of the statement letter on bankrupt asset. Therefore, it is essential to provide legal protection for the third party disadvantaged by the criminal Decision to guarantee the creditor to gain his/her right. Measure taken to defend the advantaged third party due to the Court Decision issued is known as derde verzet in a civil law, but in the criminal judicial process in Indonesia, this case is not juridically regulated as in civil law. This situation leads to the absence of regulation that could trigger uncertainty of law towards creditors of KSP of Pandawa Mandiri Group. In this case, derden verzet common in civil law can also be applied in criminal court as a form of legal protection for creditors as what occurred in KSP Pandawa Mandiri Group.

Jasa Marga dalam memberikan perlindungan hukum terhadap pengguna E-toll card . Hal ini dilatar belakangi oleh munculnya berbagai kendala dalam penggunaan E-toll card yang dialami oleh konsumen khususnya di Tol pandaan serta tidak ada aturan spesifik dalam Peraturan Menteri Pekerjaan Umum dan Peraturan Rakyat Nomor 16/PRT/M/2017 tentang Transaksi Tol Non Tunai di Jalan Tol menegenai tanggung jawab badan usaha jalan tol apabila terjadi kesalahan dalam pengoperasian E-toll serta perlindungan yang didapatkan oleh konsumen / penggunaE-toll pun.

Bahan-bahan hukum yang diperoleh dianalisis dengan metode deskriptif kualitatif yaitu dengan memaparkan “data yang diperoleh4 dari penelitian1 secara” sistematis kemudian dianalisis untuk memperoleh suatu kesimpulan. Berdasarkan pembahasan maka dapat disimpulkan PT. Jasa Marga Pandaan Tol bertanggung jawab penuh untuk memberikan ganti kerugian atas kesalahan yang dilakukannya dalam pengoperasian pelaksanaan E-toll. Baik kesalahan tersebut ditumbulkan oleh PT Jasa Marga Pandaan selaku pelaksana jalan tol maupun kesalahan yang ditimbulkan dari konsumen demi menjaga standar pelayanan tol sehingga dalam hal ini PT. Jasa Marga menganut suatu teori tanggung jawab mutlak akibat perbuatan melanggar hukum tanpa mempersoalkan kesalahan ( strict liability ). Belum adanya aturan yang jelas mengenai pelaksanaan E-toll serta perlindungan bagi penggunanya membuat pelaksanaan E-toll terkadang menimbulkan beberapa hambatan dalam pelaksanannya selain itu pelaku usaha, PT. Jasa Marga Pandaan Tol berusaha untuk memberikan tanggung jawab pemberian perlindungan kepada konsumen sesuai Standar Operasional Prosedur (SOP).

This research is aimed to investigate the liability of toll company over loss experienced by e-toll users caused by PT. JasaMarga of Pandaan toll according to Law Number 8 of 1999 on Consumer Protection. Empirical juridical method and conceptual approach were employed in this research. The legal materials were analyzed by means of the qualitative descriptive method in which the obtained data were elaborated systematically, followed by an analysis to obtain a conclusion. The research result concludes that PT. Jasa Marga of Pandaan Toll is fully responsible for the compensation for the loss due to either technical error of e-toll operation caused by Jasa Marga or the errors caused by the e-toll users to maintain the standard quality of toll services. PT. Jasa Marga complies with the strict liability theory due to the tort involved. The absence of legal protection is one of the impeding factors regarding the operation of e-toll. Moreover, PT. Jasa Marga of the toll of Pandaan is doing its best to be responsible to provide protection for its customers according to Standard Operational Procedure (SOP).

        "abstract": "This dissertation was written as part of the LLM in Transnational and European Commercial Law, Mediation, Arbitration and Energy Law at the International Hellenic University. The regulation of renewable energy sources and especially renewable electricity has been a highly disputed legal issue. Its particularity lies in their cross-cutting nature of renewable energy sources, in the sense that they affect a variety of policy areas, such as competition, state aid, environmental policy and climate change. The effort of national governments to create incentives for the promotion of renewable electricity production has been materialized through the development of national support schemes. These schemes come, nevertheless, with a number of implications. Not only should these support schemes be in compliance with the current market obligations, but also with the EU state aid and free movement of goods provisions. The role of the European Commission, as well as that of the case law of the European Court of Justice (CJEU) has been vital in providing guiding lines in these complex matters. Against this backdrop, this paper aims to address three fundamental issues in relation to the regulation of renewable electricity at EU level. The first part of the paper presents the legal background of both conventional and renewable electricity markets in the EU and discusses the ‘bindingness’ of the targets imposed by Directive 2009/28/EC. The second part of the paper explores in detail the existing national support schemes for the promotion of RES-E and examines their market compatibility. In the last part, the interaction of national support schemes with State aid and free movement of goods provisions is analyzed, in both cases the starting point being PreussenElektra.",

Oleh karena itu, pasal 2, 3, dan 6 Permenaker No 7 Tahun 2017 tersebut saling bertentangan, sehingga menimbulkan kekaburan terhadap program jaminan sosial yang diwajibkan bagi TKI. Berdasarkan hal tersebut penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis kepastian hukum atas pengaturan program jaminan sosial bagi TKI. Penelitian ini merupakan penelitian hukum dengan menggunakan pendekatan Perundang-undangan dan pendekatan konseptual. Teknik analisis bahan hukum menggunakan interpretasi gramatikal dan interpretasi sistematis. Dari hasil penelitian yang telah dilakukan, penulis berpendapat bahwa Kepastian Hukum pengaturan program jaminan sosial yang wajib diikuti oleh TKI berdasarkan Permenaker No 7 Tahun 2017 seharusnya meliputi program Jaminan JKN, JKK, JKM, dan JHT. Kata Kunci: Kepastian Hukum, Jaminan Sosial, Tenaga Kerja Indonesia (TKI) ABSTRACT This research discusses the regulation of social security program compulsory to all workers in Indonesia according to Regulation of Manpower Minister (Permenaker) Number 7 of 2017. It is mentioned in Article 2 of Permenaker Number 7 of 2017 that several social security programs which involve health insurance (JKN), insurance for work accident (JKK), death security (JKM), and old-age benefit (JHT) are compulsory to workers. On the contrary, it is stated in Article 3 that only JKK and JKM are compulsory, not JHT. According to Article 6, workers are only required to register to JKK, JKM, or JHT. Therefore, Article 2, 3, and 6 of Permenaker Number 7 of 2017 seem to be inconsistent with each other, leading to ambiguity regarding social security compulsory to all workers. This research is categorized as legal research with a statute and conceptual approach. All the legal materials were grammatically and systematically interpreted. The research result suggests that the legal certainty in the regulation of social security compulsory to all workers in Indonesia, according to Permenaker Number 7 of 2017, should involve JKN, JKK, JKM, and JHT. Keywords: legal certainty, social security, Indonesian workers (TKI)",

Bukti-bukti yang sudah ditemukan menunjukkan bahwa yang terjadi pada etnis Rohingya sudah dapat dikatagorikan genosida.

Karaciğer sinüs endotelinde harabiyet sonrası gelişen bir inflamasyon zinciri oluştuğu için son yıllarda “Sinüzoidal Obstrüksiyon Sendromu (SOS)” olarak da adlandırılmaktadır. VOH tanısı klinik bulgular ile konur. Seattle kriterlerine göre; nakil sonrası ilk 20 günde gelişen bilirubin > 2 mg/dL, ağrılı hepatomegali, %2’den fazla ağırlık artışı gibi bulgulardan en az ikisinin olması tanı koydurucudur (1). Baltimore kriterlerine göre ise ilk 21 günde gelişen bilirubin > 2 mg/dL ve şunlardan en az ikisinin varlığı; ağrılı hepatomegali, asit veya > 5 ağırlık artışı VOH tanısı için gereklidir (2). Son yıllarda çocuklarda farklı kriterler geliştirilmesi gündeme gelmiş ve “European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT)” çocuk alt grubu yeni pediatrik kriterler sistemi önermiştir (3). Bu kriterlerde bilirubin yüksekliği olmaksızın, herhangi bir zamanda VOH gelişebileceği vurgulanmaktadır (Tablo 1). VOH gelişimi ile ilgili olarak, viral hepatit veya aşırı demir yüklenmesi, karın bölgesine ışın uygulanması, hazırlama tedavisinde busulfan ve özellikle siklofosfamid ile kombinasyon, ikinci transplantasyon ve altta yatan beta-talasemi, osteopetroz, hemafagositik sendrom, adrenolökodistrofi gibi tanılar risk faktörü olarak rapor edilmiştir (4-8). Hafif ve orta dereceli VOH hastalarının sonucu genellikle iyidir, ancak çoklu organ yetmezliği olan ağır hastalarda mortalite oranı %90’a kadar çıkmaktadır (5). VOH yönetimi, sıvı retansiyonunu önlemek için sıvı kısıtlaması ve diüretik dahil olmak üzere, çoğunlukla destekleyici niteliktedir. Son zamanlarda, defibrotide yeni bir terapötik madde olarak giderek daha fazla kullanılmaktadır ve birçok çalışmada yararlı olduğu bildirilmiştir (5,9-11). Literatürde VOH insidansının %10 ila %60 arasında değişmesine rağmen, pediatrik hematopoetik kök hücre transplantasyonu (HKHT) sonrasında hepatik VOH üzerine sınırlı sayıda çalışma bulunmaktadır (5-9). Bu çalışmada merkezimizde allojenik HKHT sonrası çocuklarda hepatik VOH insidansını ve klinik özelliklerini değerlendirmek amaçlanmıştır.",

The total population surely affects the availability of employment vacancy, and to avoid any possibility of being unemployed, some people decide to work in Saudi Arabia as housemaids. Since working overseas can be challenging and risky, it is deemed essential that legal protection is provided for the Indonesian labors working in domestic sector through the agreement between the Government of Indonesia and the Government of Saudi Arabia related to the placement and protection for Indonesian workforce in the domestic sector. However, the agreement fails to entirely stop infringement affecting the workforce.

Vehicle detection system is used to perform traffic measurement such as tracking, detecting and monitoring vehicles. In Malaysia, Malaysian Highway Authority (MHA) or Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysa (LLM) is a body responsible for conducting the traffic measurement to measure the congestion level of the highway. The congestion data collected can be further used by other official bodies such as traffic police in controlling traffic and Jabatan Kerja Raya (JKR) in route planning and management. However, the vehicle detection systems in Malaysia are not fully automated and many are relying on human to manually monitor the congestion. Motivated by the need of automated vehicle detection system, this project implements a vehicle detection system that consists of a video camera for capturing the vehicles on the road and a sliding window technique developed in Visual C++ to record, detect and count the vehicles.

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Vannia.n.isyrofi@gmail.com Abstrak Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) telah mengeluarkan Surat Edaran Nomor 6/SEOJK.05/2017 yang menggantikan Surat Edaran Nomor SE-06/D.05/2013 dimana Surat Edaran tersebut berisikan tabel batas atas maupun batas bawah premi untuk setiap objek asuransi. KPPU berpandangan adanya SE OJK ini dapat menjadi fasilitas yang bagus untuk melakukan kegiatan monopoli dan hal-hal yang dilarang lainnya sesuai pasal yang disebutkan di Undang-Undang No. 5 Tahun 1999. Semenjak tahun 2013 KPPU telah mengirimkan surat saran kepada OJK berisikan pendapat bahwa regulasi yang telah dibuat oleh OJK tersebut tidak dapat memberikan ruang bagi persaingan sehat bagi industri perasuransian. Pada penelitian ini permasalahan dari polemik antara OJK dan KPPU yang akan diteliti adalah apakah penetapan kebijakan tarif batas bawah premi asuransi sebagaimana diatur dalam Surat Edaran Otoritas Jasa Keuangan  Nomor 6/SE1OJK.05/2017 bertentangan dengan Undang-Undang Nomor 5 Tahun 1999 tentang Larangan Praktek Monopoli dan Persaingan Usaha Tidak Sehat.

KPPU is of the opinion that this SE OJK can be a good facility to conduct monopoly activities and other prohibited things according to the article mentioned in Law no. 5 Year 1999. Since 2013 KPPU has sent a letter of advice to OJK containing the opinion that the regulation that has been made by OJK is not able to give room for healthy competition for insurance industry. In this research the problem of the polemic between OJK and KPPU to be studied is whether the determination of tariff policy of lower limit of insurance premium as regulated in Circular of Financial Services Authority Number 6 / SE1OJK.05 / 2017 is contradictory with Law Number 5 Year 1999 about Prohibition of Practice Monopoly and Unfair Business Competition. However, it is urgent to also gives another approach that is economic analysis or Economic Analysis of Law to law which is recommended by OECD and KPPU.

With statute and case approaches, the research result reveals that a receiver can be categorised as doing tort when he/she deals with bankruptcy if: the receiver is not authorised to perform the activity; not appropriate to perform the activity in the perspective of economy and business;there is no agreement or permit declaring that related parties are in bankruptcy; this is not relevant to procedures in bankruptcy; it is not relevant to norms of law, custom, and social norms. Moreover, according to analogical interpretation and a contario of Article 97 Paragraph (5) of Law on Limited Liability Companies(UUPT), the receiver is responsible for loss caused by: negligence, bad intention and lack of precaution and irrelevance to the objective of the company; direct and indirect conflict of interests which causes loss; no further steps taken to prevent loss that may happen in the future.

Di Indonesia juga terjadi perbedaan pendapat mengenai pemberlakuan hukuman mati. Ada beberapa pengaruh yang timbul di Indonesia, karena penerapan hukuman mati bagi terpidana kasus narkotika, yang paling mencuri perhatian adalah, jika terpidana merupakan WNA, hal tersebut dapat mengundang banyak reaksi dan protes dari negara lain. Dalam penulisan ini, penulis melakukan penelitian mengenai perbedaan penerapan hukuman mati di Australia yang merupakan negara abolisionis dengan Indonesia yang merupakan negara retensionis, serta akibat yang timbul dalam penerapan hukuman mati terhadap warga negara asing atas kejahatan narkotika di Indonesia. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah mengetahui perbedaan penerapan hukuman mati di kedua negara serta akibat yang timbul dari penerapan hukuman mati terhadap warga negara asing atas kejahatan narkotika di Indonesia. Penelitian ini menggunakan motode penelitian yuridis normatif dengan metode pengumpulan data melalui studi dokumen. Data yang diperoleh selama penelitian kemudian diolah dan dianalisa dengan metode kualitatif, sehingga disajikan dalam bentuk pemaparan dan uraian hasil penelitian. Hasil penelitian dari studi kepustakaan menunjukkan bahwa perbedaan penerapan hukuman mati dikarenakan perbedaan sejarah dan ideologi suatu negara, dan didasarkan pada cara pandang masing-masing negara dalam memaknai hukuman mati terutama dikaitkan dengan hak asasi manusia, untuk penjatuhan hukuman mati terhadap kejahatan narkotika juga di dasarkan pada seberapa mengancam kejahatan narkotika di tiap-tiap negara.

ABSTRACT This scientific paper is aimed to investigate the relevance regarding the abrogation of Indonesian language proficiency for foreign workers in Indonesia for the sake of workforce placement management, in which legislation was analyzed. The Regulation of Ministry of Manpower Number 12 of 2013 Article 26 stated that Indonesian language proficiency is the requirement that has to be fulfilled by foreign workers working in Indonesia. However, this requirement has to be abrogated from the Regulation of Ministry of Manpower Number 16 of 2015. This research involved a statute, analytical, and conceptual approaches, while the data was collected by conducting library research and accessing the Internet. The legal materials were then systematically and grammatically interpreted. From the analysis, the result reveals that the abrogation of the requirement in which foreign workers in Indonesia has to be able to communicate in the Indonesian language from the Regulation of the Ministry of Manpower Number 16 of 2015 is not relevant to the main objective of the regulation. This abolishment has impeded knowledge and technological transfer. Moreover, this change cannot guarantee the foreign investment to come to the country.

The Law also regulates what is related to Collective Management organization (further stated as LMK) which is responsible for collecting and distributing royalty. This comparative study attempts to elaborate the regulation required in collecting and mainly distributing royalty of LMK both at local and international level. It is recommended that Government and LMK: a) protect song writers and any parties that hold rights from irresponsible deeds usually related to taking advantage of their rights (piracy). The provision in Article 10 also emphasizes that businesses closely related to using music or any types of entertainment for commercial purpose, such as restaurants, cafes, and similar kinds must assure that the use of the copyright complies with the provision of Law Number 28 Year 2014, b) in collecting royalty of copyright, it is suggested that Singapore can be an example in which song writers could benefit from this collection in terms of economic right.

        "abstract": "Objective: To assess the clinical safety and efficacy of Transhepatic Arterial Chemoembolizations (TACE) with lobaplatin-eluting microspheres in treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Materials and Methods: A total of 70 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and preserved liver function, who were treated with TACE using lobaplatin-eluting microspheres (Group-LEM, as experimental group) or using lobaplatinlipiodol mixtures (Group-LLM, as control group), were evaluated retrospectively. Tumor response was determined with follow-up computed tomography after each chemoembolized procedure according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). The side effects and complications were evaluated by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Results: A database of 70 patients with advanced HCC admitted to Guangdong General Hospital between January 2016 and October 2016 was evaluated retrospectively. Four weeks after TACE procedure, radiological evaluation of tumour response was available in all patients, According to mRECIST, disease control rate (DCR) and objective response rate (ORR) differed significantly between Group-LEM and Group-LLM (60.00% vs 31.43%, and 22.86% vs 2.86%). The most common adverse event was postembolization syndrome (PES), with 18 in Group-LEM and 24 in Group-LLM respectively. Liver dysfunction and thrombocytopenia also had significant difference through comparative analysis between Group-LEM and Group-LLM (8 vs 16, and 1 vs 8). There were neither periprocedural deaths nor adverse events (AEs) of grade 5 documented in all patients. Conclusion: TACE with lobaplatin-eluting microspheres is a safe and feasible treatment without major adverse events in treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the long-term effects of this treatment need further observation.",

Due to the limited number of judges, case backlogs have increased steadily, with the wait time being 854 days in 2017 for the first hearing and much longer for case resolution. The purpose of this case study was to explore the perceptions and attitudes ofImmigration courts in the United Sates are struggling to resolve 610,524 removal proceedings cases with approximately 330 judges located in 58 immigration courts nationwide. Due to the limited number of judges, case backlogs have increased steadily, with the wait time being 854 days in 2017 for the first hearing and much longer for case resolution. The purpose of this case study was to explore the perceptions and attitudes of immigration attorneys about delays in removal proceeding hearings in an immigration court in the southwest. Kettl’s transformation of governance theory served as the theoretical foundation for this study, which explored immigration attorneys’ perceptions about the effects of delays on the welfare of immigrant clients, the effects of delays on client-attorney relationships, and potential solutions to the delay crisis. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with a snowball sample of 10 participants as well as deportation hearing observations and court document reviews. Data were analyzed using the open coding technique. Findings indicated that legal representation was challenging for undocumented immigrants as the lack of proper documents often dissuaded immigrants from seeking legal guidance and they experienced challenges in navigating workplaces, schools, and society. Findings also indicated inadequacies in immigration courts and the need for more funding and resources such as judges, staff training, online application submission system, and judicial system restructuring. The implications for positive social change are directed at immigration policymakers and decision makers as a better understanding of the delay crisis may help them to focus attention and resources in helping to reduce the backlog and improve the judicial process.

        "abstract": "Master’s degree (LLM) in “Comparative and International Dispute Resolution” at Queen Mary University  of London (QMUL) can lead its graduates to a promising career in the field of international arbitration which today  is considered a modern and dynamic dispute resolution tool applicable for both domestic and international business  affairs. The aim of the article is to analyze hallmarks of this LLM programme. The method of analysis and synthesis  of legal and scientific-methodical sources was used to assess the level of the research problem topicality. The method  of generalization was applied to formulate the conclusions of the article. The School of International Arbitration  (SIA) was established in 1985 at Queen Mary University of London. The School has been constantly increasing its  impact over the years, both in terms of research and teaching, and now it is considered a leading contributor to the  science of international arbitration and litigation. Among other options the School proposes the LLM programme  in Comparative and International Dispute Resolution which aims to provide a new generation of lawyers with a  deep understanding of the special characteristics and needs of international arbitration, help them rethink traditional  approaches to conflict resolution what is achieved by a solid theoretical grounding, broad interdisciplinary training,  practice-oriented approach to the teaching of arbitration, enshrining such personal traits as individual commitment,  determination and willingness to work, development of cognitive and transferable skills which help to prepare for the  transition to working life.  The hallmarks of LLM in Comparative and International Dispute Resolution Queen Mary enable a graduate to  become a valuable asset of any organization or institution which activity is connected with international arbitraton.",

        "title": "An efficient two-layer wall model for high Reynolds number large eddy simulation",
        "abstract": "Wall-bounded flows at high Reynolds number are an important research field given that they are present in many important industrial applications. Nonetheless, the use of accurate numerical methodologies such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES) for routine industrial applications, is still unfeasible due to their heavy computational cost. Wall-Modeled LES is intended to circumvent the massive costs of accurately resolving the boundary layer while benefiting from the temporal and spatial resolution of an LES computation. In this work, a Two-Layer Wall Model with a general formulation suitable for non-equilibrium flows and complex geometries is presented. The Two-Layer Models (TLM) suffer from two recurrent problems, the ”log-layer mismatch” (LLM) and the resolved Reynolds stresses inflow (RRSI). Until now, complex and expensive techniques have been proposed to overcome these problems separately. In the present work, a timeaveraging filter (TAF) is considered to deal with both issues at once, with a single and low-computational-cost technique. It is the first time that the TAF technique is used to block the RRSI. In this regard, a numerical experiment is initially performed to assess the TAF ability in doing so. Afterward, the WM is tested in regular operating conditions with a Ret ˜ 3000 pipe flow case. Good results are obtained in all the performed tests, showing the capability of the TAF of suppressing the LLM while avoiding the RRSI at the same time. This makes the new TLM methodology a very effcient technique compared to other implementations proposed so far.",

One of the most significant problems is the number of migrant waves of undocumented migrants.Various internal problems in the country, as well as the narrow land of employment and the easy delivery process, became the main driving factor of the phenomenon. This is unfortunate given the many legal problems that arise for undocumented migrant workers.Rights to the effective remedy of undocumented migrant workers are the primary focus of the author.

        "abstract": "The advanced tokamak scenario with q close to 1 has been achived on HL-2A tokamak, which might be a internal transport barrier (ITB) at low central shear or a steady state ITB combined with H mode edge barrier. In this scenario, formation of internal transport barrier (ITB) with steep Ti profile is observed to be closely linked to the q=1 magnetic surface and MHD activitis around it, suchg as LLM or fishbone. It was found that the q-profile in the core remains flat throughout the ITB period. Such weak central magnetic shear is sustained by the LLM or fishbone activity in addition to bootstrap current, NBI-driven current. Furthermore, applying central ECRF heating and current drive to such beam heated weak shear ITB discharges shows a substantial effect on MHD stability, affecting the passage of the q profile through qmin= 1 and prolonging the weak shear phase, enhancing the strength of ITB with a stronger gradient. Moreover, a stationary advanced tokamak scenario with ITBs in combination with an H mode barrier and weak shear (qmin ~1) was maintained for 40 confinement times and several internal skin times with β N = 2.0. In the ITB/H mode scenario, (1,1) fishbones can not only clamp the current profile development near the q = 1 surface without causing energy confinement to deteriorate but also induce a polodial flow which is beneficial to the suppression of turbulence in the plasma core region.",

ABSTRACT The issue discussed in this research is related to the relevance of Article 3 Paragraph (1) of Government Regulation Number 54 Year 2007 regarding an adopted child of the same religion as the foster parents’ as part of the regulation of child adoption provided in Article 2 of Government Regulation Number 54 of 2007. This research employed statute and conceptual approach, and the result revealed that this issue could be seen as either relevant or not relevant to some extent when aspects of child protection are taken into account. Regarding the children education, it is essential that the concept of the same religion be adjusted to the education the child receives. Child protection in terms of health, social rights, special protection, protection of their clothing, housing, and law will not be relevant when there is still a concept of the same religion. Adopting children of the same religion must be reasonable and the solution to the absence of adoption, if any, should also be considered. Different religion of either the parents or the adopted child should be allowed recalling that the main purpose of the adoption is to support the welfare ofand protection for the adopted child. Therefore, there should be no issue that could create a barrier regarding the adoption. Keywords : relevance, religion, adoption, welfare, child protection.",

Dewasa ini tindak pidana korupsi dilakukan Lembaga Swadaya Masyarakat. Disini penulis menggunakan jenis penelitian yuridis normatif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan, dan pendekatan kasus. Ketua Lembaga Kepedulian Muslim Maluku(LK-2M),  Melakukan tindak pidana korupsi dengan dalil menyelesaikan perkara tapal batas antara Kabupaten Seram Bagian Barat dengan Kabupaten Maluku Tengah. Pada putusan Pengadilan Tindak Pidana Korupsi pada Pengadilan Negeri Ambon menjatuhkan terdakwa dengan Pasal 3 Undang-Undang Nomor 20 Tahun 2001 Tentang Perubahan Atas Undang-Undang Nomor 31 Tahun 1999 Tentang Pemberantasan Tindak Pidana Korupsi, bahwa terdakwa melakukan tindakan tersebut dengan menyalahgunakan kewenangan sebagai ketua LK-2M. Pada Putusan Pengadilan Tindak Pidana Korupsi pada Pengadilan Tinggi Ambon tidak sependapat dengan putusan sebelumnya, dan menjerat Terdakwa dengan pasal 2. Mahkamah Agung memiliki pendapat yang sama dengan Pengadilan Tinggi bahwa terdakwa tidak dapat memenuhi unusur-unsur dalam pasal 3. Sehingga menolak permohonan kasasi oleh Terdakwa dan memperkuat Putusan Pengadilan Tinggi Ambon. Lembaga Swadaya Masyarakat dapat dikategorisasikan sebagai subjek hukum Korporasi dalam koridor tindak pidana korupsi, di sisi lain tidak semua pihak dapat dianggap melakukan penyalahgunaan wewenang dalam hal tindak pidana korupsi.

Not only is it restricted to civil servants or government officials, but nowadays the corruption is also committed by non-government organizations. The normative juridical research method was used, supported by statute and case approaches. The head of Lembaga Kepedulian Muslim Maluku (LK-2M) was involved in corruption by settling the boundary-related issue between the Regency of Seram of the west part and the Regency of Central Maluku. Based on the corruption court decision, the district court of Ambon has charged the defendant guilty with Article 3 of Act Number 20 of 2001 on Amendment of Act Number 31 of 1999 on Corruption Eradication. The defendant was found to misuse his authority as the head of LK-2M. It can be seen that the decision made by the district court of Ambon is not in line with the previous decision, and it punishes the defendant based on Article 2. Supreme Court and High Court agree that the defendant fails to meet the criteria mentioned in Article 3. It rejects cassation submitted by the defendant and strengthens the Decision by the District Court of Ambon. Not all parties of the non-government organization are involved in corruption. In this case, the Head of LK-2M as a defendant does not meet the criteria of misusing authority, opportunity, or facilities given to him.

Previous research has indicated a strong correlation between vote-buying and underinvestment and poor delivery of public services. There remains, however, a significant gap in the current literature regarding the nature of the relationship between vote-selling and the delivery of public services. The purpose of this study was to uncover voters’ behaviors by investigating their common and lived experiences with respect to the provision of infrastructure, delivery of public services, and voting during elections. Using Bandura’s theory of reciprocal determinism, the research explored the connection between environment and vote-selling. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 10 individuals who participated in the most recent elections in Akoko North West Local Government, Ondo State, Nigeria. The data were analyzed using Moustakas’s transcendental phenomenological process. Key findings suggest a reciprocal relationship between vote-selling, and infrastructure and public services. The study findings also revealed that vote-sellers’ feel justified because vote-selling is perceived as a product of disappointment, lack of trust and voters’ apathy, willingness to accept their own share of “national cake,” and poverty. These findings are consistent with Bandura’s proposition that people create the society and equally react to environmental factors.

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Aldiansyah0912@gmail.com ABSTRAK Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat hubungan hukum yang lahir dari perjanjian antara pemain timnas sepak bola Indonesia dengan PSSI. Mengingat PSSI memberikan suatu pekerjaan kepada pemain sepak bola untuk bermain dalam kompetisi Internasional. Namun hukum yang digunakan masih belum dapat ditentukan antara Undang-Undang Nomor 13 Tahun 2003 Tentang Ketenagakerjaan atau KUHPerdata. Melihat hubungan hukum kedua pihak terjadi kekaburan hukum terkait hubungan hukum yang terjadi, maka perlu dilihat dari perjanjian yang dibuat kedua pihak apakah dapat dikatakan perjanjian kerja sehingga menimbulkan suatu hubungan kerja dengan melihat unsur-unsur hubungan kerja dalam perjanjian atau perjanjian jasa tertentu yang meninmbulkan hubungan hukum perdata. Pada dasarnya penelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian peraturan perundang-undangan( statute-approach ), konseptual ( conseptual-approach ), dan analisis ( analytical-approach ) dengan teknik analisis studi kepustakaan ( library research ). Hasil penelitian yang dapat disimpulkan bahwa Hubungan hukum yang terjadi adalah hubungan keperdataan bukan hubungan kerja karena dalam perjanjian yang dibuat PSSI dan pemain timnas sepak bola Indonesia tidak memenuhi  dua unsur hubungan kerja. Dalam perjanjian yang dibuat hanya memenuhi unsur pekerjaan. Unsur upah dan perintah tidak terpenuhi. Hal tersebut didukung dengan subjek hukumnya yaitu pemain timnas dan PSSI tidak termasuk subjek hukum ketenagakerjaan yaitu pekerja dan pemberi kerja. Perjanjian yang dibuat kedua pihak adalah perjanjian melakukan jasa tertentu yang diatur dalam pasal 1601 ayat 1 KUHPerdata yang melahirkan hubungan hukum perdata. Kata kunci: hubungan hukum, pemain timnas sepak bola Indonesia ABSTRACT This research is aimed to study the legal relationship that comes up between Indonesian Football National Team (Timnas) and Indonesian Football Players Federation (PSSI), recalling that PSSI hires football players to play at international level. However, the law used to regulate this relationship is not yet determined between Law Number 13 of 2003 on Labour Affairs and Civil Code. It is perceived that there is ambiguity of law in the legal relationship between the two. It is, therefore, essential to see whether the contract made between the two parties could be categorised as employment contract where there should be determining elements of work relationship contained therein or it is a contract of a particular service that creates a civil relationship. This research employed statute, conceptual, and analytical approaches, where the analytical method involved library research. The research result concludes that there is a civil relationship serving as the legal relationship, not work relationship, for the contract made by the two parties does not fulfill any requirements of work relationship contract, but rather the relationship between the two parties involves services as regulated in Article 1601 Paragraph 1 of Civil Code in relation to the civil relationship.

International analyses and rankings rate the CSME countries’ performance as poor in comparison with others at the same level of economic development. This results in negative impacts on the economic and social welfare of their communities. A paucity of data existed concerning the effects of policies on decisions by local firms to engage in innovation and technology activities. The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine the effects of policies on IPRs, innovation, and technology on firms in select CSME countries. The questions addressed how IPRs policies affect the choices of innovation activities by firms, and what differences in IPRs policies in Guyana, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica, influence the decisions by firms to invest in innovation and technologies. Landes and Posner’s utilitarian exposition that IPRs should be based on the maximization of social welfare provided the theoretical framework for the study. Various policy papers, firm studies, study reports, and legislation from government and international agencies were analyzed using 4 levels of inductive coding. Findings included a lack of clear IPRs policies, high levels of innovation where policies were weakest, and a general reluctance by firms in the countries to invest in innovation and technology.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT One of the primary challenges for a law lecturer is to take students beyond their own assumptions about the parameters of a subject and provide them with new opportunities for exploration and a broader vision to enhance learning. A significant feature of law as a discipline of study in higher education that has the potential to impact on the curriculum and the way in which it is taught is the academic/vocational divide. Problem-based learning (PBL) activities make classroom settings unpredictable and surprising, and learning to deal with such uncertainty prepares students for one of the most crucial aspects of professional life: the ability to make judgements in a context of uncertainty. This article analyses the integration of PBL within an LLM module on International Commercial Dispute Resolution. The logic of using PBL in this module is to ensure that the more abstract and less engaging aspects of the course are learned in relation to a close involvement with problems that are highly relevant to students’ more concrete ideas of what the course is about and what competence would mean within it. The experience of the students with the PBL activities, captured in reflective narratives and anonymous questionnaires, is also discussed.",

        "abstract": "This article proposes a revision to the ‘Green List’, sections 4.3.1 and 4.4.4 of the International Bar Association (IBA) Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration 2014. It argues that the classification of social media relationships for disclosure requirements should be divided into two categories: (i) connections on professional and (ii) general social network sites, based on the functionalities of the platform’s features. The article then suggests that social media mining can be used for assessing challenges based on social media relationship with quantitative analysis on close personal relationship between an arbitrator and a party or counsel that * Suar Sanubari, Senior Associate, Dispute Resolution, Hiswara Bunjamin & Tandjung. suar.sanubari@hbtlaw. com. The views expressed in this article are solely those of the author. The author would like to thank Professor Stavros Brekoulakis who encouraged writing about the topic, as well as fellow LLM programme students Scott Charles Schubert and Chloe Stonex-Bonnet, Mary Mitsi the Teaching and Research Fellow at Queen Mary University of London, and Antony Crockett of Herbert Smith Freehills, as well as JIDS anonymous reviewers who read and commented the draft. Credit is also given to Lembaga Pengelola Dana Pendidikan (the Endowment Education Fund) of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Indonesia for supporting the author financially with full scholarships for his LLM studies, and to Lubis Santosa & Maramis for the additional stipends. The author also benefited from the Alumni and Friends of School of International Arbitration Conference 2015 hosted by Norton Rose Fulbright. The author would like to thank Ayaz Ibrahimov specifically for choosing the topic submitted by the author for the panel discussion, thus allowing the topic to be discussed by reputable arbitration experts and practitioners. The author was fascinated by how social media data can and have been used for researches in psychology, sociology, anthropology and marketing from the first time he introduced to such notion. That was when he was working on a social media defamation case, during which he had the privilege of meeting Roby Muhamad, one of the researchers in Columbia University’s Small World Project, who was presented as expert in the hearing. The author himself is a social media user. As a millennial, it seems natural for the author to join the ranks of the ‘Hashtag Generation’. The author is an active user of Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and Path. The author uses and relies on social media heavily, yet is wary of connection addiction. The author understands social media should support offline social life. However, the attachment to them may even degrade offline social life. The author tries to limit his time spent social media. Nevertheless, he can never completely detach himself from their use. Social media has become an integral part of the author’s life. One fine example is this article. The author posted a thought on 11 July 2015: ‘So I am writing an article [about] social media. I’m doing most of my research on social media. Being distracted in between writing by social media. And recording my thoughts and feelings on social media.’ Therefore, the topic is not just novel, but also interesting and relevant to modern life. The advantage of a novel topic is the freedom to explore it and create new original ideas. Obviously, the biggest challenge is the lack of reference materials. The author knows from the start that he would have to look beyond law to write this article. Fortunately, social media removed many barriers in searching for the reference materials. The author managed to access online journals for various scientific disciplines. Reading interdisciplinary scientific subjects was not an easy feat for the author. However, the author found the efforts to be exhilarating and rewarding. VC The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The article also explores the possibilities of social media mining for profiling arbitrators. Lastly, the article discusses the concerns related to social media mining and proposes social media mining procedure for arbitration to address them. 1 . I N T R O D U C T I O N The use of social media, specifically social network sites, by arbitrators as legal professionals may create issues regarding conflicts of interest. Arbitrators’ conduct and virtual relationships with parties or counsel on social media may arouse questions about their independence and impartiality. There have been several scholarly suggestions about how an arbitrator (in performing his/her dual roles as service provider and judicial function) should approach social media. These range from total abstinence to limited and controlled use. Prohibiting arbitrators from using social media is the safest way to avoid conflicts of interest or suspicion about the lack of independence and impartiality. However, such prohibition will deprive arbitrators of the professional advantages in their role as service providers, particularly networking and marketing. Given the proliferation of social media in every aspect of life, the total abstinence approach is not a suitable one for the modern world. Even if the proponents of complete prohibition of social media use by arbitrators support their arguments by emphasizing an arbitrator’s judicial function, it should be noted that many of the judicial ethics committees in the United States and the American Bar Association (ABA) do not endorse such an approach for judges. The majority consensus is that judges may participate in social media with certain caveats. The International Bar Association (IBA) Guidelines on Conflict of Interests in International Arbitration (the ‘Guidelines’), the soft law that will be the main focus of this article, and International Principles on Social Media Conduct for the Legal Profession 2014 are also strong indications of the acceptance of social media use by arbitrators within the legal professions. Therefore, a permissible but controlled approach is more suitable to current developments in legal practice. The permissible approach requires further elaboration on the limitation and control aspects. The Guidelines simply classify any social media relationship between arbitrators and parties or counsel in the ‘Green List’. This means the connection will never lead to disqualification under the objective test and need not be disclosed. However, it is important to take into account the debate on social media relationships during the panel discussion of 2013 IBA’s Annual Meeting that gave rise to the 1 JE Kalicki and M Silberman, ‘Social Media and Conflict of Interests: A Challenge for the 21st Century’ (Kluwer Arbitration Blog, 23 April 2012) <http://kluwerarbitrationblog.com/blog/2012/04/23/socialmedia-and-arbitration-conflicts-of-interest-a-challenge-for-the-21st-century/> accessed 16 February 2015. 2 CV Harvey, MR McCoy and B Sneath, ‘10 Tips for Avoiding Ethical Lapses when Using Social Media’ Business Law Today (January 2014) 11 <http://www.americanbar.org/publications/blt/2014/01/ 03_harvey.html> accessed 5 December 2016. 3 IBA, Guidelines on Conflict of Interests in International Arbitration 2014 Part II, Green List, ss 4.3.1 and 4.4.4. 4 ibid, Explanation to General Standard 3. 2 Arbitrator’s Conduct by gest on Jauary 0, 2017 http://jidsrdjournals.org/ D ow nladed from Guidelines (the ‘Meeting’). Lawrence Schaner suggested that most cases of social media connections do not represent real and actual relationships. Hillary Heilbron QC opined that the issue of disclosure is about the nature of a particular relationship, not the source. Therefore, social media relationships in the ‘Green List’ must not undermine the general principle if an arbitrator finds him/herself in a circumstance that needs to be disclosed. Basically, the discussions on disclosure revolve around whether an arbitrator who has a social media connection with a party or a counsel also has a real (offline) relationship that may give rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the arbitrator. The Meeting acknowledged that shunning social media would deprive arbitrators of a medium to market themselves. Moreover, exchanging contacts via social media has become just as much an acceptable business practice as the exchange of business cards, particularly for the younger generation of lawyers. It is also interesting to note that only LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter—the most popular social media platforms—were mentioned in the discussion. Furthermore, the report on the Meeting has no record of any discussion on the definition and scope of social media. As this article elaborates in the next sections, social media can exist in various forms and hold different features that represent several functionalities. The absence of discussions on what social media is during the Meeting may be an indication of a limited understanding of social media among arbitration practitioners. The Meeting also did not discuss any case precedent of a challenge based on social media relationships. One of the first known cases involving a challenge based on a social media relationship was EURL Tecso v Neoelectra SAS Group. In that case, Tecso petitioned for an award to be set aside to the French courts. One of the arguments raised was the fact that the President of the Tribunal was a Facebook ‘friend’ of the counsel of Neoelectra. Furthermore, the counsel of Neoelectra ‘liked’ the President of the Tribunal’s Facebook page that was set up for his Paris Bar el",

(Mahfud, S.H., LLM.) Perkembangan dan pemanfaatan ilmu pengetahuan dan teknologi yang demikian pesat belakangan ini, menimbulkan berbagai permasalahan hukum. Salah satu perbuatan melawan hukum adalah pemuatan unsur-unsur pornografi dalam siaran yang dilakukan penyiar dalam media sosial bigo live, yang mana gamba atau aksi streaming yang disajikan tersebut mayoritas mengeksploitasi tubuh wanita. Dan hal ini akan berdampak terhadap perkembangan sikap dan mental masyarakat. Untuk mengatasi pelanggar pornografi tersebut pelaku dijerat dengan Pasal 27 ayat (1) Jo pasal 45 ayat (1) UU ITE dan Pasal 4 ayat (1) Jo Pasal 27 UU Pornografi. Meskipun sudah diatur dalam peraturan perundang-undangan, namun pelaku masih saja menyajikan aksi atau gambar streamingnya yang mengandung unsur pornografi. Hal ini terjadi karena mengingat adanya fitur gift (hadiah) yang diberikan aplikasi bigo live yang membuat penyiar rela melakukan aksi yang bahkan vulgar. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk menjelaskan perbuatan pornografi terhadap pelaku penggunaan aplikasi streaming bigo live memenuhi unsur tindak pidana pornografi dalam UU ITE dan UU Pornografi dan pertanggungjawaban pelaku tindak pidana pornografi terhadap penyalahgunaan aplikasi streaming bigo live dalam UU Pornografi dan UU ITE. Metode penelitian yang digunakan yaitu penelitian normatif, yang mana data diperoleh dengan studi kepustakaan/data sekunder, yaitu dengan membaca dan menelaah buku-buku, peraturan perundang-undangan dan hasil-hasil penelitian sebelumnya. Hasil penelitian menyangkut bahan diatas yaitu perbuatan pelaku aplikasi streaming bigo live termasuk dalam muatan yang melanggar kesusilaan dan dapat dikelompokkan dalam tindak pidana pornografi, yang mana perbuatan pelaku penyalahgunaan bigo live memenuhi unsur pornografi yang sudah diatur dalam UU ITE dan UU Pornografi. Pertanggungjawaban pelaku dalam UU ITE dan UU Pornografi didasarkan pada asas culpabilitas “tidak dipidana apabila tidak terdapat kesalahan”. Namun hal ini pelaku penyalahgunaan bigo live telah memenuhi unsur kesalahan sehingga pelaku dapat dibebankan pertanggungjawaban pidana padanya. Disarankan kepada pemerintah dapat memperhatikan media sosial yang disalahgunakan masyarakat dan harus memberikan sanksi tegas bagi para pengguna aplikasi bigo live yang melakukan siaran yang mengandung unsur pornografi.",

        "abstract": "The contribution of the LIBOR Market Model (LLM) by Brace, Gatarek, Musiela [1997] and Miltersen, Sandmann, and Sondermann [1997] is its justification of using the BS model in the cap market. This convenience has helped the industry incredibly in that a simple solution is enough to price caps (and floors). Yet this convenience comes with a price, which is that its drift adjustment under the forward measure is unconstructive. Furthermore, assuming LIBOR to be log-normal surrenders the flexibility that recent LIBOR is normally distributed. In this paper, we provide an alternative to reformulate the LLM so that both concerns are addressed easily. Not only can LIBOR distribution switch between normal and log-normal, but also the drift adjustment is no longer stochastic and instead easy to implement. We also show how to translate the “Black vol” (the volatility implied by the Black model) and the “bp vol” (known as the basis point volatility). Empirically we have observed that when rates are low, the basis point volatility is more stable (i.e., they follow the normal distribution more closely) and when they are high the Black volatility is more stable (i.e., they follow the log-normal distribution more closely). We derive also specifically how the cap volatility curve (Tj × Tj+1 only) is related to the swaption volatility surface(Ti × Tj). We also comment on the swap measure.",

        "abstract": "On high voltage power lines the bare hand method is the commonly used live-line maintenance (LLM) working technology. In different standards and regulations different clearances can be found. Although the calculation of minimal approach distance is similar in each method, it depends on the magnitude of transient overvoltage. To limit the possible peak of overvoltage, portable protective air gap (PPAG) can be used. The PPAG acts as a spark gap: if a sufficiently high voltage occurs between the two electrodes of the equipment, a dielectric breakdown appears. This voltage is not an exact value: at each voltage level, breakdown has a given probability, which depends on several properties of the spark gap and its surroundings. The time needed for the formation of a sparkover is short. In some cases, the time of formation and the velocity of discharges is not negligible: it is important to ensure that the protective air gap responds earlier against an overvoltage than the formation of the spontaneous breakdown at the worksite. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of these properties on the breakdown phenomenon and the influence on different kinds of spark gaps connected parallel to each other.",

        "title": "Relevance of Measuring Substances in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid for Detecting Aspiration-associated Extraesophageal Reflux Disease",
        "abstract": "c 2017 The Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility J Neurogastroenterol Motil, Vol. 23 No. 2 April, 2017 www.jnmjournal.org TO THE EDITOR: We read with great interest the paper by Özdemir et al on the assay of lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) in broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with chronic cough as a marker of micro-aspiration of refluxate into airways. The authors found that patients with abnormal extra-esophageal reflux as measured by 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring had higher LLM positivity in BAL specimens than those with normal reflux and, accordingly, they suggested that this BAL finding should be used to diagnose aspiration in reflux-related chronic cough. The measurement of LLMs from BAL specimens is one of the most widely used tests to identify aspiration-associated extraesophageal reflux disease (AERD), particularly in children. This test is based on the hypothesis that the refluxate is phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages and that staining for those in the BAL fluid would verify the presence of AERD. However, previous studies have demonstrated conflicting results, because an increase in LLMs has been observed not only in reflux patients, but also in those without reflux and in any disorder leading to pulmonary inflammation. On the other hand, search for pepsin and bile acids in BAL has been shown to represent a more valid and specific biomarker of micro-aspiration in patients with objective evidence of abnormal reflux burden since, up to now, no studies have measured their presence in BAL of healthy volunteers or in patient-controls without evidence of reflux disease. Thus, the detection of the above substances in BAL has been considered overall as a strong confirmation of gastric contents coming up from the stomach into the airways. Ozdemir et al stated that BAL pepsin levels have been studied very poorly to diagnose gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) in patients with respiratory symptoms and quote the only investigation by Decalmer et al, in which the authors found in controls lower levels of pepsin than those detected in chronic cough patients. However, it must be emphasized that in this study various respiratory conditions beyond GERD were considered to elucidate the presence of unexplained chronic cough and this may have been an important confounding factor. In our laboratory the detection of pepsin and bile acids in BAL of patients with GERD was also performed in a recent study using impedance-pH monitoring, which is nowadays considered to be the best test for measuring gastroesophageal reflux, also in cases of atypical manifestations of GERD. We found that patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had significantly higher esophageal acid exposure and greater number of acid refluxes than controls, but also that weakly acidic refluxes were remarkably increased. Moreover, more bile acids and pepsin were measured in BAL as a sound marker of gastric aspiration in the upper airways of these patients. Further studies carried out in patients with various pulmonary conditions corroborated our findings. So far, we would like to emphasize that the detection of various substances in BAL can be of great help in the diagnosis of microaspiration of refluxate which is able to induce chronic cough and other respiratory symptoms, but the assay of bile acids or pepsin levels seems to provide us with a more valid and reliable marker of contents reaching the larynx and pharynx from the stomach.",

Penelitian ini menggunakan metode yuridis normatif. Hasil penelitian adalah kewenangan dalam pemberian sanksi antara temporary insider dan traditional insider disamakan karena meskipun durasi waktu kedua kategori berbeda, namun bisa jadi informasi materil yang disampaikan dapat menimbulkan kerugian yang sama dengan kejahatan insider trading yang dilakukan oleh tradisional insider . Dengan adanya kerugian yang dialami oleh investor akibat adanya insider trading oleh temporary insider membuat pihak emiten yang mempunyai hubungan hukum dengan investor dapat dikenai vicarious liability . Hal ini dikarenakan pihak temporary insider merupakan pihak yang berada dalam ruang lingkup emiten, sehingga apabila terjadi kesalahan atau kerugian maka yang bertanggung jawab adalah emiten.

It’s clear that by virtue of International Law of The Sea (UNCLOS), China’s historic claim over maritime areas (water column, seabed and subsoil, low tide elevations and submerged features), such right is not recognized. While the legal basis of China’s claim is unquestionable, the preliminary findings that led to the hypothesis of this research suggest that China’s historic claim was derived from the concept of historic waters as well as historic title that gives the birth towards the traditional fishing ground alluded on the Article 15 UNCLOS, supported by China’s self-proclaimed occupation of much of the areas of South China Sea for more than 2000 years. This research would also examine the element of “history” as the basis of their claim, China’s historic claim comprise of two broad aspect: a historic basis of sovereignty and a historic claim over maritime areas in the South China Sea. China has asserted that they will not participate on the proceedings and neither obey the final decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, however such actions is not a bar for the proceedings. On the other hand, the talk between ASEAN and China over the dispute started in 1994 but give no clear direction upon the binding-agreement of the Code of Conduct (COC) between two parties. The willingness of the parties to bind themselves emerged on the 2002 Declaration of Conduct, but the slow progress has worsen the situation and many unanswered problems still remained, hence, this research would also examined the dispute settlement mechanism of the two parties by focusing the discussion on the internal problems within ASEAN. The method used on this research is juridical normative combined with statute approach and conceptual approach. The research will then deeply analyze the relevant document as the primary legal material such as the Tribunal verdict of PCA Case Number 2013-19 Arbitration between China and the Phillipines, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), ASEAN Charter, Declaration of Conduct 2002. The secondary legal material includes Journal from legal scholars, relevant and credible sources from the internet as well as other relevant documents. The research concluded that the term and the usage of historic rights could not be partially applied to specific things, but shall cover the entire sovereignty of their claimed-area comprehensively. In regards to ASEAN, the research showed that there is an internal issue of disunity and distrust among ASEAN member states, it is stipulated by the decisions of the Phillipines of bringing the case before the PCA without prior negotiation as what agreed on the consensus principle of the member states.

        "title": "Risk Regulation: Hic et Ubique",
        "abstract": "My first encounter with risk regulation occurred through my LLM and PhD research at NYU School of Law. I had had an interest in the balancing of trade liberalization and social regulatory objectives already during my undergraduate studies at the LSE where I had the privilege of studying European Union law with Damian Chalmers. During my LLM, I wrote a term paper on the WTO Appellate Body’s EC-Hormones decision. This dispute was the first to be adjudicated under the WTO’s Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures by a young Appellate Body. The SPS Agreement requires WTO members which do not use international standards for their domestic regulation to justify their higher levels of protection with scientific evidence. I quickly realised that the decision raised important questions about the extent to which law or judges can set sensible threshold levels of scientific proof and that the decision how stringently to regulate inevitably requires political judgment that is difficult to review judicially. As I had been engrossed by the report and relevant literature, I decided to make the regulation of risk through the WTO’s Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement the topic of my PhD. At the suggestion of my then supervisor Philippe Sands, I refined my research topic to focus on the regulation of agricultural biotechnology through WTO law. This subject not only raised the above questions in a general manner but also a set of unique questions about the proper method to assess the risks of genetically modified organisms (GMO), a question of consumer sovereignty to choose GM-free products despite potential benefits of GMOs, including for developing countries, and the question whether the irreversibility of release into the environment of GMOs calls for special precautions. I understood that the production of epistemologically valid scientific evidence requires a certain detachment from real world conditions, which limits its analytical usefulness for real world problems. Science is also fallible and what scientific evidence is produced hinges on framings, conventions and financial rewards for research. As a result of its necessary inferences, potential for error and social bias, I argued epistemological standards can only ever provide a partial justification for regulatory action and need supplementary justification on the basis of genuine normative argument about what is reciprocally acceptable.",

UB Faculty of Law devilzeight@gmail.com Abstract Rapid technological developments lead to new criminal offenses. One of which is internet piracy of songs, films, papers, etc. The research problems raised are what forms of legal protection should be granted by the state in regard with cinematographic piracy offenses via the Internet, as well as whether the offender can be convicted of cinematographypiracy. The state has provided protection through Act no. 28 year 2014 on copyright, namely in article 9, paragraph (1) of the exclusive right of the creator to his creation, and article 40 paragraph (1) of the forms of creation that is protected by Indonesia, Article 113 paragraph (3) regarding sanctions for perpetrators of criminal acts of piracy; Act no.11 of 2008 onelectronic information and transactions, namely article 27 paragraph (1) concerning distribution of electronic documents  which violate decency. Based on the explanation of forms of legal protection provided by the State, the crime ofmovie piracy can be imprisoned for Article 9, paragraph (1) point b stating that the doubling of creation in any form . It means that it already covers over the internet as well and in article 113 paragraph (3 ) on sanctions for perpetrators of piracy. It can be concluded that the country has provided  copyright protection against cinematography piracy offenses through law no.28 year 2014 on copyright as well as the Law no. 11 of 2008 on electronic information and transactions.

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Jalan MT Haryono 169 Malang Email: 135010107121007@mail.ub.ac.id ABSTRAK Ketenagakerjaan di Indonesia tidak memiliki peraturan yang mengatur mengenai perjanjian kerja paruh waktu. Perjanjian kerja dalam undang-undang ketenagakerjaan terbagi menjadi 2 (dua) yaitu perjanjian kerja waktu tertentu (PKWT) dan perjanjian kerja waktu tidak tertentu (PKWTT). Tidak adanya peraturan yang mengatur mengenai paruh waktu membuat kebingungan bagi pelaku dalam ketenagakerjaan. Posisi pekerja yang lemah membuat pekerja lebih rentan mendapatkan kesewenang-wenangan, maka dari itu membutuhkan perlindungan. Terdapat hukum yang berlaku internasional yang dapat dijadikan acuan yaitu Part-Time Work Convention No. 75, 1994. Di dalam konvensi terdapat beberapa ketentuan mengenai pekerja paruh waktu diantaranya adalah waktu kerja, pengupahan, dan masa berlaku perjanjian kerja paruh waktu, Waktu kerja pekerja paruh waktu dapat dilihat dari pengertiannya yaitu pekerja yang waktu kerja normalnya kurang dari waktu kerja normal dari pekerja waktu penuh yang sebanding. Upah yang diterima oleh pekerja paruh waktu didasarkan dari kehadiran dan dihitung secara proporsional mengacu pada upah pekerja waktu penuh yang sebanding. Mengenai masa berlaku perjanjian kerja paruh waktu, berdasarkan analisis mengenai peraturan perundang-undangan yang berlaku di Indonesia yaitu Undang-Undang Ketenagakerjaan dan Kepmenakertrans No. 100 Tahun 2004, maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa masa berlaku perjanjian kerja paruh waktu adalah maksimal 3 tahun. Hal ini memberikan kepastian hukum mengenai hubungan kerja paruh waktu. Agar dapat dijadikan hukum nasional, maka pemerintah perlu melaksanakan ratifikasi konvensi mengenai paruh waktu sebagai langkah awal pembuatan atau pembaruan peraturan perundang-undangan yang mengatur tentang paruh waktu. Kata Kunci: Perlindungan hukum, perjanjian kerja paruh waktu ABSTRACT Employment in Indonesia does not have rules which regulate part-time job contract. Employment agreement falls into two categories namely Fixed Term Employment Contract (FTEC) and Unspecified Time Work Contract (UTWC). The absence of regulation governing part time job creates confusion in employment.the position of workers is weak and makes them vulnarable to injustice deed. Thus, they need protection. There is an international law that can be used as reference which is Part Time Work Convention no 75, 1994. The convention contains some provisions regarding time of work, wage, and validity of the contract. As its name suggests, part time work takes less then the duration of full time work. the wage received is based on the attendance and proportionally calculated by refering to the salary received by full time workers. Concerning to the validity of the contract for part time work, based on the analysis on the legislation that is applicable in Indonesia which is The Law of Employment and the Decree of the Minister of Manpower and Transmigration no 100 year 2014, the contract of part time job is valid for at maximum 3 years. This provides legal certainty for part time workers. In order to make it a national law, government needs to do convention ratificationas an early stage of the formulation or renewal of legislation governing part time work.

Untuk memberantas kejahatan terorisme tentu tidak dapat hanya dengan mengedepankan aspek hukum yang bersifat reaktif berupa penindakan, melainkan juga harus mengedepankan upaya preventif atau pencegahan. Upaya pencegahan mutlak dibutuhkan sebagai bentuk deteksi dini dalam memberantas kejahatan terorisme. Sebab, Tindak pidana terorisme merupakan kejahatan yang kompleks dari tahapan persiapan, perencanaan, sampai pada tahap pelaksanaan. Upaya pencegahan juga sebagai langkah untuk memutus pergerakan teroris yang terus berevolusi mengalami perkembangan yang cukup signifikan, dari pola aksi terorisme tradisional hingga sampai pada pola aksi terorisme modern. Selain itu, maraknya aksi terorisme bukanlah semata-mata berpangkal pada aksi kekerasan ataupun aksi kejahatan belaka. Melainkan, aksi-aksi terorisme yang terjadi lebih kepada sebuah keyakinan teologis, dimana kejahatan terorisme dipercaya sebagai bentuk perjuangan dari ideologi yang diyakini (jihad). Sementara undang-undang nomor 15 tahun 2003 tidak dapat menjangkau perbuatan sebelum tindak pidana terorisme dilakukan, karena ketiadaan mengenai pengaturan pencegahan tindak pidana terorisme.

Abstract Terrorism in a crime which threats the sovereignity of a country and the prosperity of all elements of society. The fight againts terrorism can be done not only by putting forward the aspect of law that reactive in the form of punishment imposition, but also by putting forward the preventive action. Preventive action is absolutely needed as aform of early detection for terrorism erradication. It is because terrorism is acomplex crime involving the stages of preparation, planning, and implemention. Prevention is also a way of cutting off the terrorism movement which keeps evolving significantly from traditional to modern terrorism movement. Besides, the act of terrorism is not based only on violence. It is also based on the theological belief in which terrorism is believed to be the form of struggle based on the ideology of their belief (jihad). Law number 15 yar 2003 cannot regulate an act before terrorism is commited because of the absence of the regulation on terrorism act. Thus, terrorism must be prevented early.

        "abstract": "This dissertation was written as part of the LLM in Transnational and European Commercial Law, Mediation, Arbitration and Energy Law at the International Hellenic University, aiming to provide a comprehensive and thorough review of the essentials of the Judicial Mediation in Greece. It is undisputable that conflict lies at the heart of the democratic process. The most innovative decisions are engendered by productive dialogue that explores different proposals and views with main aim the creative solutions. That is why it is more than challenging to transformation of the conflict from a destructive and adversarial battling to a creative solution of a problem. In the framework of ensuring a balanced relationship between Mediation and Judicial Proceedings, the European Parliament adopted Directive 2008/52/EC on May 21, 2008 under its EU target for obtaining alternative ways of resolving civil and commercial disputes. Greek legislation was not unfamiliar with ways of resolving the dispute out of court or by means of lawsuits. Mediation was established in Greece by the Greek Mediation Act 3898/2010 (hereafter GrMA) as an alternative way of resolving private disputes. The GrMA 3898/2010 did not provide for judicial mediation. Though the issue of genuine judicial mediation was the topic of discussion and concern for the Committee set up for the reform of the Greek Code of Civil Procedure (hereafter CCP) as well as the Committee that worked on the incorporation of the European Directive in Greece, the interference of judges in mediation as mediators themselves was not initially accepted, because of the fear of excluding the judges in subsequent proceeding. For that reason the Greek Mediation Act did not provide for judicial mediation. However, article 7 of L. 4055/2012 introduced a new institution of extrajudicial settlement of private disputes, the judicial mediation, and finally Article 214B was added to CCP. This new way of solving differences is not growing \"competitively\" but parallel to the other alternatives. This parallel institutionalization of judicial mediation enabled citizens to achievewithout recourse to judicial proceedingsan effective resolution of their differences.",

Zairul Alam, SH.,MH. Selebriti berbeda dengan orang biasa karena informasi yang berkaitan dengan selebriti lebih bernilai ekonomis. Oleh sebab itu, banyak pihak yang berusaha mencari berita mengenai selebriti tanpa mempertimbangkan batasan-batasan privasi yang dimiliki oleh selebriti. Sama dengan orang biasa, selebriti memiliki hak atas privasinya. Setiap orang memilikinya karena hak privasi adalah bagian dari Hak Asasi Manusia yang merupakan hak yang yang melekat pada diri manusia didapatkan secara kodrati sebagai anugerah Tuhan Yang Maha Esa. Namun, belakangan banyak sekali terjadi pelanggaran atas privasi selebriti oleh akun anonim terkait dengan pemberitaan di media sosial. Dalam karya tulis ini membahas mengenai kajian yuridis terhadap pelanggaran hak privasi selebriti atas pemberitaan di media sosial oleh akun anonim berdasarkan Undang-Undang Nomor 19 Tahun 2016 Tentang Perubahan Atas Undang-Undang Nomor 11 Tahun 2008 Tentang Informasi dan Transaksi Elektronik dan Undang-Undang Nomor 40 Tahun 1999 Tentang Pers. Jenis penelitian yang digunakan adalah penelitian yuridis normatif dengan pendekatan perundang-undangan. Kajian yuridis didukung juga dengan bahan hukum sekunder yang terdiri dari penjelasan perundang-undangan, buku maupun jurnal yang berkaitan serta doktrin dari para ahli. Teknik Analisa Hukum dilakukan dengan cara melakukan seleksi bahan hukum, kemudian melakukan klasifikasi dan menyusunnya secara sistematis. Hasil dari penelitian ini adalah bahwa akun anonim sulit untuk dikenakan pasal dalam Undang-Undang ITE maupun Undang-Undang Pers karena akun anonim bukan merupakan subjek hukum meskipun berbuatannya sudah memenuhi pasal dalam kedua undang-undang tersebut.

SJD, M. Zairul Alam, SH., MH. Celebrities are different from ordinary people because information related to celebrities is more economical. Therefore, many parties are trying to find news about celebrities without limits the limits of privacy possessed by celebrities. As with ordinary people, celebrities have the right to privacy. Everyone has it because its right is a right of human rights which is a right which is owned by human being as grace of God Almighty. Nevertheless, to give up a lot of things happen on the privacy of celebrities by anonymous accounts related to social media coverage. In this paper discusses the juridical judgment on celebrity privileges for social media coverage by anonymous accounts under Law Number 19 Year 2016 on Amendment to Law Number 11 Year 2008 on Information and Electronic Transactions and Law Number 40 Year 1999 About Press. The type of research used is normative juridical research with approach of legislation. The juridical study is supported also with secondary legal material consisting of explanations of legislation, books and related journals as well as the doctrines of the experts. The technique of legal analysis is done by selecting legal material, then doing something and arranging it systematically. The result of this study is that anonymous accounts are difficult to subject to in the ITE Act and Press Law because anonymous accounts are not legal subjects whose actions have met the articles of the law.

        "abstract": "ABSTRAK Septian Prawira, 2017 Mahfud, S.H., LLM. Pasal 40 Undang-Undang Nomor 36 Tahun 1999 tentang Telekomunikasi menyebutkan bahwa “Setiap orang dilarang melakukan kegiatan penyadapan atas informasi yang disalurkan melalui jaringan telekomunikasi dalam bentuk apapun”. Akan tetapi, Pasal 12 ayat (1) huruf a Undang-Undang Nomor 30 Tahun 2002 tentang Komisi Pemberantasan Tindak Pidana Korupsi (Undang-Undang KPK) yang memberikan kewenangan kepada KPK untuk melakukan penyadapan dalam melaksanakan tugas penyelidikan, penyidikan, dan penuntutan. Tujuan penelitian ini untuk mengetahui dan menjelaskan kaitan antara penyadapan dalam Undang-Undang KPK dengan hak privasi di Indonesia, dan untuk mengetahui dan menjelaskan kedudukan alat bukti yang diperoleh dari penyadapan dalam teori pembuktian. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian normatif (normative legal research) yang mengkaji asas-asas hukum yang terkandung dalam peraturan perundang-undangan dengan teori-teori dan konsep-konsep yang dikemukakan oleh para ahli melalui buku-buku, jurnal, atau karya ilmiah lainnya, sehingga didapatkan data sekunder untuk selanjutnya dilakukan tindakan analisa. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kaitan antara penyadapan dengan hak privasi di Indonesia terletak dalam beberapa pasal peraturan perundang-undangan yang menyebutkan penyadapan sebagai tindakan yang membatasi hak privasi, seperti Pasal 28G ayat (1) UUD NRI Tahun 1945 . Kedudukan alat bukti yang diperoleh dari penyadapan dalam teori pembuktian yang dianut hukum acara pidana positif (negatief wettelijke) tidak mengakui keabsahan alat bukti yang diperoleh secara tidak sah (unlawful legal evidence). Disarankan kepada KPK dalam melaksanakan tugas penyelidikan, penyidikan, dan penuntutan agar tetap menjamin, melindungi, dan memenuhi HAM seperti hak privasi, demi terwujudnya tujuan hukum. Disarankan untuk mengumpulkan dan menghadirkan alat bukti yang sah dalam proses pembuktian dalam mengungkap kebenaran materiil.",

        "abstract": "The InnoTIP project is a collaboration project between Energy research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN) and LM Wind Power (LM) aimed at reducing Offshore Wind Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE) by improving turbine yield by blade tip geometry. InnoTIP is aimed at developing 3 different tip shapes, which have been manufactured as retrofits to be tested in field on 2.5 MW turbines. During the conceptual phase a number of software tools have been utilized to find optimum for each of the 3 concepts (turbulators, winglet and conventional tip). The quick analysis done by blade element momentum theory (BEM) are initially used where a more refined Lifting Line Method (LLM) is used to have a more accurate understanding of conceptual changes. The final configurations are analysed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) which are far more accurate but also have a large computational cost. A number of parameter variations for each concept have been done to investigate which shape has the most beneficial LCoE decrease (aimed at increase in yield) and the choice of final configuration has been based upon this together with practicalities. Some of the parameters that have been investigated are the twist angle, the sweep angle and the planform shape. Once the conventional tip has been fixed, the winglet has been chosen to be comparable to this. Some off design conditions have been evaluated prior to making the final decision on which tip shape is chosen. Finally, the chosen configurations for winglet and conventional tip have been analysed using CFD analyses. The turbulators geometry has been analysed using LLM as here the wake is of main interest. The chosen concepts are afterwards taken into a detailed design phase where issues regarding e.g. lightning protection, structural strength, attachment, drainage have been solved. During this design period input from a large amount of stakeholders (including the LM Service team) has been used to optimize the methodology. Once the designs were in finalization state, prototypes of the tips were made on full scale and an installation test on a scrapped blade tip have been performed in a controlled environment. This has been done in order to take away any potential issues, as the original blade was not to get damaged. Following the installation test, a structural test for extreme loads have been done to verify the structural strength of the system. Finally the extension was removed and the original blade tip successfully restored. Tests have been performed at the EWTW test site where 5 Nordex N80 2.5MW turbines were available for use. The turbines are assisted with a MetMast which has been used for verification of the weather conditions. The turbulators and conventional tips have been installed and tested mainly by noting the turbine performance change compared to other turbines. In preparation to the field test the turbines have been monitored several weeks to have comparison material to be used during the field test. The test results for the conventional tip show an increase in power at higher wind speeds of more than 4% (the effect of having a longer blade). The actual increase due to geometry change is in the order of 2% to 9% for wind speeds above 8 m/s. Data for the wake influenced turbine did not show an actual increase in power mainly due to lack of measurement time where the turbine has been in the wake. The turbulators themselves do increase the power on the retrofitted turbine itself. Here the increase in power is in the order of 2% to 10% for wind speeds above 8 m/s. A wind farm simulation performed for the Hyller project shows the effect of scaling the new tip shapes to a larger rotor diameter with its effect on wind farm yield. A simulated wind farm shows the effect of distance between turbines with respect to turbine diameter. Looking at a standalone machine the scaled up version (to 5 MW platform) of the conventional tip is calculated to have an AEP increase of about 3%. The results are presuming the solution is a retrofit, however the actual benefits will likely be higher when the solution is integrated in the design such that no interference effects are present as well as the possibility for a better optimization for the complete blade. The LCoE is the fraction of the total cost over the lifetime versus the electricity produced over the lifetime. Looking at literature references, it can be found that turbine cost are counting for approximately 25% of the total cost and 22% of those cost are due to the blades. This results in a fraction of 5.5% of blade cost compared to the overall energy cost. The conventional tip is not expected to have a large increase in cost as its a relative small change to the current practice. However, even a 1% increase in blade cost, would be negligible compared to a yield increase of 3%. As such all three options are good for implementation and reducing LCoE.",

Pada akhirnya aplikasi disalahgunakan oleh pihak lain, dimana pengguna melakukan tindakan penyiaran langsung karya sinematografi milik orang lain tanpa izin yang menyebabkan kerugian bagi orang lain. Hal ini dapat dilihat sebagai tindakan illegal karena para penyiar bisa saja menyiarkan karya sinematografi milik orang lain yang direkam secara langsung dari bioskop (real streaming) , dimana sudah jelas hal ini adalah tindakan melawan hukum dan merugikan pihak lain. Orang-orang yang seharusnya menonton di bioskop menjadi dapat menonton melalui orang yang tindakan penyiaran melalui media internet maupun media sosial ini.

Zairul Alam SH., MH. Law Faculty, Brawijaya University indahmilana@gmail.com Copyright protection on cinematography in fact can be considered did not going well. The problem started from the development of technology in the cyber world which now provides application where users can do real streaming with easy, free, and not wearing any terms, for example through a personal blog or social media as Bigolive. Period of broadcasting is not restricted, so that users can freely displaying everything from the start until end. The application was ultimately abused by the other party, where users perform actions rebroadcast cinematographic which belonging to another person without permission. This can be seen as an act of illegal because the broadcaster may broadcast the work of cinematography like movies in the cinema where it's obvious this is the action against the law and detrimental to the other party. The people who are supposed to be watching at the cinema, be able to watch through the broadcasting over internet, as well as social media. Once the real streaming broadcast is done will be automatically deleted after the broadcast has finished running. This complicates the monitoring and provide a great opportunity for offenders to get away from Government oversight over illegal actions they do. The existence of these problems then can give rise to various problems which may cause harm to the creator or copyright holders of cinematography. Therefore, researchers want to examine how the protection of copyright on works of cinematography through internet media or social media based on Act Number 28 Year 2014 about Copyright and Act number 11 Year 2008 about Information and Electronic Transactions.

In its decision, the Constitutional Court stated that phrase \"since the marriage was took place\" in Article 29 chapter (3), and phrase \"as long as the marriage lasts\" in Article 29 chapter (4) had limited two individuals to do or when to do a agreement, so contradictory to Article 28E chapter (2) on the Constitution of NRI In 1945 conditionally as long as it means including during the bond of marriage. It means that the interpretation of the Constitutional Court against Article 29, Marriage Law allows the making of prenuptial agreement after the marriage took place or during bond of marriage taking place \"at the time; before marriage took place or during the bond of marriage\". . This is evidenced by the State Court Decision 459 / Pdt / P / 2007PN.Jkt.Tmr.

UB Faculty of Law devilzeight@gmail.com Abstract Rapid technological developments lead to new criminal offenses. One of which is internet piracy of songs, films, papers, etc. The research problems raised are what forms of legal protection should be granted by the state in regard with cinematographic piracy offenses via the Internet, as well as whether the offender can be convicted of cinematographypiracy. The state has provided protection through Act no. 28 year 2014 on copyright, namely in article 9, paragraph (1) of the exclusive right of the creator to his creation, and article 40 paragraph (1) of the forms of creation that is protected by Indonesia, Article 113 paragraph (3) regarding sanctions for perpetrators of criminal acts of piracy; Act no.11 of 2008 onelectronic information and transactions, namely article 27 paragraph (1) concerning distribution of electronic documents  which violate decency. Based on the explanation of forms of legal protection provided by the State, the crime ofmovie piracy can be imprisoned for Article 9, paragraph (1) point b stating that the doubling of creation in any form . It means that it already covers over the internet as well and in article 113 paragraph (3 ) on sanctions for perpetrators of piracy. It can be concluded that the country has provided  copyright protection against cinematography piracy offenses through law no.28 year 2014 on copyright as well as the Law no. 11 of 2008 on electronic information and transactions. I believe that the protection provided by the government of Indonesia is still considered lacking due to the determination of the perpetrators of piracy cinematography through an online site that is still hard to implement becausethere is not any relevant legislation making any mention about it clearly.

Judul tersebut dilatar belakangi oleh permasalahan hukum terhadap maraknya tindak pidana balap liar yang terjadi di Kabupaten Sidoarjo terhadap pelanggaran Pasal 115 huruf b Undang-Undang Nomor 22 Tahun 2009 tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan. Berdasarkan hal tersebut diatas, karya tulis ini mengangkat rumusan masalah: (1) Apakah yang menjadi alasan pelaku melakukan tindak pidana balap liar di Kabupaten Sidoarjo?(2) Apakah yang menjadi alasan pihak kepolisian tidak melakukan penyidikan terhadap tindak pidana balap liar di Kabupaten Sidoarjo?. Kemudian penulisan karya tulis ini menggunakan metode yuridis empiris dengan metode pendekatan Teknik Yuridis Sosiologis. Bahan hukum primer, sekunder, dan tersier yang diperoleh penulis akan dianalisis menggunakan teknik analisis deduktif, yakni mencari solusi sebagai kesimpulan terkait dengan alasan pelaku melakukan tindak pidana balap liar. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian dengan metode di atas, penulis memperoleh atas jawaban permasalahan yang ada bahwa Alasan Pelaku Melakukan Tindak Pidana Balap Liar Di Kabupaten Sidoarjo (a). Pelaku Kurang Memahami Terhadap Larangan Balap Liar Dalam Undang-Undang Tentang Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan; (b). Pelaku Ingin Mendapatkan Pujian Dari Orang Lain; (c). Tidak Adanya Tempat Untuk Menyalurkan Bakat Balap; (d). Pelaku Ingin Mendapatkan Pengakuan Yang Lebih Dari Orang Lain; (e). Sebagai Tempat Untuk Mencari Uang; dan (f). Kurangnya Pengawasan Dari Orang TuaPelaku. Selanjutnya Alasan Pihak Kepolisian Tidak Melakukan Penyidikan Terhadap Balap Liar Di Kabupaten Sidoarjo yaitu dengan alas an tindak pidana balap liar merupakan jenis penanganan pidana ringan dan tindak pidana balap liar haruslah menggunakan asas peradilan cepat dan ringan, hal ini dikecualikan apabila terdapat perjudian atau luka-luka atau kematian akibat dari balap liar tersebut bagi pengguna jalan atau kendaraan lain yang melintas di lintasan balap liar tersebut. Pada bagian kesimpulan, penulis menyarankan bahwa Agar masyarkat yakni pelaku tindak pidana balap liar diberikan wadah untuk melakukan aksi balap tesebutdi Kabupaten Sidoarjo dengan biaya yang terjangkau; Perlunya peran orang tua untuk mengawasi anak dalam mencegah maraknya tindak pidana balap liar; dan Sebagai aparat penegak hokum sebaiknya memberikan sosialisasi terhadap masyarakat khususnya pelaku tindak pidana balap liar terkait dengan bahaya balap liar.

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email: 135010100111137@mail.ub.ac.id Abstrak Eksplorasi dan eksploitasi yang dilakukan di ruang angkasa merupakan salah satu bukti nyata bahwa teknologi semakin berkembang dari masa ke masa. Ruang angkasa merupakan wilayah yang tidak dapat diklaim sebagai milik suatu negara saja, akan tetapi seluruh negara yang berpartisipasi dalam kegiatan keruang angkasaan wajib untuk menjaga keamanan dan ketertiban di ruang angkasa. Setiap kegiatan yang dilakukan di ruang angkasa harus mempunyai tujuan damai. Akibat dari semakin meningkatnya kegiatan Negara-negara yang melibatkan ruang angkasa ini menyebabkan timbulnya masalah-masalah hukum. Banyaknya satelit buatan manusia di ruang angkasa yang telah habis masa pakainya, menjadi penyebab terjadinya kecelakaan atau tabrakan antara satu objek dengan lainnya. Seusai yang diatur dalam perjanjian-perjanjian internasional, yang berkaitan tentang kegiatan ruang angkasa beserta tanggung jawabnya dan seluruh Negara peluncur harus bertanggungjawab jika satelit miliknya yang telah habis masa pakai mengakibatkan kerugian bagi Negara lain baik itu secara langsung maupun tidak. Negara yang hendak melakukan kegiatan ruang angkasa harus tunduk pada regulasi-regulasi internasional. Dalam kegiatan ruang angkasa yang mengakibatkan kerusakan atau kerugian diperlukan suatu regulasi internasional yang mengatur lebih rinci mengenai pertanggungjawaban suatu Negara apabila masa pakai satelitnya telah habis dan meminimalisir kemungkinan terjadinya kecelakaan di ruang angkasa. Bagi Negara yang mengalami kerugian dapat menuntut ganti rugi melalui saluran diplomatiknya. Terdapat juga ketentuan-ketentuan mengenai prosedur penuntutan ganti rugi di dalam regulasi-regulasi internasional. Selain itu, dapat ditempuh juga alternatif penyelesaian sengketa yang diatur di hukum internasional. Hal ini disebabkan karena hukum ruang angkasa merupakan bagian dari hukum internasional, selain itu Negara yang melakukan kegiatan ruang angkasa atau yang disebut sebagai Negara peluncur juga merupakan salah subjek dari hukum internasional.

Faculty of Law Universitas Brawijaya Email: 135010100111137@mail.ub.ac.id Abstrak Exploration and exploitation in space is a proof that the technology is growing from time to time. Aerospace is a region that cannot be claimed as the property of one country alone. Instead, all the countries that participate in the space activities are obliged to maintain security and order in space. Any activities undertaken in space must have peaceful purposes. As a result of the increasing activities of States involving space is the emergence of legal problems. Many man-made satellites in space that have expired cause accident or collision between one object to another. As stipulated in international agreements, all space activities and the responsibilities that follow and all the launcher states should be held responsible if their expired satellites cause the loss of other states, directly or indirectly. Countries that want to conduct space activities should be subject to international regulations. In outer space activities that result in damage or loss, an international regulation is required to regulate the details about the responsibility of a State due to its expired satellites and to minimize the possibility of space accidents. A sate that experienced a loss can claim compensation through diplomatic channels. There are also provisions on redress procedures within international regulations. Besides, alternative way of resolution over disputes can be pursued as regulated in International law. This is because space law is part of international law. In addition, the State conducting outer space or the so-called State launcher is also a subject of international law. Keywords: Life span, State Launcher, State Responsibility, Space, Satellite.",

Jenis penelitian yang dilakukan penulis adalah penelitian hukum normatif, maka penulis menggunakan pendekatan penelitian untuk menganalisis permasalahan-permasalahan yang hendak dikaji, yaitu Pendekatan Perundang-Undangan. Dari hasil penelitian dengan metode di atas, penulis memperoleh jawaban atas permasalahan yang ada bahwa kekuatan eksekutorial sertifikat jaminan fidusia dalam Pasal 15 ayat (2) Undang-Undang Jaminan Fidusia mengakibatkan tidak terpenuhinya hak konsumen dalam Pasal 4 huruf e Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen. Adapun penyelesaian konflik hukum antara 2 undang-undang tersebut dapat diselesaikan menggunakan asas Lex Specialis Derogat Legi Generalis . Dimana Undang-Undang Jaminan Fidusia berlaku sebagai Lex Specialis yang mengesampingkan Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen sebagai Lex Generalis . Dengan begitu, penulis menyarankan agar pemerintah seharusnya dapat mengkonsistenkan Undang-Undang tentang Jaminan Fidusia yang melindungi kepentingan pelaku usaha. Serta hakim juga  seharusnya dapat lebih konsisten dalam menjatuhkan putusan dengan mempertimbangkan kekuatan eksekutorial sertifikat jaminan fidusia yang dimiliki pelaku usaha dengan hak yang dimiliki oleh konsumen untuk mendapatkan advokasi, perlindungan, dan upaya penyelesaian sengketa konsumen. ABSTRACT In this final thesis, the researcher discusses about the power of eksekutorial in fiducia warranty certificate related to the consumers’ right to get the advocacy, protection, and the effort to accomplish the consumers’ protection of dispute properly. The background of this topic is the existence of laws conflict that happened between Pasal 15 ayat 2 Undang-Undang about Jaminan Fidusia and Pasal 4 Huruf e Undang-Undang about Perlindungan Konsumen. Based on this topic, this final thesis lift problem of the studies as follows : (1) Is the Power of ‘Eksekutorial’ in Fiducia Warranty Certificate Related to the Consumers’ Right to Get the Advocacy, Protection, and The Effort to Accomplish the Consumers’ Protection of Dispute Properly can be fulfilled? And (2) What is the basic of judge’s verdict consideration in Putusan Mahkamah Agung Republik Indonesia Nomor 350 K/Pdt.Sus-BPSK/2016 and Nomor 55/Pdt.Sus-BPSK/2015/PN.Pdg. based on the law of fiducia warranty and the law of consumer’s protection. The type of this research done by the researcher is normative law research, so the researcher uses Perundang-Undangan approach to analyze the problems that will be discussed. Based on the result with this method above, the researcher gets the answer of the problems that the power of ‘eksekutorial’ in fiducia warranty certificate in the Pasal 15 ayat (2) Undang Undang Jaminan Fidusia results the unfulfilled of consumers’ right in the Pasal 4 huruf e Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen. As for the solution of the laws conflict between thsose 2 undang-undang is by using Lex Specialis Derogat Legi Generalis principle. Where the Undang-Undang Jaminan Fidusia occurs as Lex Specialis which sets aside the Undang-Undang Perlindungan Konsumen as Lex Generalis . Therefore, the researcher suggests that the government should make consistency in Undang-Undang about Jaminan Fidusia which protects the interest of business actors. Also, the judge should be more consistent in giving the verdict by considering the power of ‘eksekutorial’ in fiducia warranty owned by business actors with the right owned by the consumers to get the advocacy, protection, and the effort to accomplish the consumers’ dispute.",

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email: Adhiragad@gmail.com ABSTRAK Mediasi merupakan suatu penyelesaian sengketa di luar jalur persidangan yang membutuhkan peran serta pihak ketiga dalam hal ini mediator yang berfungsi sebagai pihak netral guna menyelesaikan sengketa. Menurut ketentuan Pasal 130 HIR, seorang hakim wajib untuk mengupayakan perdamaian (mediasi) pada awal persidangan. Tentu makna dari ketentuan tersebut memberikan syarat bahwa sebelum proses litigasi perkara perdata dimulai, maka diwajibkan untuk mendamaikan para pihak lewat jalur mediasi. Prinsip utama pelaksanaan mediasi ada pada iktikad baik para pihak untuk menyelesaikan sengketa secara damai. Harus diperhatikan bahwa kedudukan mediator bukan sebagai pemutus perkara kedua belah pihak melainkan sebagai pihak yang netral guna memfasilitasi jalannya mediasi tersebut. Sifat dan hakekat perkara dalam mediasi ada pada para pihak, Apabila hasil dari mediasi menyatakan bahwa telah disepakati beberapa klausula perdamaian diantara para pihak, maka mediator akan melaporkan hasil kerjanya kepada majelis hakim yang kemudian dibuatkan akta perdamaian yang mempunyai kekuatan seperti putusan yang telah memperoleh kekuatan hukum tetap.

Indonesia merupakan salah satu negara yang pernah mengalami peristiwa suksesi negara ketika Timor Leste memutuskan untuk memisahkan diri pada tahun 2002. Hukum internasional memberi petunjuk mengenai akibat hukum terhadap perjanjian internasional lewat Konvensi Wina 1978. Dalam kasus Indonesia-Timor Leste terdapat dua perjanjian yang beralih ke Timor Leste yakni perjanjian batas wilayah Timor Gap dan perjanjian hutang Indonesia-Amerika Serikat. Namun konsekuensi hukum kedua perjanjian tersebut berbeda meskipun keduanya beralih ke Timor Leste. Suksesi negara juga dikenal menimbulkan dua subjek dalam peristiwanya yakni predecessor state dan successor state. Namun berdasarkan definisi secara umum serta beberapa kasus mengenai negara melakukan suksesi negara, successor state diartikan sebagai negara yang mewarisi hak dan kewajiban dari predecessor state secara penuh dan hal tersebut tidak terjadi kepada Timor Leste.

Indonesia is one of state that once had experienced state succession when Timor Leste decided to separate themselves from Indonesia in 2002. The international law has given the guidance about the legal consequences toward international agreement through Vienna Convention 1978. This convention contains the guidance about which agreements that can be changed over. In the case of state succession between Indonesia-Timor Leste, there were two agreements that changed over Timor Leste which is Timor Gap Treaty and Loan Agreements between Indonesia-USA. But the legal consequences between those agreements is different although they both changed over Timor Leste. Beside causing several legal consequences, state succession also causes two new subjects which are predecessor state and successor state. But based on general definition and based on several cases about state succession, successor state is defined as state that fully responsible for rights and obligations from predecessor state and Timor Leste is clearly not defined as that. This is a normative juridical research which aim is giving the clear answer about the use of the word successor state for Timor Leste and giving clear analyst about the difference of legal consequences between two Indonesia international agreements that changed over Timor Leste.

Hal tersebut dilatar belakangi oleh banyaknya kasus pelanggaran merek terkenal dimana banyak sekali merek lokal yang menggunakan nama merek terkenal asing untuk mempromosikan barang dan/atau jasa yang dimilikinya. Namun yang terjadi, banyak sekali dari sekian banyak kasus pelanggaran merek tersebut yang putusannya tidak sesuai dengan penerapan prinsip perlindungan merek terkenal yang diberikan oleh Undang-Undang Merek di Indonesia karena terdapat beberapa kelemahan-kelemahan yang muncul baik dalam Undang-Undang Merek 2001 dan Undang-Undang Merek 2016. Konvensi Internasional TRIPs juga mengatakan bahwa sampai pada saat ini belum ada satu negarapun yang bisa memberikan definisi tentang merek terkenal.Penelitian ini menggunakan penelitian yuridis normatif. Dalam penelitian ini ditemukan beberapa kelemahan dalam Undang-Undang Merek di Indonesia antara lain tidak adanya pengertian merek terkenal, kedua tidak adanya pengertian tentang teori reputasi, ketiga tidak dicantumkan syarat-syarat suatu merek dapat ditolak. Sampai pada saat ini Pemerintah Republik Indonesia belum mempunyai upaya untuk permasalahan ini. Rekomendasi atau saran untuk pemerintah dan pengadilan yang berwenang: a) memperbaiki kelemahan-kelemahan dalam undang-undang merek, b) mengetahui ciri-ciri dari merek terkenal, c) mengetahui reputasi merek terkenal di masyarakat. Kata kunci: Prinsip Perlindungan Merek Terkenal , Bossini , Curesonic , Undang-Undang Merek , TRIPs ABSTRACT This study discussed the issue on the implementation of the principle of protection for famous brand in the case of Bossini and Curesonic by studying the decree by Supreme Court number No 211 K/Pdt.Sus-HKI/2015 and the decree of Supreme Court No 462 K/Pdt.Sus-HKI/2015. This was triggered by the fact that there were many cases of violation on famous brand in which many local brands used famous freign brands to promote their goods/ services. Many of the court decisions were not in accordance with the implementation of principle of famous brand protection regulated under Law of Brand in Indonesia due to some weakneses of Law of Brand year 2001 and Law of Brand year 2016. International convention of TRIP also states that until now there has not been any country which can define the definition of famous brand. This study used normative juridical design. This study revealed some weaknesses in the Law of Brand in Indonesia. The weaknesses are the absence of definition on famous brand, the absence of definition on the theory of reputation, and the absence of requirement for a brand to be rejected. Up to now, the government of the Republic of Indonesia has not done any effort to solve this issue. Thus, the recomendations and suggestions given for the government and the authorizing court are: a) fix the weaknesses found in the law of brand, b) define the characteristics of famous brand, c) define the reputation of famous brand in society.

        "abstract": "Understanding the structural, geometrical and chemical changes that occur after electronic excitation is essential to unraveling the inherent physical and chemical mechanisms of nitro explosives. In this work, the relaxed structure of some typical nitro explosives in the excited state, including RDX, HMX, CL-20, PETN and LLM-105, have been investigated by timedependent density functional theory. During the excitation process, an electron is vertically excited into a low-lying excited state, imparting π-antibonding character onto the nitro group. The nitro group becomes activated by the excitation energy and then relaxes via vibrational cooling, leading to a relaxed excited-state structure. All five nitro explosives exhibit similar behavior in which impact sensitivity is related to the excitation energy of the relaxed structure. Insight into the relaxed structure of typical nitro explosives offers an efficient method of unraveling ultrafast and complex photo-initiated reactions and detonation physics.",

MDS değişen oranlarda, Dünya Sağlık Örgütü (DSÖ)’ne göre kemik iliği (Kİ) veya periferik kanda ≥ %20 blast varlığı ile tanısı konulan akut miyeloid lösemi (AML)’ye ilerleme riski içerir (1). Hastalık, DSÖ 2008 MDS sınıflandırma kriterleri ve MDS/ MPN sınıflandırmasına göre alt gruplara ayrılmıştır (2). MDS alt gruplarından olan refrakter anemi (MDS-RA) ve refrakter anemi ring sideroblast ile beraber (RARS); düşük grade MDS olarak kabul edilmekte olup, uzun sağkalımla birliktelik gösterir. Blast artışı ile prezente olan RAEB grubu ve kronik miyelomonositik lösemi (KMML) ile overlap olan MDS ise yüksek grade hastalık ve kısa süreli sağkalımla ilişkili bulunmuştur (3). MDS’de kullanılan ilaç tedavileri küratif olmayıp, hem MDS hem de KMML için bilinen tek küratif tedavi seçeneği uyumlu vericiden yapılan allojenik kök hücre naklidir (AKHN) (4,5). Tedavide hipometile edici ilaçlar özellikle yüksek risk grubunda sıklıkla kullanılmaktadır. Hipometile edici özelliğe sahip ilaçlardan azasitidin her risk grubunda önerilirken, desitabin daha çok orta ve yüksek risk grubunda önerilmektedir (3). DNA metilasyonu epigenetik mekanizmalardan birisi olup, yeni sentezlenen DNA’da post-replikatif dönemde DNA metiltransferaz (DNMT) enzimi ile oluşur. Metilasyon sonucunda, başta p53 olmak üzere tümör süpresör genler inaktive olur ve onkogenez süreci başlar. Nükleozid analogları olan azasitidin ve desitabin DNMT enzimini inhibe ederek etki gösterir. Desitabin direkt DNA’ya bağlanarak inhibisyon yaparken, azasitidin DNA ve sıklıkla RNA’ya bağlanarak RNA ve protein sentezini önler (3). Bu çalışmada, MDS hastalarında tüm dünyada yaygın olarak kullanılan hipometile edici özelliği olan azasitidin ve desitabinin MDS tedavisindeki etkinlikleri ve sağkalım süresine olan etkileri retrospektif veriler kullanılarak araştırılmıştır.",

Sehingga dapat menemukan hasil pihak manakah yang tepat menurut legitimasi hukum. Dalam perolehan wilayah yang sedang dalam keadaan sengketa banyak sekali upaya yang tidak berdasarkan kaidah hukum internasional dilakukan untuk menjadikan wilayah sengketa sebagai miliknya. Dan penyelesaian sengketa tersebut tergolong sulit untuk dicari titik temunya. Seperti salah satu contoh kasus sengketa pulau dokdo antara Korea dan Jepang yang belum terselesaikan hingga saat ini. Terdapat klaim dari kedua negara, namun klaim yang diajukan tidak seluruhnya memiliki legitimasi hukum. Korea Selatan mengklaim bahwa pulau Dokdo adalah wilayah kedaulatannya dari masa dinasti Shilla 512 SM, bahkan banyak dokumen sejarah pada masa kekaisaran Korea Selatan yang membuktikan legalisasi pulau Dokdo oleh kaisar Jepang bahwa pulau Dokdo adalah wilayah kedaulatan Korea Selatan. Sedangkan Jepang mengklaim bahwa pulau Takeshima adalah wilayah kedaulatannya berdasarkan perjanjian San Fransisco 1951 pasal 2 yang menyebutkan bahwa Jepang hanya melepaskan kedaulatannya atas pulau Dagelet, Quelpart, dan Port Hamilton. Sehingga dengan pernyataan tersebut Jepang merasa sama sekali tidak melepaskan kedaulatannya atas pulau Takeshima, bahkan hal tersebut diperkuat dengan adanya putusan perfektur Shimane No.40 yang membuktikan secara legitimasi hukum bahwa pulau Takeshima adalah wilayah kedaulatan Jepang yang diperoleh dengan cara aneksasi. Berdasarkan realita Jepang mengajak Korea Selatan mengajukan sengketa ini ke mahkamah internasional, namun Korea Selatan tidak setuju dengan pendapat Jepang. Maka dari itu tanpa adanya upaya penyelesaian sengketa lebih lanjut, membuat sengketa ini berlangsung panjang.

South Korea claims that Dokdo is its territory from the Shilla Dynasty period 512 BC, even during the many historical documents that prove imperial South Korea legalization Dokdo by the emperor of Japan that Dokdo is South Korea's sovereign territory. While Japan claims that Takeshima islands are its territory under the agreement of San Francisco in 1951 Article 2, which states that Japan only release its sovereignty over the island Dagelet, Quelpart, and Port Hamilton. So with the statement of Japan feel totally relinquish its sovereignty over Takeshima island, even it is reinforced by the decision of Shimane prefecture 40 which proves the legitimacy of the law that the island of Takeshima is Japanese sovereign territory obtained by annexation.

Pemilihan tema dalam penelitian ini dilatar belakangi oleh kekaburan pasal 28 Undang – Undang Nomor 39 Tahun 2004 Tentang Penempatan dan Perlindungan TKI di Luar Negeri (UU PPTIKLN). Pada pasal 28 UU PPTKILN tersebut  tidak menjelaskan apa yang dimaksud dengan pekerjaan dan jabatan tertentu. Pada penjelasan pasal 28 UU PPTKILN hanya memuat satu pekerjaan yaitu pekerjaan “diantaranya” sebagai pelaut, pekerjaan dan jabatan lainnya tidak dijelaskan. Sehingga menimbulkan pertanyaan bagaimna wujud perlindungan terhadap pekerjaan dan jabatan tertentu. Penelitian ini menggunakan jenis penelitian yuridis normatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan perundang undangan dan pendekatan konseptual. Bahan hukum yang digunakan pada penelitian ini dilakukan meleluai interpretasi yakni interpretasi gramatikal dan interpretasi sistematis. Berdasarkan hasil pembahasan, diperoleh hasil bahwa Wujud perlindungan pekerjaan sebagai pelaut dapat di lihat di Peraturan kepala BNP2TKI Nomor PER.3/KA/I/2013 Tentang Tata cara penempatan dan perlindungan TKI pelaut perikanan di kapal berbendera asing dan Peraturan kepala BNP2TKI Nomor 12/KA/IV/2013 tentang tata cara perekrutan penempatan dan perlindungan pelaut di kapal berbendera asing serta perlindungan  hukum TKI yang bekerja sebagai pekerja rumah tangga terdapat dalam pasal 77 – pasal 84 UU PPTKILN.

This study was conducted because of the vagueness of Law number 39 year 2004 on the placement and protection of Indonesian’s migrant workers. Article 28 of Law on the definition of certain job and position. The explanation of article 28 0f Law on the placement and protection of indonesian’s migrant workers only mentions one job which is sailor. Other jobs and positions are not mentioned. Thus, a question has been raised on the form of protection for the certain job and position. This study employed normative juridical method with statute and conceptual approaches. This study employed grammatical and systematic interpretations. The results of the study show that the form of protection for sailors can be seen in the regulation for Indonesian Overseas Workers working as fishermen in foreign-flagged ship and the regulation of head of National Authority for the Placement and Protection of Indonesian Overseas Workers number 12/KA/IV/2013 about the recruitement procedures, placement and protection of fishermen working n foreign-flagged ships and also the legal protection for Indonesian Workers working as housemaid that is contained in article 77 until 84 of Law on Law on the placement and protection of Indonesian’s overseas workers.

Agis Ardiansyah, SH, LLM Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email : adndaps@gmail.com Abstraksi Konvensi Wina 1963 tentang Hubungan Konsuler telah menjelaskan bahwa pejabat konsuler memiliki hak kekebalan dan keistimewaan yang dimulai ketika mereka di berikan surat kepercayaan dari Negara pengirim ke Negara penerima dan di setujui oleh Negara penerima. Hak kekebalan dan keistimewaan juga di berikan kepada keluarga yang tinggal satu rumah dengan pejabat konsuler tetapi tidak semua hak kekebalan yang dimiliki pejabat konsuler sama dengan yang di berikan kepada keluarga. Namun, ditemukan masalah berkaitan dengan pasangan sesama jenis dari pejabat konsuler yang di rasa tidak sesuai dengan Hukum Nasional Indonesia. Faktanya Indonesia tidak melegalkan perkawinan sesama jenis. Hal ini terjadi karena tidak adanya batasan keluarga bagi pejabat konsuler. Dalam penelitian ini, penulis memilih metode yuridis normatif dengan tujuan untuk memberikan batasan dari keluarga pejabat konsuler, sehingga dapat menemukan solusi berkaitan dengan pengakuan Indonesia terhadap pemberian hak kekebalan dan keistimewaan terhadap pasangan sesama jenis bagi pejabat konsuler .

However, there was a problem about equal marriage types from the consular that make a sense incompatible with National law and regulations of Indonesia. The fact is Indonesian did not legalized equal marriage types. This occurs due to the absence of member of the family limitation for consular. In this work, the author choose the juridical normative reseacrch methods with the aim to provide constraint of the member of the family, so it can be find solution with regard to the recognition of Indonesia to give the privileges and immunities to equal marriage types for the consular minister.

Program Studi Strata Satu Ilmu Hukum Fakultas Hukum Universtias Brawijaya Shabrina.januarissa@gmail.com Dark pool merupakan sistem perdagangan alternatif yang dilakukan broker-dealer tanpa adanya keterbukaan. Pada prinsip nya dark pool tidak sesuai dengan ketentuan hukum pasar modal Indonesia, karena pasar  modal Indonesia menganut prinsip keterbukaan. Dengan demikian maka tidak adanya landasan yang dapat diambil oleh investor untuk menanamkan dananya dalam setiap kegiatan pasar modal, hal ini juga memicu timbulnya manipulasi harga. Tujuan dalam penelitian ini adalah untuk menganalis bentuk perlindungan hukum yang diberikan OJK bagi investor dalam melakukan transaksi dark pool . Jenis penelitian ini adalah yuridis normatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan perundang-undangan dan pendekatan perbandingan. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa belum ada ketentuan hukum mengenai dark pool di Indonesia. Peraturan Bapepam hanya mengatur transaksi diluar bursa. Namun terdapat beberapa peraturan OJK yang dapat memberikan perlindungan hukum bagi investor terkait transaksi ini yaitu peraturan OJK tentang keterbukaan oleh emiten atau perusahaan publik dan peraturan tentang perizinan perusahaan efek sebagai perantara pedagang efek.

Zairul Alam, SH., MH. Program Studi Strata Satu Ilmu Hukum Faculty of Law Brawijaya University Shabrina.januarissa@gmail.com Dark pool is an alternative trading systems that done by broker-dealer without openness. The principle of dark pool itself is not in accordance with the legal provisions of Indonesian capital market, because the Indonesian capital market adheres to the principle of openness. Thus, the absence of a foundation that can be taken by investors to invest their funds in any capital market activities, it also lead to price manipulation. The purpose of this research is to analyze the forms of legal protection granted by FSA for investors in the transaction dark pool. Type of research used is juridical normative using statute approach and comparative approach. Based on the research we concluded that there are no legal provisions regarding dark pool in Indonesia. Bapepam regulations only govern transactions outside the exchange. But there are some provisions  there are some provisions that can provide legal protection for investors related to the disclosure of information made by public companies and regulations on the licensing company's securities brokerage.

        "abstract": "Kristiyanto, Dhiana Puspitawati, SH., LLM., PhD, Agis Ardhiansyah, SH., LLM Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email: kristiyanto1994@gmail.com AbstractI The purpose of this research is to understand China’s historic claim, the status and the purpose of the so-called nine-dashed line map over the islands and maritime areas of the South China Sea and the legal implications for dispute settlement mechanism between ASEAN and China which currently in tough progress. It’s clear that by virtue of International Law of The Sea (UNCLOS), China’s historic claim over maritime areas (water column, seabed and subsoil, low tide elevations and submerged features), such right is not recognized. While the legal basis of China’s claim is unquestionable, the preliminary findings that led to the hypothesis of this research suggest that China’s historic claim was derived from the concept of historic waters as well as historic title that gives the birth towards the traditional fishing ground alluded on the Article 15 UNCLOS, supported by China’s self-proclaimed occupation of much of the areas of South China Sea for more than 2000 years. This research would also examine the element of “history” as the basis of their claim, China’s historic claim comprise of two broad aspect: a historic basis of sovereignty and a historic claim over maritime areas in the South China Sea. China has asserted that they will not participate on the proceedings and neither obey the final decision of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, however such actions is not a bar for the proceedings. On the other hand, the talk between ASEAN and China over the dispute started in 1994 but give no clear direction upon the binding-agreement of the Code of Conduct (COC) between two parties. The willingness of the parties to bind themselves emerged on the 2002 Declaration of Conduct, but the slow progress has worsen the situation and many unanswered problems still remained, hence, this research would also examined the dispute settlement mechanism of the two parties by focusing the discussion on the internal problems within ASEAN. The method used on this research is juridical normative combined with statute approach and conceptual approach. The research will then deeply analyze the relevant document as the primary legal material such as the Tribunal verdict of PCA Case Number 2013-19 Arbitration between China and the Phillipines, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), ASEAN Charter, Declaration of Conduct 2002. The secondary legal material includes Journal from legal scholars, relevant and credible sources from the internet as well as other relevant documents. The research concluded that the term and the usage of historic rights could not be partially applied to specific things, but shall cover the entire sovereignty of their claimed-area comprehensively. In regards to ASEAN, the research showed that there is an internal issue of disunity and distrust among ASEAN member states, it is stipulated by the decisions of the Phillipines of bringing the case before the PCA without prior negotiation as what agreed on the consensus principle of the member states.

        "title": "Risk Regulation: Hic et Ubique",
        "abstract": "My first encounter with risk regulation occurred through my LLM and PhD research at NYU School of Law. I had had an interest in the balancing of trade liberalization and social regulatory objectives already during my undergraduate studies at the LSE where I had the privilege of studying European Union law with Damian Chalmers. During my LLM, I wrote a term paper on the WTO Appellate Body’s EC-Hormones decision. This dispute was the first to be adjudicated under the WTO’s Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures by a young Appellate Body. The SPS Agreement requires WTO members which do not use international standards for their domestic regulation to justify their higher levels of protection with scientific evidence. I quickly realised that the decision raised important questions about the extent to which law or judges can set sensible threshold levels of scientific proof and that the decision how stringently to regulate inevitably requires political judgment that is difficult to review judicially. As I had been engrossed by the report and relevant literature, I decided to make the regulation of risk through the WTO’s Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement the topic of my PhD. At the suggestion of my then supervisor Philippe Sands, I refined my research topic to focus on the regulation of agricultural biotechnology through WTO law. This subject not only raised the above questions in a general manner but also a set of unique questions about the proper method to assess the risks of genetically modified organisms (GMO), a question of consumer sovereignty to choose GM-free products despite potential benefits of GMOs, including for developing countries, and the question whether the irreversibility of release into the environment of GMOs calls for special precautions. I understood that the production of epistemologically valid scientific evidence requires a certain detachment from real world conditions, which limits its analytical usefulness for real world problems. Science is also fallible and what scientific evidence is produced hinges on framings, conventions and financial rewards for research. As a result of its necessary inferences, potential for error and social bias, I argued epistemological standards can only ever provide a partial justification for regulatory action and need supplementary justification on the basis of genuine normative argument about what is reciprocally acceptable.",

        "abstract": "This research investigates the beliefs of LLM students about their role and responsibility, as well asthe role and responsibility of their teachers, in the process of learning the French language. The main objective was to identify and define those beliefs, since responsibility and role are two fundamental principles in this learning process. According to Argyris and Schon (quoted in Zhong, 2010), human beings act according to their own beliefs and therefore autonomous learning is also ruled by these. In that sense, Cotterall and Hortwitz (quoted in Kehrwald, 2005) add that erroneous beliefs lead to less effective strategies for learning. The theoretical basis that guided the research includes the concepts of autonomy, role, responsibility and beliefs in autonomous learning. The beliefs were collected through a questionnaire made up of open questions and three Likert scales, followed by a semi-structured interview to deepen some aspects of our research. The results also show that the majority of students attribute to the teacher, to a large extent, the technical aspects of their learning, such as the identification of learning objectives and purposes, the selection of topics, learning activities and resources. Another large part of the students accepts to some extent the responsibility to reflect and evaluate their learning and accept, to a large extent, the responsibility to maintain their interest and motivation in the learning.",

        "abstract": "This LLM dissertation focuses on proposed Amendment 167 of the Criminal Finances Act 2017, by which Bermuda (and other British Overseas Territories) would be forced to adopt public registers of beneficial ownership. This paper assesses the potential legal imposition of a public register of beneficial ownership via Order in Council on Bermuda both practically and theoretically. Ultimately, the author attempts to answer the broad question of: Is an imposition of a public register of beneficial ownership by the UK in Bermuda justified? To this end, an all-encompassing legal discussion will ensue, utilising academic and practitioner thought, political discourse, and legislative assessment to lend clarity to an emerging legal theme: company ownership transparency broadly, as well as specifically in relation to UK-Bermuda. Standing at the intersection of regulatory policy and international legal relations, this paper finds the exact value of public registers not only questionable in current academic and practitioner thought, but also unnecessary in the unique case of Bermuda. Further, it is found, after analysis of Bermuda’s financial sector, legal framework, and tax system that the imposition of a public register in Bermuda is fundamentally flawed on both a legal and logical basis. Because of the two points made above, it is concluded overall that the UK imposition of a public register in Bermuda cannot be justified.",

The 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive was adopted on 20th May 2015 and came into effect on 26th June 2017. The Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive was adopted on 20th June 2016 and will come into effect on 1st January 2019. The author discusses new reforms focusing on both directives as a measures to tackle tax avoidance practices. The first part describes the basic terms such as the definition and differences between tax evasion, tax avoidance and tax planning in relation to harmful tax competition. The causes of harmful tax competition in the EU are clarified and there is a brief description of the current practices of the corporations. The evolution of the corporate taxation provides a background to the recent developments of combating tax avoidance. The main part of the study focuses on the contribution of policy to prevent tax avoidance in the EU, and especially the impact of the recently adopted Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive and the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. Overall, the critical review assesses the impact and problems of the directives on the achievement of harmonised tax competition and steps which are necessary to accomplish the end of tax avoidance practices in the EU.",

The author explains the range of factors that can be taken into consideration to measure the level of CBI. Chapter 1 focus on the functions of a CB with particular emphasis on monetary policy and price stability as the primary objective of a CB as well as financial stability and its regulatory role in the financial system. Chapter 2 gives an overview of CBI, its importance and discusses the different types of CBI and its relation with accountability. Chapter 3 measures the level of CBI in the selected Caribbean jurisdictions using their CB’s Acts. An analysis is done based on the four (4) legal indicators stipulated in the Cukierman, Webb and Neyapti (CWN) index. Chapter 4 further provides theoretical and empirical evidence illustrating how CBI is greater in developed countries than developing countries by looking at the CWN legal indicators as well as the actual turnover rate (TOR) of governors at the CB of Belize as compared to the Bank of England (BoE).",

In this study, a traffic model is constructed using SIDRA that essentially consists of an advanced suite of functionalities which are broadly adopted worldwide in comprehensive transport planning studies and analyses. Junction Analysis is becoming an important scope in project commencement to measure the effect of a particular developer’s traffic toward the transportation network. Jalan Ipoh Lumut (FT 100), Manjung, Perak is a busy arterial road. In addition, there are also intersections with unacceptable traffic conditions during peak hours. Under such circumstances, appropriate traffic management plan is necessary to improve the road safety as well as traffic conditions along Route FT 100. It also will measure the current traffic condition by using SIDRA for Level of Services (LOS).",

Agis Ardiansyah, SH, LLM Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email: dharmayantysafira@gmail.com Abstraksi Konvensi 1951 tentang Status Pengungsi merupakan landasan utama dari perlindungan internasional terhadap pengungsi. Seorang pencari suaka yang sudah diakui statusnya sebagai pengungsi akan mendapatkan hak dan kewajiban penuh yang diatur dalam Konvensi Status Pengungsi Tahun 1951, dan mendapatkan perlindungan di bawah prinsip non-refoulement yang telah secara spesifik diatur dalam Pasal 33 (1) dari Konvensi 1951 tentang Status Pengungsi. Negara diwajibkan untuk tidak memulangkan para pencari suaka maupun pengungsi ke negara asal yang dimana kebebasan dan kehidupannya terancam dengan alasan apapun. Namun, pemerintah Australia menetapkan larangan masuk terhadap pengungsi yang menggunakan perahu dengan mengeyampingkan fakta bahwa para migran mengambil risiko kehilangan nyawa mereka dalam usaha untuk menyeberangi lautan dengan menggunakan kapal demi mencari perlindungan ke negara lain, kebijakan ini diusulkan sebagai salah satu upaya Australia menekan jumlah pengungsi ilegal yang ingin memasuki wilayahnya.

Agis Ardiansyah, SH, LLM Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email: dharmayantysafira@gmail.com Abstract The 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is the cornerstone of international protection against refugees. An asylum seeker who has already acknowledged his status as a refugee will get full rights and obligations that are set forth in the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugee, and get protection under the principle of non-refoulement which have been specifically regulated in article 33 (1) of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. No Contracting State shall expel or return (' refouler ’) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened. However, the Government of Australia set the entry ban against a refugee boat while set aside the fact that migrants run the risk of losing their lives in the attempt to cross the sea by using the boat for the sake of seeking protection to another country, this policy was proposed as one of Australia’s efforts Australia to presses the number of illegal refugees who want to enter its territory. In this study, the author used the juridical-normative methods with the aim to analyze whether the entry ban on refugees who travel by boat by the Australian Government is in compliance according to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugee.

        "abstract": "Design flow estimation for ungauged catchments is considered to be a challenging task in hydrology. Regional Flood Frequency Analysis (RFFA) can be used to estimate design flow for ungauged catchments. Commonly adopted RFFA methods include the index flood method, the rational method and the quantile regression technique. This paper examines the applicability of the generalized additive model (GAM) in RFFA. GAM establishes a well parameterized modelling framework which describes the multivariate and nonlinear characteristics of a complex dataset. This approach allows flexible specification of regression splines to represent the functional relationships between a response variable (i.e. flood quantile) and a suite of temporal and spatial covariates that can be continuous or discrete. This is done using a link function and smooth functions of the covariates such as catchment characteristics. In this study, both the GAM and log-linear model (LLM) are applied in RFFA to a data set of 114 catchments from Victoria State in Australia. Based on independent testing, it was found that GAM generally provides more accurate flood quantile estimates than the LLM. Further study is needed to confirm this finding.",

        "abstract": ": Most of the study carried out in the field of skew bridges is of theoretical nature and does not provide any direct help to engineers designing bridges specially, for Indian loading conditions. Therefore an effort was made to help such engineers in the quick calculations of design live load moments (LLM) for small span skew RC bridges. For these bridges of practical dimension and skew angle as used by design engineers in Indian conditions are selected for the study. Two lane RC simply supported T-Beam bridges with varying skew angle (0 0 to 40 0 at 10 0 interval) and varying span (12 m to 21 m at 3 m interval) were analyzed in STAAD PRO software using grillage analogy method. Two lane bridges mostly have three longitudinal girders and are simply supported on three bearings. The same has been used in the study. IRC vehicles (70R Tracked, 70R Wheeled and Class A as per IRC 6) are used to simulate loading conditions for Indian bridges. Effect of skew is observed on design live load moment at critical location (mid span region) in the girders and the same is presented in charts to ease the calculation. With an increase in skew angle, a reduction in design live load moment (LLM) was observed for outer longitudinal girders while, for middle longitudinal girder, design LLM was not much affected. This trend was observed for all spans from 12 m to 21m. This suggests that skew bridges designed ignoring the skew effects are conservative with respect to the bending moment.",

Furthermore, there is a gap in the literature on the relationship between the academic success of Cambodian American students (CASs) and the parents’ and the children’s factors. Using a structural strain theory of deviance of functionalism theory, this correlational study (a) explored whether education, income, birthplace, and gender of parents and age at immigration and gender of children the determinants of academic success of CASs and (b) examined the dimension of gender practices in CAs’ households that might affect CASs’ academic success. Survey data were collected from a purposive sample of 153 CASs’ parents in Long Beach, CA, using a researcher-developed survey. Multiple linear regression was run for the correlation questions and frequency descriptive statistics were run for the gender practices. Findings indicated a significant relationship (p < .05) between academic success of CASs and the parents’ education in Cambodia and the children’s age at immigration to America. The descriptive statistics determined gender disparity in the participant households that might affect the academic achievement of female CASs. The positive social change implications stemming from this study include recommendations to school administrators, nonprofits, local government, and federal government to collect segregate data on CASs’ academic outcomes, develop social policies and programs, and allocate appropriate fund to support programs and cultural humility and competency training enhancing CASs’ success and parents’ involvement in their children’s education. Determinants of Academic Success of Cambodian American Students by Chanthol Oung LLM, Hong Kong University, 2001 LLB, Faculty of Law and Business Administration, 1992 Dissertation Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy Public Policy and Administration Walden University May 2017 Dedication I am so grateful to my lovely mother, Tuon Nan, who instilled in me the value of education despite having grown up under heinous circumstances: the Cambodian genocide, a Vietnamese occupation, civil war, and gender stereotyping. During the genocide from 1975 to 1979, the educated and professional classes in Cambodia were targeted for extermination, and all educational institutions were categorically abolished. The genocide was followed by the Vietnamese occupation and the civil war in the years between 1979 and 1993. Although basic education was reestablished from nothing, it often took place in the ruins, cottages, or under the trees. The ones who knew more taught the ones who knew less. The students were caught up amidst fighting and shelling. At the time, besides war–related security issues, there was pervasive gender discrimination in education. Cambodian society regarded the education of girls as less important than that of boys. In this view, girls were to be married and supported by their husbands; education was, therefore, unnecessary. Girls were not sent to school due to the combined effects of a legitimate fear for their safety and an illegitimate belief that education would undermine their capacity to be “traditional” girls. My mother, who valued education, cultivated in me a thirst for knowledge at an early age by reciting a poem’s spirit at bedtime that, “education is the most precious for everyone’s life: it cannot be robbed or stolen as property; it is better than food because it can produce food; and the more education you have, the better you are for the present and the future.” Her sweet voice filled my ears and shaped me to be the woman I am today. She also reminded me continuously that she had no property left for me, yet she gave me the chance to study just as the boys did; it was up to me to make the ultimate choice as to whether I would be educated and advance in my life or be a traditional woman and farm for sustenance. I chose the former. Knowing this choice, she did her best on my behalf, sending me to schools, tutoring me at home, and paying for private tutoring when I needed it. With her support, effort, and encouragement, I became a student who was just as competent as the boys were in school. I also dedicate this work to my loving father, Dorn Oung, and to my youngest brother, Veasna Oung, who were both killed by the Khmer Rouge genocidal regime. I do not remember much about my father, but I remember his affection and caring for me. Although living under constant intimidation, fear, and imminent threat for his life, my father was able to bond with me even as genocide raged beyond our family walls. I remember how my father always called me “daughter,” a term of great affection and love in Cambodian culture. He placed me upon his lap as he drove the bullock cart transporting fertilizer to the rice fields. In fact, the last time I saw him was at the gate of a large mango plantation. He had been arrested while working in those rice fields. My two elder brothers and I were there running and crying after him, for he and many other former government officials had been taken there by Khmer Rouge militants. We watched him move off into the distance until we could no longer see him at all. We waited in vain for decades to see his face again. Even after the genocidal regime had been replaced, the war ended, the fighting factions united, and the refugees and internally displaced people repatriated, one memory remains: My father, disappearing into the distance, never to be seen again. Acknowledgments I would like to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation to my Committee Chair, Dr. Victor Augusto Ferreros; my content member, Dr. Lori Demeter; and my URR member, Dr. Kathleen Schulin, for their highly professional guidance, support, patience, and hard work to assist me during the writing of this dissertation. I would also like to provide a sincere and special thanks to the participants for their great contribution in sharing their information and busy time with me during the interview. Also, I would like to thank the pagoda committee members, restaurant owners, and the other place owners who allowed recruitment in or near their venues. The findings will significantly contribute to the literature gap and possible positive social changes.

Finally, I also thank my wonderful daughters, Chanmealea Thou and Katherine Im, and my son–in–law, Chad Im, for their support and understanding during these academic years marked by constant business. They never demanded anything from me but behaved so well and studied so hard for their own futures. I am so very proud of them.

Fakultas Hukum, Universitas Brawijaya Email : ricoaldiano@gmail.com ABSTRAK Perjanjian Terapeutik merupakan perjanjian yang mengatur hubungan antara dokter dengan pasien dalam hal penanganan medis yang dilakukan oleh dokter terhadap pasien. Dalam perjanjian ini, kedudukan pasien dan dokter tidak seimbang dimana pasien berada dalam posisi ketidaktahuan dan meyerahkan segala tindakan kepada dokter. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui dan mengkaji bentuk perlindungan hukum bagi pasien dalam perjanjian terapeutik kaitannya dengan malpraktik. Jenis penulisan ini adalah yuridis normatif, dengan menggunakan metode perundang-undangan ( statue aproach) dan pendekatan konsep ( conceptual approach ) karena yang akan diteliti adalah berbagai aturan hukum yang menjadi fokus sekaligus tema sentral suatu penulisan. Perlindungan hukum terhadap pasien disini tercermin dari Pasal 55 ayat (1) Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan dan UU Nomor 29 Tahun 2004 tentang Praktik Kedokteran. Perlindungan pasien atas tindakan malpraktek dalama perjanjian terapeutik disini terlihat dari Pasal 55 dan Pasal 56 UU No.29 Tahun 2004 tentang Praktik Kedokteran. Dimana dijelaskan bahwa proses penyelesaian sengketa antara dokter dengan pasien disini juga dapat dilakukan melalui dua jalur yaitu melalui jalur hukum (ligitasi) atau jalur diluar hukum (non ligitasi). Selain itu, pasien dalam mengklaim perlindungannya dapat menempuh jalur pidana dengan urutan melaporkan kepada kepada MKEK/MKDKI, melakukan mediasi dan menggugat secara perdata.

Penulisan skripsi ini bertujuan untuk meneliti tanggung jawab hukum facility agent bank terhadap kreditur atas tindakan penyelamatan kredit sindikasi yang bermasalah . Penelitian ini menggunakan metode yuridis normatif. Hasil penelitian adalah facility agent bank hanya bertanggung jawab sebatas apa yang ada pada perjanjian yang dibuat antara facility agent bank sebagai pihak penerima kuasa dengan kreditur sindikasi sebagai pihak pemberi kuasa, dan dalam perannya facility agent bank tidak bertanggung jawab atas resiko yang berkaitan dengan debitur yang melakukan wanprestasi. Pada restrukturisasi kredit sindikasi, apabila kreditur sindikasi tidak berhasil mencapai kesepakatan mutlak mengenai upaya restrukturisasi kredit non performing loan tersebut, maka kreditur yang setuju untuk melakukan restrukturisasi kredit akan tunduk pada perjanjian kredit yang baru, sedangkan kreditur yang tidak ikut dalam upaya restrukturisasi kredit tersebut, akan tetap berpedoman pada perjanjian kredit awal. Selama kuasa dari kreditur sindikasi kepada facility agent bank tidak dicabut, maka kewajiban kreditur boleh tetap diwakili oleh facility agent bank.

The facility agent bank shall not be liable for the risks associated with the debtor performing tort. In the syndicated loan restructuring, if the syndicated creditor fails to reach an absolute agrement on the restructuring of the non-performing loan, then the creditor agreeing to restructure the loan will be subject to the new credit agreement. Meanwhile the creditor not participating in the credit restructuring will remain guided by the original credit agreement. As long as the power of the syndicated creditor to the facility agent bank is not revoked, the creditor’s liability mas still be represented by the facility agent of the bank.

Multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) have emerged as a blind method to segment SI. Compared to principal component analysis, MCR-ALS yields spectra and maps that are physically sound (positive pixel counts and components sum to unity). Another method, which considers log-likelihood maximization (MCR-LLM) based on the noise characteristics, has shown superior sensitivity and precision compared to MCR-ALS, especially for lowcount data [2]. Here, using Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that MCR-LLM is also able to segment SEM-EDS SI exhibiting strongly overlapping peaks much more reliably than MCR-ALS.",

Meskipun begitu peraturan tentang NDA belum diatur sebagai salah satu upaya perlindungan rahasia dagang di Indonesia. Pelanggaran rahasia dagang yang dilakukan oleh pegawai baik ketika ia bekerja dalam perusahaan maupun ketika sudah berhenti bekerja dari sebuah perusahaan banyak sekali terjadi di Indonesia. Tidak adanya pengaturan tentang kewajiban pegawai untuk melindungi rahasia dagang yang dimiliki oleh perusahaan dalam peraturan perundang-undangan memunculkan adanya NDA ini. Tujuan dalam penelitian ini adalah untuk menganalisa rahasia dagang apa saja yang dapat dilindungi pada sebuah NDA yang diatur pada perusahaan dan sejauh mana NDA yang diterapkan pada sebuah perusahaan pada penelitian ini mengambil contoh kasus di PT. Wilmar Nabati Indonesia dalam melindungi rahasia dagang yang dimilikinya. Jenis penelitian ini merupakan penelitian yuridis empiris dengan metode pendekatan studi kasus. Berdasar hasil penelitian yang diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa pada NDA milik PT. Wilmar Nabati Indonesia masih menuliskan secara rancu bagian-bagian dari rahasia dagang yang dimilikinya untuk mengurangi terjadi kerugian apabila terjadi sengketa di pengadilan, selain itu perlindungan secara represif dari NDA yang dimiliki oleh PT. Wilmar Nabati Indonesia masih kurang karena NDA tidak bisa menjadi sebuah perlindungan hukum yang efektif apabila tidak berbentuk surat perjanjian atau diiringi oleh perjanjian lain apabila bentuknya bukan perjanjian Kata kunci : Rahasia dagang, Non Disclosure Agreement",

The method used was normative juridical research with statute and conceptual approaches using grammatical and systematical interpretation. The findings of the study show that the workers who work on multiple companies and registered by the company deserve to get claim over double accident-at-work insurance if an accident happens.

Dalam perkembangannya, hal ini telah menimbulkan masalah konflik jurisdiksi yang sangat mengganggu hubungan internasional antar negara yang berkepentingan di dalam kasus kejahatan tertentu yang bersifat lintas batas teritorial. Kejahatan terorisme merupakan salah satu contoh kejahatan yang bersifat lintas batas teritorial karena tindakannya memiliki dampak terhadap lebih dari satu negara dan sarana dan prasarana serta metoda-metoda yang dipergunakan melampui batas-batas teritorial suatu negara. Kata kunci: Terorisme, yurisdiksi Negara Abstract At present, it is most likely that any type of crimes involves jurisdictions of more than one or two states, instead of just one. In practice, this has sparked jurisdictional conflicts which irk international relations. Terrorism is one example of cross-jurisdictional crime since its impacts afflict more than one country and its facilities and methods are beyond one state‟s territory.

Crowdfunding is a nascent and successful business of raising money through an online platform unlike the traditional sources of financing. Despite the large amounts spent by millions crowdfunding backers worldwide, there is a number of legal concerns that should be taken into consideration before running a crowdfunding campaign or before investing in a crowdfunded project.

Kronik Lenfositik Lösemi/Lenfoma Hastalarımızın Tek Merkezli 5 Yıllık Retrospektif Değerlendirmesi LLM Dergi 2020;4(4):71-78 72 GİRİŞ Kronik Lenfositik Lösemi (KLL), fonksiyonel olarak olgunlaşmamış B lenfositlerin perifer kanı, kemik iliği, dalak ve lenf düğümlerinde monoklonal birikimi ile karakterize bir neoplazidir. Batı toplumunda en sık karşılaşılan lösemi tipidir (1). Batı yarım küredeki insidansı yılda 4.6/100.000 iken; doğu yarım kürede bu oran daha azdır (2). Fakat hastaların büyük bir kısmının semptomsuz olması nedeniyle gerçek sıklığını saptamak zordur. Batıda son yıllarda asemptomatik olguların eski yıllara göre çok arttığı ve %60 düzeyinde olduğu bildirilmektedir (3). Genelikle yaşlı popülasyonda ve ortalama 70 yaş civarında görülen bir hastalıktır. Klinik spektrumu oldukça geniştir. Hastalık asemptomatik seyredebileceği gibi anemi semptomları ya da hipersplenizm bulguları da görülebilir (4). KLL seyri sırasında özellikle kan elemanlarına karşı antikor üretilmesiyle otoimmün sitopeniler gelişebilmektedir (5). Hipogammaglobulinemi gelişebilmesi nedeniyle enfeksiyonlara yatkınlık sık görülmektedir (6). Evreleme amacı ile genellikle Rai ve Binet evreleme sistemleri kullanılmaktadır (7,8). Rai ve Binet evreleme sistemlerinin yanında hastalığın seyrini ve genel sağkalımı etkileyen kötü prognostik belirteçler arasında; erkek cinsiyet, genç yaş, tanı anında lenfosit sayısının yüksek olması, mutlak lenfosit sayısının ikiye katlanması için geçen sürenin kısa olması (lenfosit ikilenme zamanı), sitogenetik anomali bulunması, serum LDH ve β2 mikroglobulin yüksekliği ve kemik iliği diffüz tutulumu gibi faktörler sayılabilir. Moleküler biyolojideki gelimelerle birlikte KLL hastalarında yeni prognostik belirteçler hastaların klinik seyri konusunda yardımcı olmaktadır. CD38 ifadelenmesindeki artış, IgVH genindeki somatik mutasyon bulunmaması, p53 inaktivasyonu kötü prognostik belirteçler olup ve yine FISH bakısı ile delesyon (del) 17 p, del 13 q, del 11q, trizomi 12 tespiti prognozu öngörmede önemlidir (11-13) . Bu çalışmada İzmir Katip Çelebi Üniversitesi Atatürk Eğitim ve Araştırma Hastanesi Hematoloji kliniğinde takip edilen KLL hastalarının geriye dönük olarak demografik verilerini, klinik ve prognostik faktör özelliklerini ortaya koymayı, tedaviye yanıt ve genel sağkalım oranlarını değerlendirmeyi ve bu bilgiler ışığında Türkiye verilerinin oluşumuna katkıda bulunmayı amaçladık. HASTAlAR ve YÖNTEM Çalışmamıza Ocak 2015-Aralık 2019 tarihleri arasında İzmir Katip Çelebi Atatürk Eğitim ve Araştırma Hastanesi hematoloji kliniğinde KLL tanısı alan ve sistemde verilerine ulaşılabilen 216 hasta alındı. Çalışmaya 18 yaş üstü, kadın ve erkek hastalar dahil edildi. Klinik, tam kan sayımı, periferik yayma, kemik iliği aspirasyonu, kemik iliği biyopsisi, flow sitometri ± sitogenetik/FISH değerlendirme ile KLL tanısı konulan hastalar çalışmaya alındı. KLL tanılı hastaların demografik bilgileri, oturdukları bölge, tam kan sayımı, biyokimyasal parametreleri, periferik yayma bulguları, akım sitometrisi, kemik iliği özellikleri, lenfodenopati (Lap) ve organamegali durumları, tedavi başlama nedenleri, sitogenetik durumları, tedavileri ve yanıtları, sağkalım durumları geriye dönük olarak hastane veri programından (probel) ve arşiv dosyalarından taranarak elde edilmiştir. Hastaların prognostik belirteçleri, birinci, ikinci ve üçüncü sıra tedavileri ile tedavilerin yanıtları incelendi. Ayrıca toplam sağkalım (OS) üzerine etki eden faktörler retrospektif olarak değerlendirildi. KLL tanısı ve tedaviye yanıt kriterlerinde, ulusal kanser enstitüsü KLL çalışma grubunun (NCIWG IWCLL) 1996’da yayımlanan ve 2008 yılında gözden geçirilen tedavi endikasyonları kullanılmıştır (14). İstatistiksel Değerlendirme Değişken dağılımları Shapiro Wilk normalite testleri ve Q-Q plotlar kullanılarak değerlendirildi. Örneklem büyüklükleri ve değişken dağılımları göz önünde bulundurularak gruplar arası karşılaştırmalarda Student t testi, ANOVA testi, Mann-Whitney U testi, Kruskal Wallis testi kullanıldı. Eşlenik gruplar arası farklar ise Paired Samples T test ve Wilcoxon testi kullanılarak karşılaştırıldı. Post hoc test olarak Bonferroni testi kullanıldı. Parametrik değişkenler arasındaki ilişkiler Pearson; non parametrik veya ordinal değişkenler arası ilişkiler ise Spearman Korelasyon analizleri ile değerlendirildi. Kategorik değişkenler ise Ki Kare testi ve Fisher’s Exact test kullanılarak analiz edildi. Sonlanım noktası ile ilişkilerin saptanması amacı ile sürekli bağımlı değişkenlerde Lineer Regresyon Analizi, kategorik bağımlı değişkenlerde Logistik ve Cox Regresyon analizleri kullanıldı. İlişkili saptanan öğelerin bağımsız öngördürücülüklerini Results: Of the 216 patients included in the study, 125 were male (57.9%), 91 were female (42.1%), and the median age was 68 ± 10 (3791). As a result of our study, shorter survival was observed in the group with high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) at the time of diagnosis (p= 0.05). During the follow-up, 156 patients (72.3%) did not receive any treatment, while 60 patients (27.7%) received treatment. Considering the survival status of patients according to RAI stages, patients with advanced stage (RAI 3-4) were found to have short survival and it was found statistically significant (p= 0.015). Five-year OS was 86%, progression-free survival was 61%. Conclusion: When patients with CLL with wait and watch protocol necessitate treatment, they should carefully evaluated for choosing the optimal therapy with proper staging and correctly determined prognostic status with cytogenetic and fluorescent insitu hybridization (FISH). For patients who can tolerate complete remission targeted therapy, appropriate and effective chemoimmunotherapy should be started at the right time.",

        "title": "Do Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs Compromise Patient Privacy By Remaining Outside Federal and Most States' Privacy Standards?",
        "abstract": "As the United States gradually adopted a more liberal treatment of patient pain symptoms, a very serious crises began to emerge. [1] The opioid epidemic is not only creating a population dependent on prescription drugs, but it is costing lives. [2] Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs, created to better surveil and protect the public, track the prescribing and dispensing patterns of certain types of prescription drugs classified as \"controlled substances.\" [3] In doing so, Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (\"PDMPs\") store personally identifiable medical information within state electronic databases, some of which would be considered highly sensitive in nature. [4] Storage of this information allows pharmacies and prescribers to monitor what prescription drugs are being dispensed to patients, and in what quantity and frequency. [5] Each state's PDMP law varies by type of identifying information captured in the database, and who may have access to the database. [6] Generally speaking, personally identifiable health and medical information in the United States is afforded certain federal protections, as entities who store such information are governed by a federal regulation known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.  Similarly, some states have created their own privacy laws to address privacy protections of personal information.  Unfortunately, however, PDMPs do not fall within federal or state privacy protection laws.  Thus, PDMPs are not required to comport with privacy and security protections over the personal health and medical information that is stored in the database.  This has caused both patients and providers alike to challenge the constitutionality and legality of the databases. [7] Below I will first describe the history and background of PDMPs, including how they developed and what they function like today.  Then, I will discuss the constitutional challenges that have been made against PDMPs, including cases that illustrate individual privacy concerns regarding prescription drug and medical information, and whether courts have allowed third parties such as law enforcement agencies to access state PDMPs.  I will also discuss the compelling interest of the states when it comes to protecting and promoting the general health and welfare of the population though the use of PDMPs.  Lastly, I will demonstrate that in order to effect a reasonable balance and reduce the variability between state PDMP laws, action from the federal government is required.  The federal government should require PDMPs to comply with a national, standardized law that continues to emphasize the public health purpose of PDMPs, but also requires each state to conform to a national privacy standard.  I firmly recommend that state managed PDMP databases should be treated as \"covered entities\" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, in order to provide a baseline for direction and regulation over state PDMPs.  In doing so, both privacy and security protections will be afforded to individuals whose information is captured by PDMP databases.  [1] Rebecca Haffajee, Preventing Opioid Misuse with Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs: A Framework for Evaluating the Success of State Public Health Laws , 67 Hastings L.J. 1621, 1624 (2016).

The first part tackles historical development of judiciary in Montenegro whereas the second part discusses the constitutional principles underlying the Montenegrin judiciary as well as its organisation and jurisdictions. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate in a synthesized way pivotal milestones of development of Montenegrin judiciary and traditional legal culture which is inter alia an inspiration for contemporary architecture of the court organisation in Montenegro. Understanding the basic features of Montenegrin judiciary requires presentation of historical context of its development. Recently, judiciary has gone through substantial reforms as a result of harmonisation with the EU standards. Amendments of the Constitution and of the relevant legislation aimed at redefining the network of court organisation as well as at improvement of specific institutions such as the Judicial Council. Further strengthening of independence and autonomy of judicial branch of power is the key subtexts of the on-going reforms.",

        "abstract": "Healthcare as a Governmental Duty.  For years, healthcare in the United States has been debated as a basic right supported by the social arguments of need and justice, but with little agreement. [1] However, in the opinion of this writer, when a fundamental service such as healthcare is no longer readily accessible by a large segment of the general population it will become a prime duty of government to provide that service.  Examples of other recognized prime duties include those powers specifically granted to the Federal government under the Constitution, Article I, Section 8, such as the power to declare war, raise and support armies, regulate interstate commerce and provide postal services and roads.  Healthcare has become one of the most needed, least understood, complex, opaque, and expensive services that an individual citizen faces.  One might liken today's healthcare to a world of unregulated interstate commerce where tariffs are levied on goods crossing each border and where each state regulates the health insurance within its borders, thus limiting the size of risk pools and increasing the costs of insurance [2] just as was provided by the McCarran-Ferguson Act (1945) [3] .

In an endeavor to increase the contribution of minorities in the IP field (e.g., startups, women inventors, and women entrepreneurs) to innovation, there is an urgent need to mitigate the invisible barriers and create an environment that allows them to demonstrate their capabilities. This paper focuses on women inventors and analyzes the challenges and countermeasures. \n \nAlthough the number of women in science and engineering fields and entrepreneurs is steadily increasing, the number of women inventors is not rising as much as it should be. As a background, it turns out that there is a persistent gender gap in the acquisition and enforcement of patent rights. To broaden women’s activities in the field of intellectual property (IP), the cooperation of men is essential, as opportunities for joint research between men and women are growing. \n \nThis analysis is based on assumed gender because patent applications do not contain gender information. The advent of more accurate methods for guessing gender information in the IP field will enable more precise analysis.",

        "title": "SECURITY AND PRIVACY OF THE INTEGRATED CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT PART I",
        "abstract": "EDITOR'S NOTE : On January 16, 2020 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published its long-awaited Privacy Framework .  The Privacy Framework enables healthcare organizations to address privacy risk systematically and complements the previously released NIST Cybersecurity Framework and Risk Management Framework.  As the healthcare ecosystem becomes more interconnected and interoperable, healthcare organizations must be prepared to protect the security and privacy of electronic protected health information. When used as a part of an enterprise risk management strategy, the three NIST frameworks enable organizations to identify risks and build business processes that allow interoperability while managing security and privacy risk. Security and Privacy of the Integrated Clinical Environment discuss how the NIST frameworks and methodologies can be used to develop an enterprise architecture that ensures patient privacy and information security.   ARTICLE ABSTRACT : Integration without security and privacy is not interoperability. The integrated clinical environment cannot achieve the goals of improving patient safety, increasing treatment effectiveness, and improving operational efficiency without engineering both privacy and security into clinical systems, institutional health information systems, and health information exchanges The integrated clinical environment is the synthesis of health care providers, medical devices, health information networks and information technology working together to improve patient safety, increase treatment effectiveness, and improve efficiency. Although this is a laudable goal, current research has done little to address security and privacy concerns with the integrated clinical environment. Unfortunately, the concept was born with little focus on security and privacy. The potential for great harm, both physical and emotional, is ever-present in the health care context when information technology is used to assist in the treatment of patients. The basic tenants of information security should be followed when developing an integrated clinical environment—confidentiality, integrity, accessibility, and accountability. Additionally, privacy concerns outlined in the Fair Information Practice Principles—access and amendment, accountability, authority, minimization, quality and integrity, individual participation, purpose specification and use limitation, security, and transparency—must also be addressed when creating an integrated clinical environment. Integration without security and privacy is not interoperability. A health care organization cannot operate an integrated clinical environment in today’s legal and regulatory environment without assurances of security and privacy engineered into the systems. However, frameworks currently exist that enable health care organizations to manage both security and privacy risk throughout the enterprise systematically.  Security and Privacy of the Integrated Clinical Environment will be presented in a series of three articles. The first article, Part I, discusses the basic concepts of interoperability and the integrated clinical environment (ICE), the legal and regulatory framework impacting an interoperable ICE, and an overview of the risks associated with the deployment of an interoperable ICE.  The second article, Part II, will discuss the concept of privacy engineering and the various National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks and methodologies, including the new NIST Privacy Framework, that can be utilized to address both privacy and security risk adequately. Finally, the third article, Part III, will discuss how the Sherwood Applied Business Security Architecture (SABSA) can be used to integrate the frameworks and methodologies presented in Part II into an enterprise architecture to ensure an organization deploying an interoperable, ICE is compliant with their obligation to protect the privacy and security of a patient’s health information.",

Our aim is to present our cases of primary and secondary graft failure in terms of demographical features, treatments and outcomes. Patients and Methods: From 1992, 13 patients who had second HSCT for graft failure (11 primary/2 secondary) diagnosed at our center were included in our retrospective study. The patient characteristics, survival and therapeutic approaches were evaluated. Results: The median age of the group was 29 (range, 16-64), 9 of them were male. 11 patients had primary graft failure diagnosed as follows: 8 bone marrow failure syndromes (aplastic anemia (AA), fanconi aplastic anemia (FAA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 2 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 1 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).

        "abstract": "1 Inleiding In deze bijdrage richten wij ons op de gedragsnormen die gelden voor de namens de rechtspersoon handelende bestuurder(s).1 Deze gedragsnormen kunnen naar huidig recht vooral worden afgeleid uit de jurisprudentie over bestuurdersaansprakelijkheid. Het bestuurdersaansprakelijkheidsrecht heeft in Nederland een belangrijke normerende functie in het maatschappelijke leven: het dwingt bestuurders zich te houden aan de geldende maatschappelijke gedragsnormen. Nu rijst de vraag wat deze gedragsnormen zijn en wanneer sprake is van een normschending. Het Nederlands rechtspersonenrecht kent diverse gedragsnormen die zich richten tot de bestuurder en die hem voorhouden welke gedragslijn van hem wordt verwacht.2 Zo bepaalt artikel 2:9 van het Burgerlijk Wetboek (BW) dat iedere bestuurder tegenover de rechtspersoon verplicht is tot een ‘behoorlijke taakvervulling’ van de hem opgedragen taak. Dergelijke gedragsnormen zijn open van aard: de concrete invulling is in de meeste gevallen contextafhankelijk.3 Om duidelijkheid te krijgen over de concrete invulling van de gedragsnormen moet worden gekeken naar de omvangrijke en soms enigszins onduidelijke jurisprudentie over dit onder-",

        "abstract": "Aim Range shifts are expected to occur when populations at one range margin perform better than those at the other margin, yet no global trend in population performances at range margins has been demonstrated empirically across a wide range of taxa and biomes. Here we test the prediction that, if impacts of ongoing climate change on population performance are widespread, then populations from the high-latitude margin (HLM) should perform as well as or better than central populations, whereas populations at low-latitude margins (LLM) populations should perform worse. Location Global Time period 1898–2020 Major taxa studied Plants and animals Methods To test our prediction, we used a meta-analysis quantifying the empirical support for asymmetry in the performance of high- and low-latitude margin populations compared to central populations. Performance estimates were derived from 51 papers involving 113 margin-centre comparisons from 54 species and 705 populations. We then related these performance differences to climatic differences among populations. We also tested whether patterns are consistent across taxonomic kingdoms (plants vs. animals) and across habitats (marine vs. terrestrial). Results Populations at margins performed significantly worse than central populations and this trend was primarily driven by the low-latitude margin. Although the difference was of small magnitude, it was largely consistent across biological kingdoms and habitats. The differences in performance were positively related to the difference in average temperatures between populations during the period 1985–2016. Major conclusions The observed asymmetry in marginal population performance confirms predictions about the effects of global climate change. It indicates that changes in demographic rates in marginal populations, despite extensive short-term variation, can serve as early-warning signals of impending range shifts.",

The improvement of student engagement is the principal aim of the Learning in Law project embarked upon by the Department of Mercantile Law at the University of the Free State (UFS), South Africa. One of the aims of the project, which is run in collaboration with the university’s Centre for Teaching and Learning, is to help lecturers develop innovative teaching methods and techniques to ensure in-class student engagement. As modern-day students are used to fast access to information, entertainment and social activity via their mobile devices, new teaching methods to catch and hold their attention and promote participation are needed. This contribution not only makes the case for new ways of teaching law in a changing higher education environment, but also suggests specific steps and techniques to be considered, drawing from the experience of the UFS’s Department of Mercantile Law.",

Treatment response can influence the long term results of the disease and assessing this response as early as possible is important in determining treatment strategies. The purpose of this study was to find out whether the decrease in immunoglobulins, following a cycle of chemotheraphy could predict the rate of treatment response, progression free survival (PFS) and overal survival (OS). Patients and Methods: One hundred and fifty-three MM patients who had been newly diagnosed our clinic between January 2007-February 2016 and who had been followed up in our center were evaluated retrospectively. The patients treatments, treatment responses, survival and progression-free survival times were found. The difference between immunoglobulin levels at the time of diagnosis and immunoglobulin levels at the end of first cycle was found. These rates were compared with treatment response, PFS and OS.

Bu sınıflamada; lenfoid neoplazilerin epidemiyolojik, morfolojik, immünofenotipik ve genetik özelliklerinin belirlenmesi tanıda önem taşımaktadır. Neoplazilerin hiçbiri için spesifik bir antijenik belirleyici yoktur. Bu nedenle doğru tanı için morfolojik özelliklerin antijenik panel ile birlikte değerlendirilmesi, yorumlanması bazen moleküler verilerin eklenmesi gereklidir. Bütün gelişmelere karşın birbiriyle örtüşen özellikler gösteren ve kesin ayırıcı tanı yapılamayan sınır olgular hala bulunmaktadır. Lenfomaların büyük kısmı, en hızlı ilerleyen kanser türlerinden biri olmasına karşın, tedavi başarısı oldukça yüksektir. Günümüzde lenfomanın patogenezi ile ilgili yapılan çalışmalar ve bunların tedavisinde her geçen gün kullanıma giren hedef ilaçlarla yapılan tedavilerin geliştirilmesiyle tedavideki başarı daha da artmaktadır (1). Her bir lenfoma hastası için tedavi kendine özgüdür; hücre tipine, hastalığın evresine, hastanın yaşına, hastanın tedaviyi kaldırıp kaldıramayacağına ve lenfoma tipinin hızlı ya da yavaş seyirli oluşuna göre belirlenir. Kısaca etkin tedavi ancak doğru tanı ile mümkündür. Lenfomada tedavi başarısı çok yüksek olup, yetersiz tedavi hastalığın yanıtsız kalmasına, fazla tedavi de kısa ve uzun dönemde önemli yan etkilere yol açabilmektedir. Ayrıca pahalı ve ithal ilaçların gereksiz ve yanlış kullanımı ülke ekonomisine yük getirmektedir. Bu durumun en aza indirgenebilmesi için hastaların etkin tedaviye yönelik ilaç kullanımı sağlanmalıdır. Lenfoma tanısı koymak için biyopsi yapmak gerekir. Elde edilen dokular patolog tarafından mikroskop altında incelenir. Günümüzde lenfoma tanısı sadece morfolojik bir tanı olmaktan çıkmış olup morfolojinin yanı sıra immünhistokimya (İHK), akım sitometrisi, floresan in situ hibridizasyon (FISH), polimeraz zincir reaksiyonu (PCR) ve sitogenetik gibi bir dizi yardımcı yöntemlerle ayrımın yapılmasını da gerektirir (2). DSÖ 2016 sınıflandırmasına göre 80 kadar lenfoma antitesi tanımlanmıştır (3). Bazı antitelerin ayrımı için çok çeşitli belirleyiciler ve yardımcı moleküler yöntemlerin kullanılması gerekmektedir. Lenfoma tanısı patoloji içinde ayrı bir uzmanlık alanı gerektirdiğinden çıkartılan dokunun uygun merkeze yönlendirilmesi ve işlenmesi gerekmektedir. Doğru tanı için hematopatoloji alanında gelişmiş tanı yöntemlerinin uygulanabileceği laboratuvar ve deneyimli patoloji uzmanlarına gereksinim bulunmaktadır. Ülkemizde patoloji raporu yazım yetkisi olan tüm patologlar lenfoma tanısı koymakta ve hastalar bu tanılarla tedavi edilmektedirler. Maalesef bu merkezlerde her zaman yardımcı moleküler yöntemler ve gerekli tüm belirleyiciler kullanılmamaktadır. Bu nedenle ülkemizde lenfoma ile ilgili sorunların bir bölümünü hastalıkların tanısı ve tiplendirilmesi konusundaki eksiklikler oluşturmaktadır. Lenfoma tanısı konulmuş olgularda; gelişmiş tanı yöntemlerinin mevcut olduğu bir merkezde bu konuda deneyimli bir patologdan ikinci görüş alınması tanısal yaklaşımda eksiklikleri gidermek için gereklidir (4,5). Biz bu çalışmamızda Türkiye’nin çeşitli merkezlerinden hematopatoloji ile ilgili tanı doğrulanması amacıyla merkezimize 2006-2010 yılları arasında 4.5 yıllık dönemde gelen lenfoma tanısı almış hastalarda ilk ve ikinci tanılar arasındaki tanı uyumunun değerlendirilmesini, tanı değişikliğinin oranını ve tanı değişikliğinin sonuçlarının hastanın tedavisini ne şekilde etkileyeceğinin araştırılmasını, karşılaşılan tanı uyumsuzluğunun getirdiği tıbbi ve ekonomik kayıpların somut olarak ortaya konulmasını amaçladık.",

        "title": "Assessment of Disclosure In European Prodrug Patent Claims",
        "abstract": "The article discusses the concept of disclosure in European patent applications involving prodrugs and active metabolites thereof. The article begins with an introduction to the scientific aspects of prodrug design to understand their meaning and difference from common drugs. It is followed by legal analysis discussing the notion of “disclosure” as an element of assessing novelty and inventive step. The article argues that the “disclosure” should be broken off into scientific disclosure affecting novelty criteria and disclosure as an element of enablement to judge the inventive step. The arguments of the article is based on the ruling of the United Kingdom (“UK”) landmark case Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals v. Norton Limited and Penn Pharmaceuticals that has dealt with the assessment of novelty criteria by separating scientific disclosure from disclosure through use. As analyzed in the article, novelty assessment based on the disclosure doctrine may destroy the novelty criteria because of scientific “gaps” that may exist in the parent drug leading to potential infringement by the second-generation claim. The article also discusses the applicability of the inventive step requirement by analyzing relevant case law concluding that differently from the novelty criteria, the later should be applied differently considering explicitly available information about prior art or in other words, enablement of disclosure. Therefore, the notion and extent of the disclosure have a versatile impact on the assessment of the patentability criteria depending on whether it targets the novelty or the inventive step requirement. I. THE SCIENCE BEHIND PRODRUGS Many of the most common medicines are not effective in treating a large number of patients because of the genetic makeup that is responsible for determining how a specific drug reacts in a human body. The common ASSESSMENT OF DISCLOSURE(DO NOT DELETE) 5/20/2019 9:08 PM 430 CHICAGO-KENT JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Vol 18:3 drug research involving a vast quantity of drug molecules cannot provide targeted solutions that can overcome physiochemical, biological or other barriers in drug efficiency and/or toxicity. Because of the genetic makeup, some people metabolize drugs slowly leading to toxic accumulation of the drug or some people metabolize drugs too quickly which may result in inefficiency of the drug action in the human body. When a new chemical entity shows barriers or limitations about its utility, it cannot be developed further into a therapeutic agent. 1 During the research phase, the most common problem related to the development of new drugs concerns solubility problems. Even with the use of current computational “filters” to minimize this problem, 2 compounds that are active in vitro may lack adequate pharmacokinetic properties and/or may be difficult to formulate.3 Striving to improve the properties of a given drug and overcome the negative side effects of an existing drug, prodrugs have become valuable tools for modern drug development. A prodrug is a pharmacologically inactive substance4 that must go through a chemical or enzymatic transformation to become effective inside the body. Thus, the therapeutic rationale behind prodrugs is to enhance the properties of the parent drug once metabolized in the body. According to Huttunen, prodrug strategy has been used to increase the selectivity of drugs for their intended target. 5 These types of drugs are striving to offer safer and better-targeted treatment options in modern medicine. Metabolites6 that are closely related to prodrugs are eventually formed as a result of a natural biochemical process of degrading and eliminating compounds. Therefore, to differentiate between prodrugs and metabolites, it can be said that if the pharmacological effect of a medication is due to the transformation of a drug into a metabolite, the medication may 1.

ASSESSMENT OF DISCLOSURE(DO NOT DELETE) 5/20/2019 9:08 PM 2019 ASSESSMENT OF DISCLOSURE IN EUROPEAN PRODRUG 431 be called “a drug” and an “active metabolite”.7 If, on the other hand, the said effect is due to the release of the drug from a larger chemical entity, then the medication is called “drug” and “prodrug.” Prodrugs can masked forms of active drugs that are designed to be activated after an enzymatic or chemical reaction once they are into the body.8 Considering that during the R&D process of the parent drug it is not always possible to foresee all its properties, prodrugs as second-generation products seek to modify some of the shortcomings of the parent drug pertaining to absorption, distribution or metabolism. The active metabolite that is eventually responsible for the drug’s in vivo pharmacological effect differs structurally from the existing prodrug that is administered to the patient. 9 A small structural modification, however, may result in major differences in biological activity.10 Thus, second generation products can not only serve as a more efficient treatment option but also provide a high return on investment for a pharmaceutical company. The development of medicine using an active ingredient, the safety, and efficacy of which have already been established, is normally less time consuming, less expensive, and less risky than using a compound about which little is known.11 From the intellectual property law perspective, it is important to consider that prodrugs are inactive derivatives of drug molecules that were already contained in the parent drug that is developed to overcome therapeutic barriers in drug delivery. It means that in most cases prodrugs are simple chemical derivatives that are only one or two chemical or enzymatic steps away from the active parent drug as it incorporates an active molecular entity within another molecular structure. To illustrate this, according to a study, 49 percent of all prodrugs are targeted at the formation of esters, which means that they are structurally like the parent drug.12 Some of the recently approved prodrugs include a very controversial Sofosbuvir that is challenged by the European Patent Office (“EPO”). 7.

ASSESSMENT OF DISCLOSURE(DO NOT DELETE) 5/20/2019 9:08 PM 432 CHICAGO-KENT JOURNAL OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Vol 18:3 From a legal point of view, prodrugs may offer a valuable opportunity to extend the life cycle of the parent drug. It is estimated that prodrugs account for 5-10 percent of the overall global drug market.13 Most patents targeting prodrugs are related to oncological research although the range of truly innovative drugs is, according to the same study, not more than 5-10 percent, which suggests that many of these patents are small improvements or adjustments of currently existing drugs. Considering that prodrugs are mainly applied for as secondary patents, they can add 6.3 additional years to the product life cycle.14 According to Kapczynski, depending on the category of independent secondary patents, formulation patents when applied as secondary independent claims add approximately 6.5 years of patent life, secondary independent claims for salts, polymorphs, esters, etc., add 6.3 years and independently claimed a method of use claims add 7.4 years. 15 According to the European Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry executed by the European Commission, applications on second generation patents for bestselling medicines is a common strategy to evergreen product lifecycle. The number of second generation patents rises significantly at the end of basic patents. 16 The Inquiry found that in 40 percent of cases first-generation patents are followed by second-generation patents and the average time before the launching of the second-generation patent was estimated to take place 1.5 years before the expiry of the basic patent. 17 Kapczynski has observed that independent secondary patents are not obtained randomly but rather the propensity to obtain secondary patents increases after successful sales suggesting they reflect deliberate attempts by branded firms to lengthen their monopoly for more lucrative drugs.18 The EC Pharmaceutical Inquiry Report revealed a primary to a secondary patent ratio of 1:7 meaning ",

        "abstract": "Hospital-acquired infections are infections sustained as a result of hospitalization. Nationwide, these account for many injuries and deaths each year. In an attempt to lower hospital-acquired infection (HAI) rates, the federal government has implemented a system of rewards and penalties for participating hospitals who report hospital-acquired infection rates. This system involves ranking hospitals according to reported HAI rates, and tracks improvement in rates each year. Using both rank and improvement data, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) simultaneously rewards hospitals under its Value-Based Purchasing Program, and penalizes hospitals under its Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Program. Hospitals ranking in higher quartiles and hospitals demonstrating improved HAI rates (i.e., lower HAI rates) can receive bonuses. Ironically, many prominent academic medical centers have been on the receiving end of penalties because they fall in the bottom quartile rank for HAI rates. With the current system of rewards and penalties, some hospitals may be tempted to underreport infection rates. This puts hospitals at risk for False Claims Act liability. The following article looks at tracking hospital acquired infection (hereafter “HAI”) rates to improve hospital quality and safety. It examines the current system of rewards and penalties for reported HAIs. It looks at the perception of federal agencies such as the Office of Inspector General, the CMS, and the Centers for Disease Control on the validity of reported HAI rates. It then describes the False Claims Act, focusing on implied certification and materiality, using applicable case law as context, including the seminal FCA case, Escobar . Finally, it urges a serious consideration of connecting Conditions of Participation to compliance with HAI reporting requirements.",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of febrile neutropenia during the mobilization on stem cell collection and graft quality. Patients and Methods: Between 2001 and 2007, 84 adult patients with lymphoma (n= 45) or myeloma (n= 39) underwent PBSC mobilization with chemotherapy plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the obtained data was analyzed retrospectively. Results: Median age was 47 years (range 17-64 years). Overall, 47 (56%) patients experienced febrile neutropenia during the mobilization. We found no harmful effect of neutropenic fever on the success of stem cell mobilization and graft quality. In addition, NF did not effect on to the progression of high dose therapy as well. We also observed that NF did not impact on engraftment kinetics in patients who underwent high dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue.

Otolog kök hücre nakli (OKHN)’nde hastanın kendisinden toplanan kök hücreler yüksek doz tedavi (YDT) sonrası hematopoietik yeniden yapılanma amacı ile hastaya geri verilmektedir. Bu durum kemoterapiye duyarlı malignitelerde yüksek doz tedavi için en önemli kısıtlayıcı faktör olan kemik iliği yetmezliğinin aşılarak, daha yoğun tedavilerin uygulanabilmesini sağlamaktadır. Hematopoietik kök hücrelerin çevre kanına mobilizasyonunu sağlamada sıklıkla tek başına granülosit koloni uyaran faktör veya kemoterapi ile birlikte granülosit koloni uyaran faktör (G-CSF) kullanılmaktadır. Son yıllarda sitokinler ve kemoterapötik ilaçlar dışında hematopoietik öncü hücrelerin kök hücre çevresiyle bağlantısını kesen küçük molekül inhibitörleri kullanımına başlanmış ve bu ilaçlar kök hücre mobilizasyonu başarısını artırmıştır (1-4). Mobilizasyon başarısını olumsuz etkileyen bazı faktörler arasında daha önce alınan kemoterapi rejimleri (alkilleyici ilaçlar, immün modülatörler vb.), kemoterapi sayısı, yaş, radyoterapi maruziyeti gibi faktörler mevcuttur (5-9). Kök hücre miktarı otolog periferik kök hücre destekli YDT sonrası hematopoietik yeniden yapılanma ve graft fonksiyonu açısından, hastalıktan ve mobilizasyon başarısından bağımsız olarak önemli bir faktördür (10,11). OKHN için en az ve optimal CD34+ kök hücre miktarı 2 x 10/kg ve 4-5 x 10/kg’dır (11,12). Kök hücre mobilizasyonu esnasında kullanılan kemoterapötik ilaçların neden olduğu nötropeni nedeni ile sürece enfeksiyonlar eşlik edebilmektedir. Kök hücre mobilizasyonu sırasında gelişen febril atakların kök hücre miktarı ve hasatı başarısı üzerindeki etkileri ilgili çalışmaların sayısı azdır. Bu çalışmada kemoterapi ile otolog kök hücre mobilizasyonu esnasında gelişen febril nötropenik atakların mobilizasyon başarısı ve engraftman kinetikleri üzerine etkisinin olup olmadığı araştırılmıştır.",

        "abstract": "Background Although shiatsu has been taught in specialized schools in Japan since 1940, there is a limited amount of research for its practice. As a result, authors substitute shiatsu with acupressure to use available research on acupressure. It is the position of the authors that, while the two share common aspects, they are substantively different. This project was undertaken to describe technical differences and advocate for a clear distinction, especially in research studies and academic discussions. Methods To understand whether it is appropriate to include acupressure studies in the evidence for shiatsu an analysis of the references included in a frequently cited systematic review was conducted to collect information about the protocols. In addition, a preliminary exploration of shiatsu practitioners’ perceptions about the differences between shiatsu and acupressure is described. This exploration used videos of shiatsu and acupressure techniques and asked practitioners to comment on their perception of similarity. Discussion The results identified several key technical differences between the two, including type of pressure applied, the positioning of the thumb, and the way in which body weight is used. Researchers should separate shiatsu and acupressure in their designs and purposively choose one or the other. To facilitate such clarification, we have proposed a definition for shiatsu that may facilitate the differentiation between these two techniques. Conclusion The authors hope to stimulate discussion about the differences between shiatsu and acupressure, and to question the appropriateness of using acupressure studies as evidence of the efficacy of shiatsu. A true understanding of the efficacy of shiatsu cannot be determined until studies use a common definition of shiatsu and discontinue substituting acupressure research for evidence of shiatsu efficacy. When this happens, it is proposed that a clearer picture of the safety, efficacy, and mechanism of action of both shiatsu and acupressure will emerge.",

        "abstract": "\n \n \n Type of funding sources: None.\n Background\n Prosthetic valve thrombosis (DVT) is a  very serious complication, with high morbidity and mortality, a high risk of stroke during hospital admission, and which occurs especially in patients with poorly anticoagulated mechanical prostheses.\n Therapeutic options available for DVT are surgery, with or without prosthetic replacement, and intravenous thrombolysis. However, there is no randomized study comparing these two interventions. Therefore optional treatment is controversial. This is also reflected in the current clinical practice guidelines of international scientific societies of the year 2017, where the American College of Cardiology / American Heart Association considers surgery and thrombolysis as comparable treatments (Class I), and On the other hand, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) opts for surgery, leaving thrombolysis only for when surgery is not available, has a very high risk or for cases of right valve thrombosis.\n Purpose\n In our center we have used a thrombolysis regimen with low doses of t-PA and in slow infusion with adequates results, proposed by Özkan et al. with 25 mg of t-PA administered over 25 hours, repeating this dose up to DVT resolution or a maximum of 8 times.\n Methods\n We reviewed eleven patients, all with mechanical valve prostheses, six treated with surgery and five with systemic thrombolysis. Of the latter, two cases were treated with a high-dose and accelerated t-PA regimen (10 mg bolus and 90 mg in 2 hours) and the other three cases with low and ultra-slow doses (25 mg in 25 hours). We consider the normalization of the mean transvalvular gradients and the resolution of regurgitation in cases of prosthetic insufficiency a successful result. The mean age was 62.6 years and the mean time from surgery to DVT of 84.9 months. Most of the patients belonged to class III and IV of the NYHA. Anticoagulation was subtherapeutic in 80% of cases. The thrombolysis success rate was 100%.  Of the three cases of ultra-slow pattern, only one of them required a second dose. No side effects or complications were observed. In the surgery group, two patients died during hospital admission as a result of shock and a state of low postoperative cardiac output. In the thrombolysis group, there was only one deceased at 8 months, although not related to DVT related to metastatic melanoma.\n Results\n We observed a full success rate in the resolution of DVT, with no complications in cases of thrombolysis compared to surgery. Bolus ultra-slow infusion of t-PA is equally effective in resolving DVT, although logically with less bleeding risk due to the dose used and the time of administration, without embolic events having been observed due to slower lysis of the thrombus or new thrombosis during a year of follow-up.\n \n \n \n According to our results treatment with low-dose and ultra-slow t-PA regimen will be the initial therapeutic option in clinical practice guidelines given the safety, low cost, and efficacy.\n Abstract Figure. valvular thrombosis.

        "abstract": "Naturopathic medicine is now regulated or semi-regulated in six of Canada’s seven most populous provinces, yet there has been minimal research on the beliefs and attitudes of naturopathic doctors (“NDs”). This multidisciplinary paper begins with a systematic review of the laws governing naturopathic medicine in Canada’s six regulated provinces. It then examines the results from an original dataset based on a 2019 survey of Canadian NDs in the six provinces with some level of regulation. NDs were asked questions about demographics, governance and representation, and the public understanding of naturopathic medicine. De-mographically, most respondents were young, female, relatively new to practice, and science-educated prior to entering their naturopathic medical program. In terms of governance, most respondents believe recent regulatory changes have been positive, especially for their patients, though Ontario respondents were the most critical. Likewise, most respondents expressed positive attitudes about their national and provincial promotional organizations, and satisfaction was strongly associated with membership. However, respondents did not believe naturopathic medicine is understood by the Canadian public, medical doctors, and especially the media. For all the integration of naturopathic medicine into provincial legislation governing health pro-fessions over the past 15 years, Canadian NDs still perceive that their profession is poorly understood. As naturopathic medicine has become more professionalized across Canada and globally, future health policy and legal researchers should focus on how naturopathic medicine is viewed by patients and other medical professionals within the Canadian health care system.",

        "abstract": "Objectives To determine the impact of restrictions on mobility on reducing transmission of COVID-19. Design Daily incidence rates lagged by 14 days were regressed on mobility changes using LOESS regression and logit regression between the day of the 100th case in each country to August 31, 2020. Setting 34 OECD countries plus Singapore and Taiwan. Participants Google mobility data were obtained from people who turned on mobile device-based global positioning system (GPS) and agreed to share their anonymized position information with Google. Interventions We examined the association of COVID-19 incidence rates with mobility changes, defined as changes in categories of domestic location, against a pre-pandemic baseline, using country-specific daily incidence data on newly confirmed COVID-19 cases and mobility data. Results In two thirds of examined countries, reductions of up to 40% in commuting mobility (to workplaces, transit stations, retailers, and recreation) were associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence, more so early in the pandemic. However, these decreases plateaued as mobility remained low or decreased further. We found smaller or negligible associations between mobility restriction and incidence rates in the late phase in most countries. Conclusion Mild to moderate degrees of mobility restriction in most countries were associated with reduced incidence rates of COVID-19 that appear to attenuate over time, while some countries exhibited no effect of such restrictions. More detailed research is needed to precisely understand the benefits and limitations of mobility restrictions as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to help structure the risk landscape associated with large-scale Language Models (LMs). In order to foster advances in responsible innovation, an in-depth understanding of the potential risks posed by these models is needed. A wide range of established and anticipated risks are analysed in detail, drawing on multidisciplinary expertise and literature from computer science, linguistics, and social sciences. We outline six specific risk areas: I. Discrimination, Exclusion and Toxicity, II. Information Hazards, III. Misinformation Harms, V. Malicious Uses, V. Human-Computer Interaction Harms, VI. Automation, Access, and Environmental Harms. The first area concerns the perpetuation of stereotypes, unfair discrimination, exclusionary norms, toxic language, and lower performance by social group for LMs. The second focuses on risks from private data leaks or LMs correctly inferring sensitive information. The third addresses risks arising from poor, false or misleading information including in sensitive domains, and knock-on risks such as the erosion of trust in shared information. The fourth considers risks from actors who try to use LMs to cause harm. The fifth focuses on risks specific to LLMs used to underpin conversational agents that interact with human users, including unsafe use, manipulation or deception. The sixth discusses the risk of environmental harm, job automation, and other challenges that may have a disparate effect on different social groups or communities. In total, we review 21 risks in-depth. We discuss the points of origin of different risks and point to potential mitigation approaches. Lastly, we discuss organisational responsibilities in implementing mitigations, and the role of collaboration and participation. We highlight directions for further research, particularly on expanding the toolkit for assessing and evaluating the outlined risks in LMs.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, AI research has become more and more computationally demanding. In natural language processing (NLP), this tendency is reflected in the emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. These powerful neural network-based models can be used for a range of NLP tasks and their language generation capacities have become so sophisticated that it can be very difficult to distinguish their outputs from human language. LLMs have raised concerns over their demonstrable biases, heavy environmental footprints, and future social ramifications. In December 2020, critical research on LLMs led Google to fire Timnit Gebru, co-lead of the company’s AI Ethics team, which sparked a major public controversy around LLMs and the growing corporate influence over AI research. This article explores the role LLMs play in the political economy of AI as infrastructural components for AI research and development. Retracing the technical developments that have led to the emergence of LLMs, we point out how they are intertwined with the business model of big tech companies and further shift power relations in their favour. This becomes visible through the Transformer, which is the underlying architecture of most LLMs today and started the race for ever bigger models when it was introduced by Google in 2017. Using the example of GPT-3, we shed light on recent corporate efforts to commodify LLMs through paid API access and exclusive licensing, raising questions around monopolization and dependency in a field that is increasingly divided by access to large-scale computing power.",

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of training a multi-layer over-parametrized neural network to minimize the empirical risk induced by a loss function. In the typical setting of over-parametrization, the network width $m$ is much larger than the data dimension $d$ and the number of training samples $n$ ($m=\\mathrm{poly}(n,d)$), which induces a prohibitive large weight matrix $W\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times m}$ per layer. Naively, one has to pay $O(m^2)$ time to read the weight matrix and evaluate the neural network function in both forward and backward computation. In this work, we show how to reduce the training cost per iteration. Specifically, we propose a framework that uses $m^2$ cost only in the initialization phase and achieves \\emph{a truly subquadratic cost per iteration} in terms of $m$, i.e., $m^{2-\\Omega(1)}$ per iteration. Our result has implications beyond standard over-parametrization theory, as it can be viewed as designing an efficient data structure on top of a pre-trained large model to further speed up the fine-tuning process, a core procedure to deploy large language models (LLM).",

Multiple packet losses, Markovian communication constraints, and superposed process noise are considered simultaneously. In order to reduce the channel load during communication, at every step, just one transmission node is permitted to send data packets. Hence, a Markovian communication protocol is utilized to arrange the packets of these transmission nodes. Moreover, multiple data packet dropouts occur during transmission due to an imperfect communication channel. Therefore, the global observation information cannot be obtained by the state estimator. The real state of Markov chain is assumed to be unknown to the estimator except the transition probability matrix. By means of the innovation analysis approach and orthogonal projection principle, we design Kalman-like estimators in a recursive form. Finally, through simulation experiments, we verify the effectiveness and superiority of the designed algorithm.",

In this paper, we approach this question by examining BERT’s knowledge of lexical semantic relations. We focus on hypernymy, the “is-a” relation that relates a word to a superordinate category. We use a prompting methodology to simply ask BERT what the hypernym of a given word is. We find that, in a setting where all hypernyms are guessable via prompting, BERT knows hypernyms with up to 57% accuracy. Moreover, BERT with prompting outperforms other unsupervised models for hypernym discovery even in an unconstrained scenario. However, BERT’s predictions and performance on a dataset containing uncommon hyponyms and hypernyms indicate that its knowledge of hypernymy is still limited.",

        "abstract": "Although Takagi–Sugeno–Kang (TSK) fuzzy classifier has been applied to a wide range of practical scenarios, how to enhance its classification accuracy and interpretability simultaneously is still a challenging task. In this paper, based on the powerful stacked generalization principle, a deep TSK fuzzy classifier (D-TSK-FC) is proposed to achieve the enhanced classification accuracy and triplely concise interpretability for fuzzy rules. D-TSK-FC consists of base-building units. Just like the existing popular deep learning, D-TSK-FC can be built in a layer-by-layer way. In terms of the stacked generalization principle, the training set plus random shifts obtained from random projections of prediction results of current base-building unit are presented as the input of the next base-building unit. The hidden layer in each base-building unit of D-TSK-FC is represented by triplely concise interpretable fuzzy rules in the sense of randomly selected features with the fixed five fuzzy partitions, random rule combinations, and the same input space kept in every base-building unit of D-TSK-FC. The output layer of each base-building unit can be learnt quickly by least learning machine (LLM). Besides, benefiting from LLM, D-TSK-FC's deep learning can be well scaled up for large datasets. Our extensive experimental results witness the power of the proposed deep TSK fuzzy classifier.",

Using this methodology, two series of energetic materials were created on the basis of a duo of triazoles, 5-amino-3-(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole (TT), and a trio of triazoles, 4,5-di(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-2H-1,2,3-triazole (TTT). Their nitrogen-rich salts were also synthesized. Compound TT exhibits an excellent onset decomposition temperature (Td = 341 °C), which is superior to that of the conventional heat-resistant explosive hexanitrostilbene (HNS) (Td = 318 °C). The nitrogen-rich salt 4,5-di(3,4-diamino-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)-2H-1,2,3-triazolium 3,4,5-trinitropyrazol-1-ide (TTT-1) exhibits both remarkable detonation properties and low sensitivities (Dv = 8715 m s-1; P = 32.6 GPa; IS > 40 J; FS > 360 N), which are superior to those of the traditional explosive LLM-105 (Dv = 8639 m s-1; P = 31.7 GPa; IS = 20 J; FS = 360 N). Therefore, this methodology of building a multi-aminotriazole system could effectively assist in the design of thermally stable and mechanically insensitive energetic materials in future exploration.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a new grid synchronization control scheme for integrating a 3-phase PV system to a grid. The Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS) algorithm uses the fixed value for leak factor, which causes the weight vector to drift beyond its limit. Hence the proposed control scheme comprises of an adaptive Variable Leaky Least Mean Square (VLLMS) algorithm to generate Reference Inverter Current (RIC) which overcomes the aforesaid drawback, Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm for Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and a Sliding Mode approach to generate switching signals. The MPPT is designed with RL algorithm for extraction of maximum power from PV panels during varied solar insolations. Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) is designed for generation of switching signal to Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) during dynamic loading condition. The proposed VLLMS-RL-SMC control algorithm is first implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, then on a prototype PV experimental setup developed in the laboratory. The performance of the proposed VLLMS-RL-SMC algorithm is compared with that of other control schemes namely Leaky Least Mean Square-RL-SMC (LLMS-RL-SMC), Least Mean Fourth (LMF)-RL-SMC and Instantaneous Power Theory-RL-SMC (IPT-RL-SMC) in which RL is used for MPPT as in case of VLLMS-RL-SMC scheme for steady state and dynamic loading conditions. From the comparison, it is observed that the proposed VLLMS-RL-SMC algorithm outperforms amongst above three control schemes.",

        "title": "The impact of climate change on extensive and intensive livestock production systems",
        "abstract": "The majority of animal scientists and livestock producers are fully aware and accept that the livestock production sector contributes to factors causing climate change and that in turn livestock production will also be affected by climate change. These effects will be both direct and indirect (Houghton et al., 2001). The impact of climate change on animal production has been categorized as the following: 1) availability of feed in the form of grain, 2) pasture and forage crop production and quality, 3) health, growth, and reproduction, and 4) diseases and the spread thereof (Rotter and Van de Geijn, 1999). In this article, the potential impact of projected climate change on the different livestock production systems (extensive and intensive) will be discussed in general with emphasis on the adaptation aspect. It is, however, important to put the livestock production sector into perspective before speculating on potential future changes. What do we mean when we talk about livestock production and what is the definition of livestock? It is defined as domesticated animals raised in an agricultural production system with the aim of producing food, fiber, and labor. Sometimes, reference is only made to ruminants, such as cattle, sheep, and goats but this definition should include all livestock which fits the original description, including poultry, pigs, and so on. Over time the livestock sector has increased in size and relative production output, especially in intensive animal farming practices (Muir, 2011). The increase in intensive beef cattle production in beef feedlots is due to the increasing global demand for protein (Millen et al., 2011; Costa Junior et al., 2012). In Brazil, Costa Junior et al. (2012) reports that the number of beef cattle fed in feedlots has more than doubled since 2012. Verge et al. (2008) ascribe this to the fact that this increase was driven by both population increases and the increased demand for higher rates of protein inclusion in human diets. A positive correlation exists between the expansion of beef cattle enterprises and those for the other species, where the same trend is observed. This increase has also been observed by the IPCC where an estimated 1.4-fold increase in numbers for cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats, and a 1.6and 3.7-fold increase for pigs and poultry, respectively, has taken place since 1970s (Smith et al., 2014). Livestock systems, especially in developing countries, are extremely dynamic and various drivers of change can be identified. This includes increasing populations and incomes which are combining to drive considerable growth in demand for livestock products. This is projected to continue well into the future (Delgado et al., 1999), although at diminishing rates (Steinfeld et al., 2006). A second feature of the growing demand for livestock products is the shift in the location of production. An example of this is the rapid urbanization of (particularly monogastric) livestock production (the landless monogastric production system—LLM systems), followed in time by ruralization again. This second ruralization move is primarily in response to environmental drivers, meaning that after the initial urbanization, the pressures on resources and environmental pollution forces these production systems to less densely populated rural areas again. In addition to the factors associated with the “livestock revolution” (Delgado et al., 1999) and “livestock in geographic transition” (Steinfeld et al., 2006), other drivers may have far-reaching impacts on the livestock sector in the coming decades: the green agriculture movement (organic food, fair trade, etc.) and the increasing importance of fodder crops being grown for biofuel, for example. There may be considerable impacts of climate change on agricultural systems in the future, but it is clear that climate change is only one of several key drivers of change. Other factors such as population Implications",

        "abstract": "Background\nIn older persons, muscle loss is accelerated during physical inactivity and hypoenergetic states, both of which are features of hospitalization. Protein supplementation may represent a strategy to offset the loss of muscle during inactivity, and enhance recovery on resumption of activity.\n\n\nObjective\nWe aimed to determine if protein supplementation, with proteins of substantially different quality, would alleviate the loss of lean mass by augmenting muscle protein synthesis (MPS) while inactive during a hypoenergetic state.\n\n\nDesign\nParticipants (16 men, mean ± SD age: 69 ± 3 y; 15 women, mean ± SD age: 68 ± 4 y) consumed a diet containing 1.6 g protein · kg-1 · d-1, with 55% ± 9% of protein from foods and 45% ± 9% from supplements, namely, whey protein (WP) or collagen peptides (CP): 30 g each, consumed 2 times/d. Participants were in energy balance (EB) for 1 wk, then began a period of energy restriction (ER; -500 kcal/d) for 1 wk, followed by ER with step reduction (ER + SR; <750 steps/d) for 2 wk, before a return to habitual activity in recovery (RC) for 1 wk.\n\n\nResults\nThere were significant reductions in leg lean mass (LLM) from EB to ER, and from ER to ER + SR in both groups (P < 0.001) with no differences between WP and CP or when comparing the change from phase to phase. During RC, LLM increased from ER + SR, but in the WP group only. Rates of integrated muscle protein synthesis decreased during ER and ER + SR in both groups (P < 0.01), but increased during RC only in the WP group (P = 0.05).\n\n\nConclusions\nProtein supplementation did not confer a benefit in protecting LLM, but only supplemental WP augmented LLM and muscle protein synthesis during recovery from inactivity and a hypoenergetic state.

        "abstract": "Neuroscience is developing rapidly by providing a variety of modern tools for analyzing the functional interactions of the brain and detection of pathological deviations due to neurodegeneration. The present study argues that the induction of neuroplasticity of the mature human brain leads to the prevention of dementia. Promising solution seems to be the dance programs because they combine cognitive and physical activity in a pleasant way. So, we investigated whether the traditional Greek dances can improve the cognitive, physical and functional status of the elderly always aiming at promoting active and healthy aging. Forty-four participants were randomly assigned equally to the training group and an active control group. The duration of the program was 6 months. Also, the participants were evaluated for their physical status and through an electroencephalographic (EEG) examination at rest (eyes-closed condition). The EEG testing was performed 1–14 days before (pre) and after (post) the training. Cortical network analysis was applied by modeling the cortex through a generic anatomical model of 20,000 fixed dipoles. These were grouped into 512 cortical regions of interest (ROIs). High quality, artifact-free data resulting from an elaborate pre-processing pipeline were segmented into multiple, 30 s of continuous epochs. Then, functional connectivity among those ROIs was performed for each epoch through the relative wavelet entropy (RWE). Synchronization matrices were computed and then thresholded in order to provide binary, directed cortical networks of various density ranges. The results showed that the dance training improved optimal network performance as estimated by the small-world property. Further analysis demonstrated that there were also local network changes resulting in better information flow and functional re-organization of the network nodes. These results indicate the application of the dance training as a possible non-pharmacological intervention for promoting mental and physical well-being of senior citizens. Our results were also compared with a combination of computerized cognitive and physical training, which has already been demonstrated to induce neuroplasticity (LLM Care).",

The estimated reactions to shocks are then used to perform policy-motivated simulations. We find that allowing greater population reactions is a superior policy option. Had Italy experienced the population reactivity of the US, local disparities would have been significantly less, to the same extent as with a sizeable public intervention in areas lagging behind.",

        "abstract": "2,2',4,4',6,6'-Hexanitrostilbene (HNS) is an explosive with better explosion performance than the well-known 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT). Surprisingly, unlike other nitroaromatic explosives, there are limited reports regarding the detection of the HNS, let alone sensing reports on surface residues. In this work, a multifunctional flexible SERS sensor was proposed for the indirect detection of HNS based on the transparent fixate gel pads. The sticky and flexible gel pad can effectively collect any HNS surface residues. The inherent amine groups within the gel pad of which the main ingredient is polyurethane can react with HNS to form the orange Meisenheimer-alike complex. The modification of Ag NPs with halide ions was screened for the best SERS performance. KI-modified-citrate-reduced Ag NPs showed selective but enormous SERS enhancement for the HNS derivative. The detection of HNS in the solution phase was explored, and a linear range of 0.01-25 ppm was achieved. The lowest detectable amount (LDA) of HNS was found to be 50 pg, making it one of the most sensitive methods in literature. It was successfully utilized for the HNS residues sensing on fingerprints and bags with LDAs of 5 and 200 ng, respectively. In addition, other explosives including TATB, LLM-105, RDX, HMX, FOX-7, and TNT were also examined to assess the selectivity of the fixate. It was found that the fixate showed excellent selectivity for HNS.",

However, very few studies have focused on the generation of entities' context. In this paper, we introduce CONTEXT-NER, a task that aims to generate the relevant context for entities in a sentence, where the context is a phrase describing the entity but not necessarily present in the sentence. To facilitate research in this task, we also present the EDGAR10-Q dataset, which consists of annual and quarterly reports from the top 1500 publicly traded companies. The dataset is the largest of its kind, containing 1M sentences, 2.8M entities, and an average of 35 tokens per sentence, making it a challenging dataset. We propose a baseline approach that combines a phrase generation algorithm with inferencing using a 220M language model, achieving a ROUGE-L score of 27% on the test split. Additionally, we perform a one-shot inference with ChatGPT, which obtains a 30% ROUGE-L, highlighting the difficulty of the dataset. We also evaluate models such as T5 and BART, which achieve a maximum ROUGE-L of 49% after supervised finetuning on EDGAR10-Q. We also find that T5-large, when pre-finetuned on EDGAR10-Q, achieve SOTA results on downstream finance tasks such as Headline, FPB, and FiQA SA, outperforming vanilla version by 10.81 points. To our surprise, this 66x smaller pre-finetuned model also surpasses the finance-specific LLM BloombergGPT-50B by 15 points. We hope that our dataset and generated artifacts will encourage further research in this direction, leading to the development of more sophisticated language models for financial text analysis",

With its promising classification performance, DBN-TSK-FC features sharing both the powerful neural representation ability of a DBN and the strong uncertainty-handling capability of an interpretable fuzzy representation. On the one hand, DBN-TSK-FC builds its interpretable fuzzy representation in a hierarchical way by applying the classical fuzzy clustering algorithm FCM to obtain fuzzy partitions on the training dataset. Then, it forms interpretable antecedent parts of fuzzy rules as the corresponding fuzzy representation. On the other hand, DBN-TSK-FC builds its DBN-based neural representation in the other hierarchical way. That is, it applies the existing unsupervised DBN pretraining on the training dataset and then takes the neural representation of all the hidden nodes in the top layer of the corresponding DBN as the set of consequent variables of fuzzy rules. In this approach, both the interpretable fuzzy representation and the DBN-based neural representation are further fused to form the corresponding fuzzy rules quickly by using the least learning machine (LLM) on both the fuzzy rules and the labeling information of the original dataset. Therefore, DBN-TSK-FC is essentially a deep TSK fuzzy classifier from the perspective of fuzzy rules, and it indeed avoids the very slow fine-tuning training required after the unsupervised pretraining of the existing DBN learning. The experimental results on the MovementAAL_RSS dataset indicate the effectiveness of the proposed classifier DBN-TSK-FC.",

        "abstract": "Complex interactions exist between microbiomes and their hosts. Increasingly, defensive metabolites that have been attributed to host biosynthetic capability are now being recognized as products of host-associated microbes. These unique metabolites often have bioactivity targets in human disease and can be purposed as pharmaceuticals. Polyketides are a complex family of natural products that often serve as defensive metabolites for competitive or pro-survival purposes for the producing organism, while demonstrating bioactivity in human diseases as cholesterol lowering agents, anti-infectives, and anti-tumor agents. Marine invertebrates and microbes are a rich source of polyketides. Palmerolide A, a polyketide isolated from the Antarctic ascidian Synoicum adareanum, is a vacuolar-ATPase inhibitor with potent bioactivity against melanoma cell lines. The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for production of secondary metabolites are encoded in the genomes of the producers as discrete genomic elements. A candidate palmerolide BGC was identified from a S. adareanum microbiome-metagenome based on a high degree of congruence with a chemical structure-based retrobiosynthetic prediction. Protein family homology analysis, conserved domain searches, active site and motif identification were used to identify and propose the function of the ∼75 kb trans-acyltransferase (AT) polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal synthase (PKS-NRPS) domains responsible for the stepwise synthesis of palmerolide A. Though PKS systems often act in a predictable co-linear sequence, this BGC includes multiple trans-acting enzymatic domains, a non-canonical condensation termination domain, a bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM), and is found in multiple copies within the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG). Detailed inspection of the five highly similar pal BGC copies suggests the potential for biosynthesis of other members of the palmerolide chemical family. This is the first delineation of a biosynthetic gene cluster from an Antarctic microbial species, recently proposed as Candidatus Synoicohabitans palmerolidicus. These findings have relevance for fundamental knowledge of PKS combinatorial biosynthesis and could enhance drug development efforts of palmerolide A through heterologous gene expression.",

        "title": "Reproducibility of protein x-ray diffuse scattering and potential utility for modeling atomic displacement parameters",
        "abstract": "Protein structure and dynamics can be probed using X-ray crystallography. Whereas the Bragg peaks are only sensitive to the average unit-cell electron density, the signal between the Bragg peaks -- diffuse scattering -- is sensitive to spatial correlations in electron-density variations. Although diffuse scattering contains valuable information about protein dynamics, the diffuse signal is more difficult to isolate from the background compared to the Bragg signal, and the reproducibility of diffuse signal is not yet well understood. We present a systematic study of the reproducibility of diffuse scattering from isocyanide hydratase (ICH) in three different protein forms. Both replicate diffuse datasets and datasets obtained from different mutants were similar in pairwise comparisons (Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) ≥0.8). The data were processed in a manner inspired by previously published methods using custom software with modular design, enabling us to perform an analysis of various data processing choices to determine how to obtain the highest quality data as assessed using unbiased measures of symmetry and reproducibility. The diffuse data then were used to characterize atomic mobility using a liquid-like motions (LLM) model. This characterization was able to discriminate between distinct anisotropic atomic displacement parameter (ADP) models arising from different anisotropic scaling choices that agreed comparably with the Bragg data. Our results emphasize the importance of data reproducibility as a model-free measure of diffuse data quality, illustrate the ability of LLM analysis of diffuse scattering to select among alternative ADP models, and offer insights into the design of successful diffuse scattering experiments.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Nascimento de Oliveira Júnior, G, de Freitas Rodrigues de Sousa, J, Augusto da Silva Carneiro, M, Martins, FM, Santagnello, SB, Campos Souza, MV, and Orsatti, FL. Resistance training volume enhances muscle hypertrophy, but not strength in postmenopausal women: a randomized controlled trial. J Strength Cond Res 36(5): 1216–1221, 2022—Among several possible resistance training (RT) variables to be manipulated, the training volume has been considered as a critical variable to maximize RT-induced hypertrophy. Many of the studies that compared one set of RT with 3 sets have failed to show a difference in muscle hypertrophy in older adults. However, it is not clear whether further increases in RT volume (i.e., 6 sets) would result in even greater RT-related hypertrophy than 3 sets in older adults. This study aimed to investigate whether higher-volume RT (HV-RT) maximizes gains in lean body mass and muscle strength (MS) when compared with lower-volume RT (LV-RT) in postmenopausal women (PW). Fifty-eight PW were randomized into 1 of the 3 groups: control group (CT, no exercise), HV-RT (6 sets per exercise), and LV-RT (3 sets per exercise). Volunteers took part in a supervised training program (leg press 45°, leg extension, leg curl and standing calf raises) and were assessed for leg lean mass (LLM; dual X-ray absorptiometry) and lower limb MS (leg press and leg extension; 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) before and after 12 weeks of RT. Both HV-RT and LV-RT groups increased (p < 0.05) LLM and MS when compared with the CT group. Higher increases in LLM gains were observed for the HV-RT group when compared with the LV-RT group (6.1 and 2.3%, p < 0.001). Both HV-RT and LV-RT groups similarly increased 1RM in the leg press and leg extension. Thus, there seems to be a dose-response relationship between RT volume and muscle hypertrophy, but not for MS gains in PW.",

        "title": "Cognitive Bias in Forensic Science: The Psychological Source of Forensic Errors",
        "abstract": "The 2009 release of the National Academy of Sciences report Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, which published research about the impact of cognitive bias in forensic science, has led the forensic science community in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Netherlands, and other countries to recognize the seriousness of the problem. This article reviews the criticisms of reliability and validity in forensic science and presents classic psychological studies of cognitive bias. These studies have shown that cognitive processes such as sensation and perception, judgment, and decision-making are influenced by such factors as a person’s beliefs, experiences, expectations, memories, motivations, cultural background, and the larger context in which events occur. The studies also have shown that cognitive bias can lead to erroneous examination opinions in forensic areas such as handwriting examination, fingerprint identification, and DNA analysis. Finally, the paper summarizes existing options for limiting forensic cognitive bias. ∗ This essay was translated from the original Chinese and lightly edited by Yuan Gao and Ira Belkin. ∗∗ Wang Jinxi is a professor of law at the China University of Political Science and Law.

        "abstract": "The aim of each volume of this series Guides to Information Sources is to reduce the time which needs to be spent on patient searching and to recommend the best starting point and sources most likely to yield the desired information. The criteria for selection provide a way into a subject to those new to the field and assists in identifying major new or possibly unexplored sources to those who already have some acquaintance with it. The series attempts to achieve evaluation through a careful selection of sources and through the comments provided on those sources. Public Law and Human Rights is a core module in the legal education of the United Kingdom (UK). Throughout the world it is known as common law. While common law consists of case-law and statutes, it has reached its present state by incorporating elements of international law, prerogative power and other legal and non-legal sources such as conventions and customs. This book closely examines the public law (constitution and administrative law) and human rights system of the UK (England and Wales in particular). The reason for the emergence of this book is that other publications do not explain such a complex issue in plain language, which makes it very difficult for those taking an interest, in particular A-level as well as LLB/LLM law students. This book does not repeat material that is available in many textbooks that are in print. Rather, it endeavours to present every topic in plain language and concludes every chapter with a fictitious, explanatory sample case.",

This accelerated decaying error property, however, comes with a high cost filter structure. Using a variable tap-length technique known as the fractional tap-length (FT) algorithm, this article provides an adaptive method to search for the optimum length of LRLS filters. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations are conducted under low noise and high noise conditions. All the simulation results show the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared with fixed length LRLS filters as well as with the fractional tap-length lattice based least-mean-squares (FT-LLMS) algorithm. With a fast convergence rate and a small steady-state error of the tap-length, the proposed algorithm can efficiently track any change in the impulse response and estimate the filter's optimum structure.",

        "abstract": "Abstract It is not currently known if biomechanical factors contribute to low back pain (LBP) during prolonged sitting. Thus, this study recruited 90 participants (61 with no history of LBP, and 29 with) to sit for 1 hour where back electromyography, spine posture, and perceived pain ratings (PPR) were collected. Participants were classified as Pain Developers (PD) or Non-Pain Developers (NPD) based on their maximum PPR. PDs had significantly higher PPR (p = 0.000) and lower number of spine fidgets (p = 0.004) than NPDs. There was a significant interaction between clinical health history and pain group (p = 0.037) for PPR. Besides fidget frequency, there were no biomechanical differences between pain groups. Therefore, sitting-induced back pain does not appear to be due to posture or muscle activity; however, it may be related to micro-movement strategies. Future work should explore fidgeting further and whether healthy PDs are at risk for clinical LBP in the future. Practitioner summary: We have replicated the differential transient sitting-induced pain response observed in previous studies. Pain developers do not sit differently than non-pain developers, although they do appear to move less. More research is warranted to better understand these groups and the relationship between pain developers and future cases of back pain.

        "abstract": "Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) fuzzy systems are well known for their good balances between approximation accuracy and interpretability. Among a wide variety of existing TSK fuzzy systems, most of them are driven by special knowledge since the learned parameters of each fuzzy rule are totally different. However, common knowledge is equally important and useful in practice and hence a TSK fuzzy system embedded with common knowledge should be more intuitive and interpretable when tackling with real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a common and special knowledge-driven TSK fuzzy system (CSK-TSK-FS), in which the parameters corresponding to each feature in then-parts of fuzzy rules always keep invariant and these parameters are viewed as common knowledge. As for its modeling, except the gradient descent techniques and other existing training algorithms, we can obtain a trained CSK-TSK-FS from a trained GMM or a trained FLNN because the proposed fuzzy system CSK-TSK-FS is mathematically equivalent to a special GMM and a FLNN. CSK-TSK-FS has three characteristics: (1) with the classical centroid defuzzification strategy, the involved common knowledge can be separated from fuzzy rules such that the interpretability of CSK-TSK-FS can be enhanced; (2) it can be trained quickly by the proposed LLM-based training algorithm; (3) the equivalence relationships among CSK-TSK-FS, GMM and FLNN allow them to share some commonality in training such that the proposed LLM-based training algorithm provides a novel fast training tool for training GMM and FLNN. Experimental results on UCI, KEEL and epileptic EEG datasets demonstrate the promising classification of CSK-TSK-FS.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mouse and rats are staple model organisms that have been traditionally used for oncological studies; however, their short lifespan and highly prone to cancers limit their utilizationsin understanding the mechanisms of cancer resistance. In recent years, several studies of the non-standard long-lived mammalian species like naked mole rat (NMR) have provided new insights of mechanisms in natural anti-cancer. How long-lived species genetically maintain longevity and cancer-resistance remains largely elusive. To better understand the underlying anti-cancer mechanisms in long-lived mammals, we genome widely identified long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts of two longevous mammals, bowhead whale (BW, Balaena mysticetus) and Brandt’s bat (BB, Myotis brandtii) and featured their sequence traits, expression patterns, and their correlations with cancer-resistance. Similar with naked mole rat (NMR, Heterocephalus glaber), the most long-lived rodent, BW and BB lncRNAs show low sequence conservation and dynamic expressions among tissues and physiological stages. By utilizing k-mers clustering, 75–136 of BW, BB and NMR lncRNAs were found in close relation (Pearson’s r ≥0.9, p < 0.01) with human ageing diseases related lncRNAs (HAR-Lncs). In addition, we observed thousands of BB and BW lncRNAs strongly co-expressed (r > 0.8 or r <-0.8, p < 0.01) with potential tumour suppressors, indicating that lncRNAs are potentially involved in anti-cancer regulation in long-lived mammals. Our study provides the basis for lncRNA researches in perspectives of evolution and anti-cancer studies.

        "title": "Remediation in Foreign Bribery Settlements: The Foundations of a New Approach",
        "abstract": "A handful of nations spearhead the global anti-corruption regime through the transnational enforcement of foreign bribery laws. These laws prohibit corporations with a connection to the enforcing nation from paying or offering bribes to the officials of a foreign nation. Enforcement agencies construe the extraterritorial application of these laws broadly, establishing their global prominence. The most notable example is the United States Department of Justice’s enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA). Enforcement agencies typically resolve investigations against corporations through deferred prosecution agreements and other consensual settlement mechanisms known generally as non-trial resolutions. Fines and penalties paid pursuant to these agreements can extend beyond the billion-dollar mark. In most cases, money paid in fines and penalties goes to the treasury of the enforcing nation. However, a movement has emerged that advocates for the sharing of proceeds of non-trial resolutions with the victims of foreign bribery, namely, citizens and governments in the developing world. This movement is complemented by a small number of instances in which non-trial resolutions have been used to provide remediation in this manner. However, these cases do not reveal a coherent approach to remediation, and enforcement agencies do not have the benefit of any kind of conceptual or practical framework to guide the provision of remediation. The extant literature also fails to consider the many political and practical difficulties of coupling transnational foreign bribery enforcement with a remedial agenda.

First, it offers a conceptual framework to underpin remediation by defining elusive notions such as harm, victimhood, and remediation itself. Second, it presents a list of factors to guide the provision of remediation in foreign bribery cases. The shared benefit of these conceptual and practical frameworks is that they allow remediation in foreign bribery settlements to be approached with newfound precision. These frameworks are ultimately geared toward moving practice forward in this fledging field by improving the consistency of outcomes and developing a body of precedent and best practices.",

Yet, the current dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia may rank among the most vexing water disputes in modern history. The Grand Ethiopian Dam filling is close to completion, and, if no cooperative or legal solution is reached, many adverse consequences will start appearing gradually on the Egyptian share of the Nile River, which may ultimately pose a threat to the African peace. Currently, the international community is standing in vain after multiple unsuccessful attempts at negotiation and mediation. While legal and political scholars have discussed mechanisms and substantive standards applicable to water disputes, no scholarship currently exists regarding the application of those mechanisms and standards specifical to the Nile River dispute. Accordingly, this Article scrutinizes the current legal, political, and quasi-legal mechanisms and substantive standards governing water disputes to determine the most suitable mechanism of dispute resolution to adopt in the Nile River dispute.

        "abstract": "Background: Mathematical deconvolution of multiple biologic pathways simultaneously active in critical illness may aid in the interpretation of clinical data.Methods: Using a systems biology model of COVID-19, we analyze the effect of immunomodulation on diverse patient phenotypes. We define optimal treatment and optimal treatment initiation time, identify biologic programs which determine heterogeneous clinical responses and predict biomarkers of those programs. Finally, we evaluate the utility of model biomarkers for identifying high-risk patients in a clinical database of COVID-19 patients.Findings: We predict patient phenotypes with disparate clinical responses to the same therapy. Older and hyperinflammed patients respond better to immunomodulation than obese and diabetic patients. Optimal treatment initiation time is driven by neutrophil recruitment dynamics, extra-pulmonary cytokine expression, systemic microthrombosis and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in older patients, and by RAS, systemic microthrombosis and trans IL6 signaling for hyperinflamed patients. For older and hyperinflamed patients, IL6 modulating therapy is optimal when initiated very early (<4th day of infection) and broad immunosuppression therapy (corticosteroids) is better later in the disease (between 7th– 9thday of infection). We show that biologic programs identified by the model correspond to clinically identified markers of disease severity,Interpretation: Modeling of COVID-19 pathobiology suggests combinations of patient phenotypes which may lead to disparate outcome when included in a trial with a single intervention protocol. Systems biology modeling thus has potential for suggesting refinements to clinical trial design by aiding in the identification of biologic mechanisms underlying clinical heterogeneity and predicting markers of those mechanisms.Funding: Jain’s research is supported by NIH grants R35-CA197743, U01-CA224348, R01-CA259253, R01-CA208205 R01-NS118929, National Foundation for Cancer Research, Ludwig Cancer Center at Harvard;Advanced Medical Research Foundation and Jane's Trust Foundation.

Using this approach, which takes advantage of strong antisolvent and temperature effects, a lamellar arrangement structure is created consisting of nanosheets containing CL‐20 and TATB, and further coated with dendritic nanometer‐scale TATB. XRD and Raman spectra indicate that CL‐20 in the resulting nanocomposite takes the form of α polymorph owing to the presence of ultrapure water. The HPLC results show that the TATB content of the nanocomposite is 20.2 wt%. When the surface coating of TATB is removed, 8 wt% TATB remains between the internal nanosheets. Due to the multiple desensitization effects of this structure, the nanocomposite has much lower sensitivity, roughly comparable to that of the insensitive explosive LLM‐105. Thermal analysis by thermogravimetry (TG) and differential scanning calorimeter indicates that the thermal decomposition activity of the nanocomposite is higher than those of raw materials, and in addition, its thermal stability is greater.",

Prenatal counselling and appropriate antenatal/perinatal management in these cases are poorly studied and may pose significant challenges. The purpose of this review is to outline specific obstetric risks and to suggest management for mothers who choose to continue with pregnancies with the most common LLMs.\n\n\nRECENT FINDINGS\nIn pregnancies complicated by LLMs where parents opt for expectant management, clinicians should respect parental wishes, whilst openly sharing potential serious maternal medical risks specific for the identified abnormalities. The focus of both antenatal and perinatal care should be maternal wellbeing rather than foetal survival. Follow-up ultrasound examinations and maternal surveillance should be aimed at achieving timely diagnosis and effective management of obstetric complications. A clear perinatal plan, agreed with the couples by a multi-disciplinary team including a foetal medicine specialist, a neonatologist and a geneticist, is crucial to reduce maternal morbidity.\n\n\nSUMMARY\nThis review provides a useful framework for clinicians who face the challenges of counselling and managing cases complicated by LLMs where parents opt for pregnancy continuation.",

The decay of molecular measurements of FIB does not follow a log-linear pattern. This study examined the factors associated with the persistence of Escherichia coli uidA, enterococci 23S rDNA, and Bacteroides thetataiotaomicron 1,6 alpha mannanase in microcosms containing 10% (vol/vol) sewage spiked river water stored at 4°C for up to 337 days. The study estimated the markers' persistence with log-linear models (LLMs) to the best-fit models, biphasic exponential decay (BI3) and log-logistic (JM2) and compared the estimates from the models. Concentrations of B. thetataiotaomicon decreased to levels below detection after 31 days in storage and were not fit to models. BI3 and JM2 were fit to E. coli and enterococci, respectively. LLMs had larger Bayesian information criterion values than best-fit models, indicating poor fit. LLMs over-estimated the time required for 90% reduction of the indicators (T90) and did not consider dynamic rates of decay. Time in storage and indicator species were associated with the persistence of the markers (p < 0.001). Using the T90 values of the best-fit models, enterococci was the most persistent indicator. Our data supports the use of best fit models with dynamic decay rates in water quality models to evaluate the decay of enteric markers.",

        "abstract": "With the proliferation of investor-state treaty arbitration, international investment law has been increasingly caught in a “legitimacy” crisis, with concerns looming large over resultant disruptive effects on human rights. Amid existing scholarship seeking to recalibrate the balance between investment protection and public interests, what is relatively undertheorized is a public international law dimension. In this regard, this Article explores the role of human rights law in integrating human rights considerations into investment tribunals’ decision-making, bridging the normative divide between international investment law and human rights. It makes three contributions. First, it systemizes the normative tensions and potential conflicts between international investment law and human rights, analyzing the primary manifestations and root causes thereof. Second, from the position of a respondent state, this Article typologizes the application of human rights law to investor-state treaty disputes, providing legal grounds to alleviate the potential conflicts between investment protection and human rights. In so doing, it also provides a clearer clarification of the relationship between international investment law and human rights law. Third, this Article evaluates the relative strengths and weaknesses of these human rights arguments, shedding light on how international investment agreements could be reformed to better balance investment protection with noneconomic issues. * Raymond Yang Gao, Global Academic Fellow, Faculty of Law, The University of Hong Kong; PHD Scholar, RegNet, Australian National University; Attorney-at-Law (New York); LLM in International Legal Studies, New York University School of Law.

        "abstract": "In 1965, Gordon Moore came up with a prediction that technology will double itself in every two year. Though there has been certain volatility in his prediction but the essence of it still remains intact. After the invention of retail internet, the prospects of technological advancement have only skyrocketed and this can be seen, without doubt in the times of coronavirus pandemic. Due to COVID-19, educational institutions across the world have been suspended and virtual classes have replaced the traditional face to face lectures all over the world. In this current scenario, it seems that this trend is likely to continue and accelerate with time. Law is a subject which has diverse facets, and its intensity starts from the very beginning. Studying law requires immense reading habit, thirst for knowledge, teamwork, research skills, particularly at master's level, where there is special emphasis on research papers and dissertation. This is not possible without teacher-student interaction which provides a scope for immediate feedback and evaluation.This paper evaluates the use of technology and online classes in imparting legal education at master's level. The study captures and examines the perception of a master level law student about online classes. An Online survey has been conducted on 60 students pursuing LLM from Galgotia University. Students have been questioned about the strength and weaknesses of e-learning, ranging from internet glitches, preparedness to designing and effectiveness of learning in online classes. Educational challenges have also been addressed by analyzing how the structure of online education can be improved through one-on-one interaction. A recommendation emanating from this research is that the academic institutions need to explore the advance technology to reach more students more effectively.",

Simply phrased, if software is intellectual property, then the usual tax implications attached to intellectual property will obtain. Though intuitive, this position is not as straightforward when it comes to acquisition of computer software. One main reason is responsible for the difficulty—the anatomy of computer software. This anatomy forces a more nuanced analysis of the components of a software transaction, and specifically the nature of interest in question. A corollary is that a diverse range of transactions—all involving different and separate interests—are possible. A proper taxation regime requires clarity as to what subject matter is subject to the tax treatment, be it a sale, licence, gift, and so on. The diversity of transactions possible regarding a single copyrighted work, however, anticipate the possibility of varied subject matter, specifically for tax purposes, which possibility diminishes any immediate certainty of the subject matter involved.

However, the diagnosis of GERD associated with CC based on 24-hour esophageal pH-monitoring or favorable response to empirical anti-reflux trials is invasive and time-consuming. Lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) are supposed to be a biomarker for micro-aspiration of gastric content in the respiratory tract. This study was conducted to collect LLMs by the sputum induction technique and observe the relationship among the amount of LLMs, cough severity, parameters of 24-hour esophageal pH-monitoring and therapeutic response. The 24-hour esophageal pH-monitoring and sputum induction were performed on 57 patients with suspected GERD associated with CC. Thirty-four patients were followed up after empirical anti-reflux trials of 8 weeks to record the therapeutic response. Lipid-laden macrophage index (LLMI), a semiquantitative counting of LLMs, showed no significant correlation with the values of 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring at the proximal or remote electrode. No difference in LLMI or DeMeester score, as well as cough symptom association probability, were found between the responders and the non-responders. Reflux symptoms were more common in the responders (50%) compared to the non-responders (6%) (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that LLMI shows limited utility in clinically diagnosing GERD associated with CC as an underlying etiology or in predicting response to anti-reflux therapy.

        "abstract": "For linear discrete state-space models, under certain conditions, the linear least mean squares (LLMS) filter estimate has a recursive format, a.k.a. the Kalman filter (KF). Interestingly, the linear minimum variance distortionless response (LMVDR) filter, when it exists, shares exactly the same recursion as the KF, except for the initialization. If LMVDR estimators are suboptimal in mean-squared error sense, they do not depend on the prior knowledge on the initial state. Thus, the LMVDR estimators may outperform the usual LLMS estimators in case of misspecification of the prior knowledge on the initial state. In this perspective, we establish the general conditions under which existence of the LMVDRF is guaranteed. An immediate benefit is the introduction of LMVDR fixed-point and fixed-lag smoothers (and possibly other smoothers or predictors), which has not been possible so far. Indeed, the LMVDR fixed-point smoother can be used to compute recursively the solution of a generalization of the deterministic least-squares problem.",

Acclimating leaf celery plant (Apium graveolens) via bottom wet culture to increase its adaptability to the tropical riparian wetland ecosystem. Biodiversitas 22: 320-328. Bottom-wet culture was set up for acclimating leaf celery plant prior to cultivation at shallow water table conditions. The aim of this research was to evaluate adaptability of leaf celery plants to riparian wetland ecosystem. Leaf celery was selected as potential candidate since natural habitat of its wild relatives is marshlands. Shading at 0%, 20%, and 60% was applied to reduced tropical sunlight intensity. Results of this study indicated that soil moisture was significantly increased in plants exposed to 60% shading, but leaf SPAD value was not significantly affected. Leaf celery is a perennial vegetable that can be frequently harvested. Weekly harvesting was rewarded with optimum yield and good quality leaves, i.e. high SPAD value (45.73 to 51.89). Delaying harvest to 3 weeks increased total yield but 52.12% of the harvested leaves were non-marketable. Mother plant of leaf celery produced suckers, but number of suckers only moderately correlated with yield (R2 = 0.56). Plants exposed to 60% shading produced significantly less suckers (9.00) than those exposed to full sunlight (12.46) and 20% shading (12.88) Use of zero intercept linear regression model, with length of leaf midrib (LLM) x leaf wingspan (LWS) as predictor, resulted in a geometrically based and accurate leaf area estimation model (LA = 0.3431(LLM x LWS); R2 = 0.87) for compound leaves of leaf celery plant. In conclusion, the most crucial factor in optimizing quantity and quality of yield was weekly harvesting focusing on marketable-size leaves.",

Medical Telemetry is becoming a key tool in assisting patients living remotely where a “Real-time Remote Critical Health Care Monitoring System” (RRCHCMS) can be utilized for the same. The RRCHCMS is capable of receiving and transmitting data from a remote location to a location that has the capability to diagnose the data and affect decision making and further providing assistance to the patient. During the cardiac analysis, several artifacts solidly affect the ST segment, humiliate the signal quality, frequency resolution, and results in large amplitude signals in ECG that simulate PQRST waveform and cover up the miniature features that are useful for clinical monitoring and diagnosis. In this paper, several leaky based adaptive filter structures for cardiac signal improvement are discussed. The Circular Leaky Least Mean Square (CLLMS) algorithm being the steepest drop strategy for dropping the mean squared error gives a better result in comparison with the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm. To enlarge the filtering ability some variants of LMS, Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS), CLLMS, Variable Step Size CLLMS (VSSCLLMS) algorithms are used in both time domain (TD) and frequency domain (FD). At last, we applied this algorithm on cardiac signals occurred due to MIT-BIH database. The performance of CLLMS algorithm is better compared to LLMS counterparts in conditions of Signal to Noise Ratio Improvement (SNRI), Excess Mean Square Error (EMSE) and Misadjustment (MSD). When compared to all other algorithms VSS-CLLMS gives superior SNRI. These values are 13.5616dB and 13.7592dB for Baseline Wander (BW) and Muscle Artifact (MA) removal.",

The problem is formulated as a bi-level mathematical model where the upper level model (ULM) seeks for optimal division of energy storage among Disco and customers, and the lower level models (LLMs) represent the minimizations of the electricity purchase costs of DisCo and customers. Further, in order to enhance the computation efficiency, we transform the bi-level model into a single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) model and linearize it. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the strategy and complement our analysis through case studies.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: This work aims at investigating the influence of some front-end design parameters of a passenger vehicle on the behavior and damage occurring in the human lower limbs when impacted in an accident. Methods: The analysis is carried out by means of finite element analysis using a generic car model for the vehicle and the lower limbs model for safety (LLMS) for the purpose of pedestrian safety. Considering the pedestrian standardized impact procedure (as in the 2003/12/EC Directive), a parametric analysis, through a design of experiments plan, was performed. Various material properties, bumper thickness, position of the higher and lower bumper beams, and position of pedestrian, were made variable in order to identify how they influence the injury occurrence. The injury prediction was evaluated from the knee lateral flexion, ligament elongation, and state of stress in the bone structure. Results: The results highlighted that the offset between the higher and lower bumper beams is the most influential parameter affecting the knee ligament response. The influence is smaller or absent considering the other responses and the other considered parameters. The stiffness characteristics of the bumper are, instead, more notable on the tibia. Even if an optimal value of the variables could not be identified trends were detected, with the potential of indicating strategies for improvement. Conclusions: The behavior of a vehicle front end in the impact against a pedestrian can be improved optimizing its design. The work indicates potential strategies for improvement. In this work, each parameter was changed independently one at a time; in future works, the interaction between the design parameters could be also investigated. Moreover, a similar parametric analysis can be carried out using a standard mechanical legform model in order to understand potential diversities or correlations between standard tools and human models.",

        "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory diseases of the airways are associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and aspiration events. The observation of lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) within the airway may indicate aspiration secondary to GOR. The proposed mechanism, that lipid droplets from undigested or partially digested food are aspirated leading to accumulation in scavenging macrophages, led us to hypothesise that an activated population of LLMs could interact with other immune cells to induce bronchial inflammation. To test this, we generated an in vitro model using differentiated THP-1 cells, which were treated with a high-fat liquid feed. Here, we show that THP-1 cells can take up lipid from the high-fat feed independent of actin polymerisation or CD36-dependent phagocytosis. These cells did not exhibit M1 or M2 polarisation. Gene array analysis confirmed over 8000 genes were upregulated by at least twofold following high fat exposure, and IL-8 was the most upregulated gene. Pathway analysis revealed upregulation of genes known to be involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pathophysiology. We suggest that aspiration and macrophage phagocytosis may be important mechanisms in the aetiology of diseases such as COPD and cystic fibrosis that are characterised by high levels of IL-8 within the airways.

        "title": "Contract Cheating And Academic Integrity In Higher Education:, What Can Universities, Governments And Quality Assurance Agencies Do To Understand, Prevent And Respond To The Challenge?",
        "abstract": "There is a global challenge to higher education posed by “contract cheating”. “Contract cheating” occurs when a student contracts a third party to create an assignment for them, and then the student submits it as their own work. Usually money changes hands, but not always. This particularly insidious form of cheating has been exacerbated by the commodification of higher education and the increasingly popular “sharing economy”. Contract cheating not only threatens the academic integrity of the individual student’s grades and their degree, it also raises suspicion about all the degrees awarded by an institution. Globally, universities have been struggling to combat contract cheating. This paper defines and describes the problem and then summarizes the findings of recent research and offers a comprehensive set of solutions. New Zealand was one of the first countries to criminalize contract cheating. A legal approach is a solution which every country needs to consider because it directly targets the commercial entities creating the product. A pedagogical approach requires universities to be proactive and there are many things which universities can do to manage the problem. A quality assurance approach can involve national quality assurance agencies working with government departments and tertiary education providers to conduct research and provide guidance to all universities. All three approaches are discussed here. This paper draws on recent research produced by accreditation agencies, individual researchers, and university organizations. It refers to contract cheating research in selected countries-especially New Zealand, Australia and the UK-to counteract contract cheating. The solutions proposed here will be of interest to all universities, quality assurance agencies and governments * BA, LLB Hons, LLM Hons, PhD. Correspondence: drmyrawilliamson@gmail.com.

        "abstract": "This paper presents the leaky LMS (LLMS) control for a double stage grid integrated SPV (solar photovoltaic) system. The SPV system comprises the boost converter, voltage source converter (VSC), a ripple filter, and nonlinear loads. The LLMS control has two objectives as follows (1) estimation of fundamental load current components and (2) evaluation of synchronizing signals, which is coupled at POI (point of interconnection). Moreover, this LLMS control algorithm eliminates the load side current harmonics, which improves the power quality. The control algorithm shows many advantages like as (1) it gives a quick response and convergence rate is very fast, (2) harmonics elimination as the capability to cancel the noise, and (3) simple in implementation. The boost converter is connected with the solar PV array and DC capacitor of VSC. Moreover, the boost converter extracts the peak power from the SPV array. The P&O (perturb & observed) based MPPT controller tracks the maximum power from photovoltaic array. Moreover, this solar P&O algorithm has good potential for rapidly solar variation perturbation. The SPV system with LLMS based control algorithm is simulated in MATLAB under PV variation irradiance and unbalanced load conditions. The total harmonics distortion (THDs) of the grid current is achieved as per in IEEE 519 standard.",

Effective January 1, 2121 \nBy George W. Conk, Senior Fellow, Stein Center for Law & Ethics, Fordham University School of Law, with Wenjie Lyu, LLM, Rongrong Zahang, LLM, and Haoshi Jiang, MSL \n \nContemporary Chinese law began afresh in 1978 with the policy of “reform and opening” announced by Deng Xiao Ping, who from 1977 to 1992 was the most prominent of the Chinese leadership. After a half century of war, invasion, and revolution Deng was the architect of a policy of modernization. Universities returned to normal, and China began its rapid economic rise. Important to Deng’s program was the normalization of the legal system which had nearly collapsed. \n \nIn 1986 the legislature – the National People’s Congress adopted the General Principles of Civil Law. embraced a broad swath basic principles of civil law, including liability in tort. Over the next fifteen years law schools were built and progress in the professionalization of the courts was marked as the country adopted laws that brought it into conformity with the international trade system \n \nBut Chinese legal academic leaders traced their emerging law to Germany via Japan and Russia (then the USSR). So their aspiration was to adopt a comprehensive civil code. In 2002 a discussion draft was circulated and moved toward legislative consideration. One Section of that draft civil code dealt with tort liability. But controversy – particularly regarding the law of property – stalled consideration of the tort section of the civil code. I commented on the development of the law of tort and translated the draft code. It was published as A New Tort Code emerges in China An introduction to the discussion and a Translation of Chapter 8 - Tort Law of the Official Discussion Draft of the Proposed Revised Civil Code, 30 FORDHAM INTERNATIONAL LAW JOURNAL 935 (2007) http://ssrn.com/abstract=1015041 \n \nIn 2009 the National People’s Congress passed the Tort Law as a stand-alone law. That law has been the basic framework of China’s tort law since then. But it should be recognized that causes of action are typically grounded in specific laws such as the Traffic Safety Law, the Environmental Protection Law, etc. \n \nBut the basic model that China’s legal authorities have in mind is the Continental civil law best exemplified by the German Civil Code. Development of the comprehensive code progressed slowly. It was intended not to transform the civil law but to provide a foundation for the law as it was in fact being developed by the steadily advancing array of statutory law. In 2017 the first section of the Code was passed as Basic Principles. In May 2020 the National People’s Congress met during the twin crises of instability in Hong Kong and the covid19 pandemic. It passed the comprehensive civil code. \n \no Although it made few substantive changes, the Civil Code formally abolished and replaced the elements which had previously been passed as stand-alone items. They include: \no Marriage Law [婚姻法] \no Inheritance Law [继承法] \no General Principles of Civil Law [民法通则] \no Adoption Law [收养法] \no Guaranty Law [担保法] \no Contracts Law [合同法] \no Rights in Rem Law [物权法] \no Tort Liability Law [侵权责任法] \no General Provisions of Civil Law [民法总则] \n \nThe reader will note that although we use the word “tort” in the title we generally abjure Anglo-American terms of art in order to more accurately capture the Chinese syntax. E.G. we would render 侵害他人承担侵权 责任 as “to bear responsibility for infringement of the rights of another”. \n- GWC \nSeptember 20, 2020",

        "abstract": "A utilização de extratos de plantas medicinais, como a Camomila (Matricaria chamomilla) e a Babosa (Aloe vera), no desenvolvimento de formulações para tratamento de lesões como a úlcera aftosa recorrente apresentam menos efeitos colaterais e tóxicos para o organismo, exibindo inúmeras propriedades (anti-inflamatória, cicatrizante, etc.), vantagens e custo benefício satisfatórios para pacientes. Este estudo tem como objetivo compreender o uso da Babosa e Camomila em úlceras, através de buscas em bancos de dados computadorizados e livros para elaboração de revisão narrativa de literatura. As bases de dados utilizadas foram Google Acadêmico, PubMed e LILACS, acessadas no período de novembro e dezembro de 2018. Critérios de inclusão foram publicações entre 2000 a 2018, em inglês e português, utilizando os descritores: Aloe vera, Matricaria chamomilla, estomatite aftosa, odontologia. O uso da Aloe vera pode ser opção eficaz na promoção da redução de úlcera através de efeito anti-inflamatório, de re-epitelização, ativação de fibroblastos e propriedades imunomoduladoras, podendo contribuir para cicatrização de feridas. Estudos mostraram que pacientes portadores de úlceras aftosas recorrentes, que fizeram uso da pomada à base de extrato fluido de Matricaria recutita (Ad-Muc®), com proposta ação anti-inflamatória, antibacteriana e propriedades auxiliadoras na cicatrização de lesões da mucosa bucal, obtiveram sucesso terapêutico em 94% dos casos. Assim, conclui-se que a utilização de tais fitoterápicos mostra-se necessária e promissora dentro da odontologia e outras áreas de saúde, visando o desenvolvimento de métodos alternativos de tratamento cada vez mais eficazes. Entretanto, mais estudos clínicos precisam ser realizados para confirmar esta utilização em seres humanos.Descritores: Aloe; Matricaria; Estomatite Aftosa; Odontologia.ReferênciasAleluia CM, Procópio VC, Oliveira MTG, Furtado PGS, Giovannini JFG, Mendonça SMS.

        "abstract": "The swift and unceasing spread of COVID-19 has created a new wave of complications that have revealed dozens of issues dishevelled in the gendered and obsolete state management and in the low levels of social development, primarily focusing on the Balkans. With the onset of the pandemic, women with specific diseases belong to the most critical group, given the fact that infection with COVID-19 itself increases the risk of subsequent development of numerous health complications. This text briefly highlights the negative effects of the pandemic on women from several perspectives, trying to fleetingly show its severe impact on a global level and the necessity to improve a system that is barely surviving on already unsteady grounds.\nAuthor(s): Gala Naseva\nTitle (English): The Chasm of Structural Discrimination: Women on the Frontline Against COVID-19\nJournal Reference: Identities: Journal for Politics, Gender and Culture, Vol. 17, No. 2-3 (Winter 2020)\nPublisher: Institute of Social Sciences and Humanities - Skopje\nPage Range: 90-93\nPage Count: 4\nCitation (English): Gala Naseva, “ The Chasm of Structural Discrimination: Women on the Frontline Against COVID-19,” Identities: Journal for Politics, Gender and Culture, Vol. 17, No. 2-3 (Winter 2020): 90-93.\nAuthor Biography\nGala Naseva, Researcher\nGala Naseva (1992, Skopje) is a legal researcher and interdisciplinary artist.

        "title": "Children’s rights budgeting and social accountability: Children’s views on its purposes, processes and their participation",
        "abstract": "Children’s rights budgeting is an international human rights priority and the focus of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child’s 2016 General Comment on Public Budgeting for the Realisation of Children’s Rights. General Comment 19 was informed by a consultation that gathered the views of 2 693 children in 71 varied national contexts across all five UN regions. The article describes the process and findings of this consultation, setting out the views of children across the world as to how their governments should make spending decisions that are sufficient, equitable, efficient, transparent and participatory. The consultation provides unique insights into how children in very different contexts think about the ways in which their governments can and do allocate public funds for children and their families in ways that support or undermine the realisation of their rights. The article identifies some of the barriers to including children in decision making on public spending, but challenges assumptions that they are not able to be or interested in being involved. It suggests that if participatory budgeting is to be effective for children, it will require bespoke forms of social accountability. * The research was undertaken in partnership with the Child Rights Connect Working Group on Investment in Children. The partners on this consultation included: Child Rights Connect along with the African Child Policy Forum, Child Rights Coalition Asia, Defence for Children International, Eurochild, GIFA, IBFAN (International Baby Food Action Network), Plan International, the Latin American and Caribbean Network for the Defense of the Rights of Children (Redlamyc), Save the Children and UNICEF. Plan International and Eurochild provided some of the funding which supported the consultation. All of the partners contributed to the development of the consultation tools and worked to engage the child participants. All partners also commented on the final report.

        "title": "Leiomyosarcoma of the Larynx: A Complex Diagnosis",
        "abstract": "An 84-year-old man was referred to our institution for dysphonia present for 2 months. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated a polypoid lesion of the right true vocal fold with normal motility. Excisional biopsy of a submucosal thickening of the right vocal fold with vocal ligament calcification was performed. Histology revealed squamous cell epithelium without malignancy. Postoperative endoscopic follow-up was regular. Six months after surgery, dysphonia and dyspnea occurred. Flexible laryngoscopy demonstrated right hemilaryngeal paralysis, edema, and partial airway obstruction. Necrotic tissue and purulent secretions were visible at the anterior commissure, right vocal fold, and ipsilateral vestibule. A second microlaryngoscopic surgery included multiple biopsies and debridement of the necrotic tissue. Histological report was negative for malignancy, and purulent chondritis was diagnosed. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was administered with improvement of infection, inflammation, dysphonia, and dyspnea. The patient was discharged. Two months later, a new sudden and severe dyspnea occurred. He was admitted to the emergency department, and oropharyngeal intubation was necessary because of respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed thickening of the right laryngeal wall with wide fluid collection (48-43 mm diameter) that almost completely obstructed the airway, with erosion of the right thyroid and cricoid cartilage (Figure 1). Debridement of the necrotic tissue and drainage of the purulent collection was performed with direct laryngoscopy. Culture was positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis and Candida albicans. Intravenous antibiotic, antimicotic, and corticosteroid therapy was administered, and other 3 surgical debridements and drainage were performed, but without clinical or radiological improvements. Moreover, patient developed signs of sepsis. Since no improvement had been achieved, total laryngectomy was planned even without a positive histologic biopsy. Intraoperative findings showed transglottic extension of the ulcerated material with full-thickness infiltration of the laryngeal wall and external spread through the thyroid cartilage, with invasion of prelaryngeal tissues (Figure 2). The patient’s clinical condition improved, and he started oral feeding without pharyngocutaneous fistula. Morphological and immunohistochemical features were consistent with leiomyosarcoma (Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre Le Cancer [FNCLCC] grade 3; Figure 3). Multidisciplinary consultation suggested adjuvant radiation therapy, but preirradiation staging CT scan showed rapid local recurrence and lung metastasis. The poor clinical condition of the patient contraindicated first-line chemotherapy. Figure 1.

This configuration aims at the maximum utilization of solar energy and the economical usage of other sources. The maximum utilization of solar energy is achieved by harvesting the photovoltaic (PV) array maximum power. The DG set is controlled to operate only when the PV array together BES can’t support the load power. Thus this configuration mitigates the discontinuity in supplying the load demand. A weighted zero-attracting leaky least mean square (WZA-LLMS) adaptive control provides solutions for power quality issues such as reactive power, harmonics and power unbalance in three phases etc. The MATLAB/Simulink platform is used for the modeling and simulation of the microgrid system.",

        "title": "Adaptive Noise Cancellation Techniques for Impedance Cardiography Signal Analysis",
        "abstract": "Impedance Cardiography (ICG) evaluation facilitates the volume of heart stroke in the sudden cardiac arrest. It is a noninvasive method for measurement of stroke volume, cardiac output monitoring and observing the hemodynamic parameters by changes in the body blood volume. Bloodvolume changes caused due to various physiological processes is extracted in the form of the variations in the impedance of the body segment. In the real time clinical environment during the extraction the ICG signals are influenced with several artifacts.As these artifacts are not stationary in nature, we can’t predict their characteristics. Hence,we developed several hybrid adaptive filtering mechanisms to improve the ICG signals resolution. Least mean square (LMS) algorithm is the basic enhancement technique in the adaptive filtering. However, in the non-stationery situation the LMS algorithm suffers with low rate of convergence and weight drift problems. In this paper we developed some hybrid variantsof LMS algorithm those are Leaky LMS (LLMS) for ICG signal enhancement. More over to progress the convergence rate, filtering capability and to reduce the computational complexity we also developed various sign versions of LLMS algorithms. The sign variants of LLMS algorithms are sign regressor LLMS (SRLLMS), Sign LLMS (SLLMS), and Sign Sign LLMS (SSLLMS). Severaladaptive signal enhancement units (ASEUs) are developed based on adaptive algorithms and performance is evaluated on the real ICG signal taken from MIT-BIT database. To ensure the efficiency of these algorithms, four experiments were performed to eliminate the various artifacts such as sinusoidal artifacts (SA), respiration artifacts (RA), muscle artifacts (MA) and electrode artifacts (EA). Among these techniques, the ASEU associated with SRLLMS performs better in the artifacts filtering process. The signal to noise ratio improvement (SNRI) for this algorithm is calculated as 9.3388 dBs, 5.7514 dBs, 8.4449 dBs and 8.7358 dBs respectively for SA, RA, MA and EA. Hence, the SRLLMS based ASEUs are more suitable in ICG signal filtering in real time health care sensing systems.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The objective of the present study was to evaluate the ability of the five times sit to stand test (5TSST), grip strength (GS) and step test (ST) to detect older women with reduced lower-limb muscle strength (LLMS), and to investigate the clinical usefulness of the combination of such tests. One hundred and nineteen older women were submitted to the 5TSST, GS, ST and lower limb peak torque by an isokinetic dynamometer. The capacity of the clinical tests to detect older women with reduced LLMS was measured using the ROC curve, followed by calculation of posttest probability (PoTP). The results show that a ST score of 0.24 cm per cm of participant’s height shows the best PoTP for a positive test (72%). However, the combination of the ST and 5TSST enhances the accuracy from 48% (prevalence of weakness in the population) to 82.6% if both tests are positive, and decreases the PoTP from 48% to 11.4% if both tests are negative. The inclusion of GS provided additional benefits of small magnitude. In conclusion, the ST performed alone or in combination with 5TSST could be an alternative for clinical screening of LLMS reduction in older women. The early identification of impairment of lower-limb muscle strength in independent older adults may favor early intervention and prevention of negative outcomes such as falls and functional limitations.",

        "abstract": "Free expression that leads to the vibrant exchange of ideas is thought to be the very lifeblood of a democratic society. It appears self-evident that campuses, where even the most resolute ‘truths’ not only may but even should be examined and re-examined, are the nucleus of such a society. Despite this, campus speech has become a flashpoint for competing — some would say irreconcilable — demands. On the one hand is the view that some speech should not be tolerated in an environment that must embrace diversity that is also a hallmark of our advanced liberal democracy, and which should aim for the equality of its members. Per this argument, some members of the university community are treated unequally when speech that tends to reinforce their marginalization as members of a sub-dominant group is permitted. This view may also extend to pedagogical practice, and so we might identify the debate as to whether certain words are ipso facto impermissible, regardless of their intended purpose.2 \n  \n*The phrase “symbolic politics” is drawn from Stephen Newman’s article (this issue).**Dr. Kate Bezanson is Associate Professor of Sociology and Associate Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at Brock University.

To this effect an overview of what the Pacific Alliance is, and the way how multiple economic sectors and areas have been integrated during the recent years will be made, specifically focusing on the creation and legal framework of the Latin American Integrated Market. Also, a general overview of the current takeover regulations of the four member countries will be analyzed in order to see where supranational regulation and harmonization is further needed in order to enhance and deepen the integrated market and the economic block as such.

        "title": "The Politics of Cost-Benefit Analysis: A Risky Bet for Environmental Law and Policy in Brazil",
        "abstract": "Seeking to disseminate cost-benefit analysis as part of a global agenda of reforms on regulatory policy, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has advocated this economic tool to all its member countries. A key partner of that international organization since 2007, Brazil officially sought in 2017 to be a permanent OECD member, which means accepting orientation from that organization on policy reforms, namely regulatory policy. This Article disagrees with OECD’s recommendation because traditional cost-benefit analysis has been technically flawed and politically biased towards a deregulatory agenda. The purpose of this Article, therefore, is to analyze the potential impacts of introducing cost-benefit analysis for environmental law and policy in Brazil. To achieve this goal, understanding the particular background and features of environmental law and policy in Brazil becomes essential. In this sense, this Article argues that cost-benefit analysis creates a particular risk to environmental law and policy in Brazil due to at least three factors: (a) it would reinforce the already strong presidential dominance over the regulatory agenda on environmental protection, undermining environmental agencies’ authority and scientific-based decisions; (b) it would imperil any possibility of improvement of the current levels of transparency, participation, and accountability on the decision-making processes for environmental laws and regulations; (c) it conceals a regulatory policy against new and existing laws and regulations on environmental protection.

        "title": "A importância do acompanhamento clínico de lesões brancas potencialmente malignas em mucosa labial: relato de caso",
        "abstract": "Introdução: Quando estamos frente às lesões potencialmente malignas, torna-se imprescindível o acompanhamento rigoroso dessas lesões, pois são lesões frequentes e com risco de transformação maligna consideravelmente relevante, a leucoplasia e a queilite actínica, são as lesões mais comuns encontradas na cavidade bucal. Objetivo: relatar um caso de lesão potencialmente maligna em mucosa labial. Relato de caso: Paciente sexo masculino compareceu à clínica de Diagnóstico VI da Universidade do Oeste de Santa Catarina, com a presença de lesão branca em lábio inferior, o mesmo já se encontrava em acompanhamento há seis anos, com diagnóstico prévio de queilite actínica sem atipia celular (duas biópsias prévias). Aposentado, trabalhava anteriormente como agricultor, ex-fumante e ex-etilista. Clinicamente observava-se lesão esbranquiçada, com aspecto verruciforme, localizada em lábio inferior, medindo 2 cm no maior diâmetro. Além disso, o lábio encontrava-se endurecido, com aspecto roliço. Duas hipóteses de diagnóstico foram levantadas: queilite actínica associada a leucoplasia e carcinoma verrucoso. O paciente foi submetido à nova biópsia incisional. No laudo constatou-se tratar de queilite actínica com displasia epitelial leve e o tratamento proposto foi o uso de protetor labial FPS30, além de acompanhamento clínico semestral. Conclusão: O acompanhamento desse caso clínico foi possível observar alteração no perfil citológico, onde nas primeiras biópsias não era possível observar atipia celular e na biópsia mais recente foi observado uma displasia epitelial leve, portanto o acompanhamento das lesões potencialmente malignas é fundamental para prevenir sua transformação maligna, e uma nova biópsia deve ser realizada sempre que for observada alteração no aspecto clínico da lesão.Descritores: Leucoplasia; Queilite; Biópsia; Lábio.ReferênciasPindborg JJ, Reichart PA, Smith CJ, Van der Waal I.

Moreover, same power converter is also used to diminish power quality issues in PV power generating system. This converter is required a decent control algorithm to indemnify the reactive power, and to reduce distortion in the grid currents. Here, an incremental modified LLMS technique is used, which has fast response as compared to other control techniques. Moreover, the optimized selection of parameters of this control, provides fast convergence speed, good steady state response and an improved power quality at nonlinear loads. For harnessing of peak energy from the solar array, a power optimizer scheme is utilized. The solar energy conversion system provides the grid current balancing, harmonics suppression, power factor correction and maintains the voltage at linear and nonlinear loads at PCC (Point of Common coupling). The presented algorithm is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Its performance is found satisfactory under various operating conditions.",

        "title": "Reflections on social welfare and family law",
        "abstract": "As I formally retire, the editors, my friends and colleagues Mavis Maclean and Dr Emma Hitchings have asked me to write a short piece reflecting on my experiences researching and explaining law. The publication of the Journal of Social Welfare Law, in 1978, marked a growing recognition of the importance for both lawyers and social workers of understanding areas of law such as social security, housing and child care, and the different perspectives each profession brought to examining and improving the operation of the welfare state. As the editors of the Journal noted in their first editorial, this was not simply a marketing device but a reflection of welfare founded in rights and implemented by both lawyers and social workers with complimentary roles enabling ‘clients’ to improve their lives by obtaining their entitlements. ‘Clients’ needed lawyers and social workers who understood each other’s perspectives and could communicate. Understanding law required knowledge of the rules, their operation and their effects so the Journal also gave space to accounts of practice and empirical research. These views echoed my ideals at the start of my involvement with social welfare and family law, which pre-dated the Journal. In 1975, I was appointed as a lecturer at Leicester University and taught family law to law students, integrating the private law on maintenance and property reallocation with the rules on social security to show their real world effects on families, taught law in the School of Social Work and volunteered at the local legal advice service run by academics and lawyers. From 1977, I also taught child welfare law on Leicester University’s innovative LLM in Welfare Law and began socio-legal research with a study for the Department of Health and Social Security on the practice of step-parent adoption and the impact of reforms in the Children Act 1975. The Act discouraged in-family adoption, replacing it with a form of joint custody for step-parents, and, uniquely, imposed a duty on the Secretary of State to provide a report to Parliament on the operation of the Act. The Covid19 pandemic provides a lens for these reflections, sharpening my perspective on the policy choices made now and earlier, and the crucial importance of implementation for effective change. The pandemic has required a new focus on court processes and court reform, raising new questions about access, participation and the performance of justice. It has also magnified my concerns about the lack of regard in the Westminster government for children and young people, their lives and their rights. Currently, the pandemic casts a deep shadow over life for everyone and necessitates new processes, practices and priorities at home, in work and education, and in society at large. However, this does not erase or make less relevant what has already been learned over the last half century. A fairer society necessitates equal treatment in law and practice and support for those already disadvantaged, but inequalities and discrimination remain pervasive; a thorough understanding of problems and mechanisms for addressing these is essential for those trying to design effective solutions;",

Fernandez Arroyo** RESUMO:  Este artigo propoe um debate sobre a desnacionalizacao do Direito Internacional Privado (DIPr), abordando o DIPr como um direito que possui multiplos julgadores e implementadores. Evidentemente, e por mais poderoso que ainda seja, o Estado hoje nao e mais o que costumava ser. No dominio do DIPr, o papel central outrora desempenhado pelo Estado foi progressivamente erodido. De fato, o Estado coexiste com outros atores, publicos e privados. Com base nisso, o estudo destaca que a producao e a implementacao, e, em ultima analise, a eficacia do DIPr dependem consideravelmente de diferentes tipos de atores nao-estatais. As propostas para abordar a evolucao futura do DIPr como uma ferramenta para promover a governanca global nao devem ignorar o papel fundamental dos julgamentos privados e da implementacao privadas. PALAVRAS-CHAVE:  Direito Internacional Privado. Desnacionalizacao. Adjudicacao privada. Implementacao privada. Arbitragem. ABSTRACT: This article proposes a discourse on the denationalization of Private International Law (PrIL), by approaching PrIL as a law with multiple adjudicators and enforcers. Quite evidently, and as powerful as it still may be, the State is nowadays no longer what it used to be .  In the realm of PrIL, the central role once played by the State has progressively been eroded. Indeed, the State coexists with other – public and private – actors. Based on that, the study emphasizes that the fabrication and the enforcement, as well as, ultimately, the effectiveness of PrIL considerably depend on different kinds of non-State actors. The proposals to approach the future evolution of PrIL as a tool to foster global governance should not ignore the fundamental role of private adjudication and private enforcement.

        "title": "The effect of high maternal linoleic acid on cardiometabolic risk in rat mothers and their offspring",
        "abstract": "In pregnancy, linoleic acid (LA), obtained from the maternal diet, is vital for fetal development. LA is metabolised into a number of fatty acid modulators that regulate the endocannabinoid system (ECS), and are key for normal metabolic homeostasis. We are currently consuming elevated levels of LA in Western societies, including during pregnancy. We investigated if elevated maternal linoleic acid is detrimental to the mother and her fetus during pregnancy and early life, and the mechanism for this. The primary aims of this study were to investigate if elevated maternal LA consumption during pregnancy alters: 1) the maternal microbiome; 2) the maternal cardiac ECS; 3) the fetal cardiac ECS at embryo (E) day 20; and 4) cardiovascular development, function and the cardiac ECS in offspring at postnatal (PN) day 40. Effects of LA exposure on an in vitro H9c2 cardiomyoblast model (viability, respiration, glycolytic metabolism) were also assessed. A secondary aim was to test whether any of the latter postnatal effects are reversed with a low LA diet. \nFemale Wistar Kyoto rats were fed a diet high in LA (HLA - 6.21% of energy intake) or a control LA diet (LLA - 1.44% of energy) for 10 weeks prior to mating and throughout pregnancy. At E0, E10 and E20, maternal faeces were collected, and the microbiome analysed by 16S sequencing. At E20 and PN40 maternal and offspring rats were sacrificed, body and organ weights recorded, and mRNA extracted from heart tissue to assess transcription of endocannabinoid signalling targets using real time PCR. Hearts from PN40 rats were also assessed for coronary reactivity, and ventricular diastolic and systolic pressure-volume relationships. In addition, effects of elevated LA exposure on cell viability and mitochondrial respiration were assessed in isolated cardiomyocytes. \nThe current results showed that throughout pregnancy there was an increased abundance of Cyanobacteria and Lentisphaerae, and decrease Verrucomicrobia in the microbiome of HLA mothers. Over time, HLA and LLA diets decreased the abundance of Actinobacteria and Tenericutes. There was an interaction effect for Verrucomicrobia in which pregnancy and diet interacted in influencing its abundance. \nIn terms of effects of LA in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, LA exposure reduced cell viability at concentrations between 300 and 1000 μM. However, there were no effects of an acute exposure to LA on mitochondrial respiration. \nJust prior to birth, an elevated maternal LA diet increased CB2 expression in maternal hearts whereas in her E20 offspring cardiac CB2 expression declined in both sexes. FAAH mRNA expression was unaltered by diet, and appeared higher in female vs. male hearts. There were no effects of a high maternal LA diet on mRNA expression of endocannabinoid receptor GPR18, DAGL alpha and DAGL beta in E20 offspring hearts. \nWe further assessed cardiovascular development/function in adolescent rats. Data demonstrated that there were no changes in heart mass or heart: body weight ratios. Within the heart, no changes in resting or baseline coronary flow rate, or peak coronary reactivity were detected. However, there was a decline in coronary flow repayment during reactive hyperaemia in female hearts that was significant for the LLA maternal / offspring HLA (LHF) compared with LLA maternal/offspring (LLF) group. A trend of declining coronary flow repayment (after 30 s occlusion) was also observed in HLA maternal/offspring LLA (HLM) and HLA maternal/offspring HLA (HHM) compared to LLM and LHM hearts, though this trend did not achieve statistical significance. In terms of left ventricular diastolic mechanics, there was evidence of an increased diastolic stiffness in HHF hearts (an effect not evident in males), together with an unexpected increase in diastolic compliance in HLM/HHM hearts (counter to changes in HHF vs. other groups). Thus, there is evidence of sexually dimorphic effects of LA on coronary and diastolic function in developing hearts. Systolic pressure development was subtly modified, with a trend to reduced contractility (declining slopes of pressure-volume relationships, increased volume required to generate 100 mmHg pressure) in HL and HH diets in both sexes, though this also failed to achieve statistical significance. \nMolecular analysis of PN40 hearts demonstrated CB2, LepR, Notch1, NPPA and TGFB1A mRNAs were all expressed in higher levels in HLM vs. LHM groups (with NPPA also elevated vs. LLM). Expression changes in these mRNAs were not evident in females. Collectively, these changes provide further evidence of a sexually dimorphic effect of maternal diet on myocardial phenotype of offspring. In conclusion, a maternal diet high in linoleic acid alters the maternal microbiome and cardiac ECS signalling. This is associated with distinct ECS signalling changes, and alterations in cardiac metabolism and functionality at embryonic and early postnatal stages in offspring hearts. Male and female offspring demonstrated different pathophysiology, with data at these early life stages suggesting that female offspring of mothers consuming a diet high in LA may in particular exhibit altered cardiovascular makeup and function, and potentially greater risk developing cardiovascular disease later in life.",

        "title": "Artifact Elimination in Impedance Cardiography using Gradient based Adaptive Signal Enhancement Techniques",
        "abstract": "Impedance Cardiography (ICG) is a noninvasive method for indirect measurement of stroke volume, monitoring the cardiac output and observing the other hemodynamic parameters by the blood volume changes in the body. The blood volume changes inside a certain body segment due to a number of physiological processes are extracted in the form of the impedance variations of the body segment. The ICG analysis provides the heart stroke volume in sudden cardiac arrest. In the clinical environment desired ICG signals are influenced by several physiological and non-physiological artifacts.As these artifacts are not stationary in nature, we proposed adaptive filtering techniques to eliminate the artifacts. In this paper we used Least Mean Square (LMS), Least Mean Fourth (LMF), Median LMS (MLMS), Leaky LMS (LLMS), and Dead Zone (DZLMS) adaptive techniques to eliminate artifacts from the desired signals. Several adaptive signal enhancement units (ASEUs) are developed based on these adaptive techniques, and evaluated on the real ICG signal components. The ability of these algorithms is evaluated by performing the experiments to eliminate the various artifacts such as sinusoidal artifacts (SA), respiration artifacts (RA), muscle artifacts (MA) and electrode artifacts (EA). Among these techniques, the DZLMS based ASEU performs better in the filtering process. The signal to noise ratio improvement (SNRI) for this algorithm is calculated as 11.9140 dB, 7.3657 dB, 10.4060 dB and 10.5125 dB respectively for SA, RA, MA and EA. Hence, the DZLMS based ASEUs are well suitable for ICG filtering in the real time health care monitoring systems.",

        "title": "Validation of ultrasonographic muscle thickness measurements as compared to the gold standard of computed tomography in dogs",
        "abstract": "Objective The objective was to quantitatively evaluate the validity of ultrasonographic (US) muscle measurements as compared to the gold standard of computed tomography (CT) in the canine. Design This was a prospective study. Population Twenty-five, client-owned dogs scheduled for CT as part of a diagnostic work-up for the management of their primary disease process were included. Materials and Methods Specific appendicular (cubital flexors and extensors, coxofemoral flexors and extensors) and axial (temporalis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, lumbar epaxials) muscle groups were selected for quantitative measure based on CT planning and patient position. Prior to CT scan, the skin over the muscle sites was shaved and marked with a permanent marker. Patient body position was determined based on the patient’s CT plan; positioning was consistent between CT and US imaging. To ensure identical imaging position for both CT and US measurements, radio-opaque fiducial markers were placed directly over the skin marks once the dog was positioned. Quantitative measurements (cm) for both lean muscle mass (LMM) and subcutaneous adipose (SQA) were recorded. Statistical comparisons between CT and US values were done separately for each site and type. Results Muscle groups and associated SQA measured by US and CT were not statistically different based on an adjusted p-value using Bonferroni’s correction (p < 0.0031). In addition, all LMM and SQA sites had good reliability and agreement (Cronbach’s α = 0.8 − 1.0) between the two metrics, excluding the coxofemoral extensor muscle group (Cronbach’s α = 0.73232). Linear regression analysis of muscle measures indicated close agreement (slope range 0.93–1.09) and minimal bias of variation (intercept range 0.05–0.11) between CT versus US modalities, with the exception of the coxofemoral extensor muscle. Similarly, SQA CT and US measures indicated close agreement with the slope range of 0.88–1.02 and minimal bias of variation with an intercept range of 0.021–0.098, excluding the cubital flexor and extensor groups. Additionally, the R2 values for these remaining LMM and SQA sites are reported as >0.897 for LLM and >0.8289 for SQA. Conclusions Ultrasound imaging of selected appendicular and axial muscle groups in dogs can provide comparable assessment of muscle thickness to the current gold standard, CT. In consideration of both statistical reliability to CT and cage-side accessibility, the temporalis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and lumbar epaxial LMM sites are considered the most useful targets for US LMM assessment in the canine. Our findings support the potential utility of US as a clinical tool in veterinary medicine to assess LMM status in patients. Additional studies are indicated to develop standardized protocols of its use in a cage-side setting and to elucidate the benefit of this modality, in conjunction with nutritional interventions, to manage body LLM stores in compromised patients.",

        "title": "State security, securitisation and human security in Africa: The tensions, contradictions and hopes for reconciliation",
        "abstract": "External actors have predominantly driven the securitisation agenda in Africa with the architecture traceable to Africa’s immediate post-independence past. This article theorises about a double-faced securitisation process in Africa – ‘securitisation from outside’ influencing ‘securitisation within’. The theoretical framework is used to identify three phases of securitisation in Africa. The first phase started during the Cold War era when Africa was inserted into the Cold War politics to fight proxy wars for either the west or the east. As a result, the big powers overlooked human rights and democratic concerns on the continent and focused on promoting their security interests by propping dictatorial and predatory regimes to do their bidding. The second phase connects with the fall of the Berlin Wall, which brought hope of ending the securitised environment in Africa with its attendant expansion of the political space for civil society and political party activism to flourish. This development resulted in the emergence of the African Union to replace the Organisation of African Unity and to introduce principles that shifted from a state-centred to a human-centred security focus. However, the human security project could not work due to tensions with the securitisation of the development agenda being promoted by the donor community. The third phase is the declaration of the ‘War on Terror’ which has moved the focus toward a ‘risk/fear/threat’ project. In response, most African leaders have adeptly exploited this new environment to their advantage * LLB (Ghana) LLM (Dalhousie) DCL (McGill). Senior lecturer, School of Law, University of Ghana.

        "abstract": "In this paper, Ciccone's () approach is applied to the Spanish case in 2011 but by estimating it using local labor markets (LLMs) instead of NUTSâ€ 2 or NUTSâ€ 3 regions. It is especially relevant in the case of Spain because the NUTSâ€ 3 (provinces) are large regions in comparison with other cases in Europe. From a sample of income taxpayers published by the Spanish Fiscal Studies Institute, we derive figures on average wages by worker on the scale of LLMs. We argue that working at this level of spatial disaggregation is more in line with the idea of externalities from agglomerations, which are generated on a local scale. We can also observe intraâ€ regional heterogeneity and how the urban wage premium changes along the entire distribution of cities, including smallâ€ medium size urban areas or rural areas. The empirical analysis is based on several estimation strategies, namely, ordinary least squares, twoâ€ stages least squares, quantile regressions (QR), and instrumental variable quantile regressions (IVQR) estimators; they all find a significantly positive effect of agglomeration in the conditional mean of wages. This result can be estimated along the conditional distribution of wages. According to the QR and IVQR estimates, important variations are found along the distribution.",

        "abstract": "We argue that rising supply of experience not only reduces experienced workers' relative wages but also their relative labor market participation. From a theoretical model we derive predictions which we quasi-experimentally investigate, using variation across U.S. local labor markets (LLMs) over the last decades and instrumenting experience supply by the LLMs' age structures a decade earlier. We find that aging substantially reduces experienced workers' relative wages and employment rates, and also their labor market participation rates. Our results imply thatthe effect of demographic change on labor markets might be more severe than previously recognized, as it reaches beyond wages.",

But the signal\nacquired from the subject may not be noise free and may be non stationary.\n\n\n\nBefore going for the analysis of the acquired signal a preprocessing on the acquired signal is\nrequired to make it noise free. In the present work in first phase, the acquired vibration signal is filtered\nto reduce the noise and to improve the SNR (signal to noise ratio). The filtering is done by an Adaptive\nNoise Cancellation (ANC) technique. A modified Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS) based adaptive\nalgorithm along with a digital filter is used to achieve the ANC. The signal acquired from a healthy gear\nis used as the reference signal for the adaptive filter based de-noising process. In the second phase of the\npresent work Adaptive Wavelet Transform (AWT) is used to detect the fault by extracting the features\nfrom the filtered vibration signal. From the signal pattern the adaptive wavelet is designed. The adaptive\nwavelet scalogram is compared with the standard wavelet scalogram.\n\n\n\n The result shows that the adaptive wavelet scalogram is better in analyzing the vibration signal.\nIn this work a gear drive experimental set-up is made. Two different types of defective gears are used\nfor the experiment. In type-1 defective gear one tooth is broken and in type-2 defective gear two teeth\nare broken. Initially, the vibration signal is acquired from a healthy gear which is used as the reference\nsignal. Then the vibration signal from type-1 defective gear and type-2 defective gear is acquired and\nprocessed for the analysis and to identify the defects.\n\n\n\nThe present work shows that with the application of modified-LLMS algorithm and AWT\nthe proposed technique of signal processing is more suitable for the fault identification and hence for the\ncondition monitoring of the gear.\n",

        "title": "Cross Border State Sales and Use Taxation After South Dakota v. Wayfair: A New Paradigm for E-Commerce",
        "abstract": "For over 50 years, U.S. Supreme Court precedents held that state sales taxes could not be constitutionally applied against retailers with no physical presence in the taxing states. As a result, many states implemented use tax laws to supplement sales tax laws, essentially requiring each resident consumer to self-report and pay taxes on purchases made from out of state retailers. However, these use tax laws were largely ignored. Moreover, with the advent of online retail (“e-tail”), many sales on which states previously collected sales tax from local stores essentially converted to “tax-free” sales because many online sellers (“e-tailers”) had no physical nexus to the states in which the products were delivered. As online sales continued to take up a larger percentage of all purchases, states struggled to secure sales and use tax revenue consistent with the physical nexus standard. In recent years, many states implemented laws that required e-tailers to collect sales taxes not based upon physical presence, but upon annual dollar value or number of sales into the states (called, “economic nexus”). However, enforceability of the economic nexus laws was questionable in light of past U.S. Supreme Court decisions. Additionally, with more than 9,600 sales taxing jurisdictions with varying rules and rates, many argued that compliance would create an undue burden * Norman S.

        "abstract": "Putting together this special issue of The Law Teacher, and writing this editorial, has been an intense and in some ways enjoyable experience, but also a highly emotional and personally resonant one. Working on Brexit and the Law School has meant reflecting on our past experiences, present lives and future plans. We want to be transparent about our own positions, because they obviously influence our knowledge and understanding, the agendas we set and research questions we ask, including those that informed the discussions in the workshops that preceded this special issue and the papers within it. Hence, we begin this editorial by writing about ourselves and our experiences of UK law schools, before turning to the stories that we believe that this project on Brexit and the Law School is telling. We are both mid-career women working in Northern English law schools: pre-1992, civic institutions with global perspectives and ambitions. Those law schools are roughly similar in terms of staff and student numbers. Sheffield has a high proportion of undergraduate students from the “Northern corridor” from Liverpool to Hull. Leeds also draws large numbers from this area, but has perhaps more from the Midlands, London and the South, and more overseas undergraduate students. Sheffield sends roughly a third of its undergraduate students on a year abroad, many to Europe under the Erasmus+ scheme. Leeds sends fewer (over 10% every year) with more going to destinations outside the EU. Both schools have LLM programmes that recruit predominantly non-EU overseas students, and not much EU law is taught within those programmes. Both of us have experience of leadership of and/or within those law schools (in Hervey’s case also within others in the North of England and Midlands), and are thus particularly conscious of the make-up and aspirations of our student bodies. We also both have experience as external examiners, through periodic review or other quality assurance processes, and as “Research Excellence Framework (REF) critical friend”, of a number of other UK-based law schools, including in the south of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and in both the preand post-1992 sector.

        "title": "Childhood Obesity and Positive Obligations: A Child Rights-Based Approach",
        "abstract": "Childhood obesity is one of the most serious current public health challenges. Its prevalence has increased at an alarming rate. The World Health Organization estimated that in 2016 the global number of overweight children under the age of five was over 41 million. Although there is widespread concern about the rising rates of childhood obesity, there is not as much consensus on how to address the problem. Obesity has been mostly considered either a matter of personal responsibility or of parental responsibility when it concerns children. Inadequate attention has been given instead to the obligations borne by States to prevent and combat child obesity under international human rights law. This Article seeks to remedy such gap in the current research by discussing a comprehensive child rights-based approach that imposes positive obligations on States to prevent childhood obesity through the realization of children’s rights to adequate food, health, and participation. This Article begins by exploring the causes of childhood obesity focusing on the multiple factors that influence weight, food preferences, and eating patterns in children. The Article proceeds by examining the international human rights law framework for States’ positive obligations to fight obesity among children. It also discusses the child obesity-specific recommendations issued by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, and finally, the Special Rapporteur in the Field of * Professor of Law & Associate Dean for Faculty Scholarship, Golden Gate University School of Law, JSD Stanford Law School, LLM London School of Economics, LLB University of Rome “La Sapienza” (summa cum laude).

They divided China's bilateral investment treaties (\"BITs\") into two generations —conservative and liberal; but actually China has three generations of BITs: the first generations is conservative, the second is liberal, and the third reaches a more balanced approach. They criticized China for not including pre-establishment national treatment in its BITs, not allowing most-favored national clause to extend to procedural issues and not accepting the \"Hull Formula\" in calculating compensation amount for expropriation. These criticisms are untenable, as what proposed is not well-established and widely-accepted practice in the international community.

        "abstract": "This seminar focuses on the relationship between the protection of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and international refugee law, which is the theme of my forthcoming monograph (OUP, 2022).IDPs are persons who have been forced or obliged to leave their places of habitual residence as a result of armed conflict, violence, human rights violations or natural or humanmade disasters, but who have not crossed an international border. IDPs often have similar wants, fears, and needs as refugees. However, unlike refugees, IDPs do not have legal status under international law and there is no specific international (as opposed to regional) treaty that grants them protection. This is despite the fact that there are 40 million IDPs in the world today – outnumbering refugees by around 2:1. Recent decades have nonetheless seen the gradual development of legal and institutional protection of IDPs at international level, such as the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement andregional IDP treaties, the appointment of a UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of IDPs, the extension of the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (‘UNHCR’) to include IDPs, and the creation of ‘safe zones’ within countries oforigin. Although these measures are welcome, some have expressed fears that such activities are in reality about circumventing refugee flows and ‘may be (mis)interpreted as obviating the need for international protection and asylum.’ Indeed, some states have explicitly stated that IDP protection measures are an alternative for asylum. This monograph asks whether such interpretation is legally correct, and explores whether IDP protection complements, conflicts with, or undermines international refugee law. The seminar will first set out the relationship between IDPs and refugees and the history of the IDP protection framework. It will then address the challenges of ensuring that protection of IDPs is not (mis)interpreted as a substitute for asylum. The presentation will conclude by setting out how to effectively manage the challenges in the relationship between IDPs and refugees, by setting out future challenges in this relationship, and by illustrating the overall impact and importance of the findings of the research.

        "abstract": "Africa’s diaspora continues to play an indispensable role in shaping the continent’s social and political landscape. This impact has been felt since the struggle against colonialism to the contemporary challenges of democratisation. Recent developments in technology and the impact of globalisation have further amplified the power of the diasporas to influence events in their home countries. The trend in response by African governments has ranged from exclusion and isolation to cooperation and collaboration. Many African governments have been open to engagement with diasporas to facilitate financial investments, but have been more circumspect in allowing political participation by the diasporas. Can the diasporas play a positive role in facilitating and aiding Africa’s new impetus towards democratisation or will diasporas further fragment some of their already fragile home countries? This article discusses democracy in subSaharan Africa against the backdrop of the peoples’ lived realities, and explores the role of the diasporas in addressing challenges peculiar to the African context. It is argued that diasporas play a significant role in forging the development of democracy in their homelands. The article engages four claims to interrogate this position. First, it contextualises democracy as a reality in Africa. Second, it closely considers the participation by the diasporas. The third aspect involves an evaluation of Africa’s legal and political frameworks, followed by the proposal for a collaborative approach towards the diasporas, to improve democratisation in Africa. As such, the research question that the article seeks to answer is whether the diasporas play a role in forging the development of democracy in Africa.

        "title": "“Endometriosis”: A neuro-etiologic framework for its causes and consequences",
        "abstract": "In recent decades the gynecologic response to “endometriosis” has been to excise, or ablate, its deposits with high rates of recurrent pain. However, there is growing dissatisfaction with surgical outcomes, and, a chorus of clinicians recently called for an improved clinical approach. They want to enhance the use of “clinical” diagnosis to improve “delays in diagnosis”, “bring about more rapid relief ”, “limit disease progression” and “prevent sequelae”. This ambitious agenda is not just a “call to action”; it implies a fundamental shift in approach – though the details of that “shift” were not detailed in the article. In the “autonomic denervation” view of the pathogenesis of “endometriosis”, there are two key pathogenic principles that govern its laparoscopic appearances. Firstly, injuries to uterotubal nerves result in uterotubal dysmotility and retrograde menstruation with, ectopic endometrium deposited in the pelvis. “Difficult”, first labors, straining on the toilet and gynecologic surgery cause the initial pelvic neural injuries. Secondly, ectopic endometrium attaches to anatomic sites of tissue injury e.g. injured uterosacral ligaments, injured peritoneal surfaces, hip replacements, etc if endometrium is available at the time of the injury. Breast feeding mothers do not have \"available\" endometrium. “Endometriosis” with accompanying injuries to pelvic autonomic nerves, may result in a surprisingly wide range of clinical consequences. These include “pain in response to light touch”, sensitization of central nervous system, hyperplasia of the endometrium and myometrium, and, narrowing of adjacent myometrial arterioles resulting in pregnancy complications. Concurrent, or contiguous, injuries at other levels of the sympathetic chain may result in hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, thyroid dysfunction, Sjogren’s syndrome and other “autoimmune” diseases. Re-framing the condition as an injury to pelvic autonomic nerves with widespread, neurologic consequences consequences, may be a more appropriate, clinical framework than attributing such wide-ranging symptoms to isolated deposits of “ectopic endometrium”? *Correspondence to: MJ Quinn, MD, LLM, Dept OBGYN, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, International Peace Maternal and Child Health Hospital, 910 Hengshan Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai, CHINA, PR 200030, E-mail: mjquinn001@ icloud.com XU Hong, MD, Dept OBGYN, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, International Peace Maternal and Child Health Hospital, 910 Hengshan Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai, CHINA, PR 200030, E-mail: xuhong169@126.com Received: August 20, 2019; Accepted: August 28, 2019; Published: August 30, 2019 Introduction What is the primary evidence that ectopic endometrium causes cyclic, premenstrual pain? In Figure 1a there is 1160g of ectopic endometrium in a painless uterus. In Figure 1b there is 260g of ectopic endometrium with intrauterine bleeding from every surface of the specimen – again, in a painless uterus. Yet, we are asked to believe that a single spot of ectopic endometrium is sufficient to confine its nulliparous owner to one week in bed with chronic pelvic pain, every month (Figure 1c)? And, the asymmetric injuries to the uterosacral ligaments are unrelated to the condition (Figure 1d)? In our submission, there is no evidence that ectopic endometrium, of itself, causes cyclic, premenstrual pain. So, what causes pain, bleeding and infertility in 10% of the female population, or, 30-50% of women with pain and infertility [1-3]? In this account, difficult first labours [4], straining on the toilet [5] and gynecologic procedures [6], particularly complications of medical and surgical evacuation, cause injuries to uterotubal nerves (Figure 1, Table 1). These injuries cause uterotubal dysperistalsis with retrograde menstruation of endometrium, with-attaching to sites of tissue injury in the pelvis [7,8]. In his original 1921 account, JA Sampson recorded “increasing constipation” in 3/23 patients with the condition, and, a number had previous difficult deliveries [9]. Indeed, his remarks are entirely consistent with injuries to pelvic nerves causing pelvic neuropathic pain “Twelve of the 17 symptomatic patients sought relief for pain, three for increasing constipation, and one each for uterine bleeding and sterility. The amount of pain and abnormal bleeding were quite variable, and often absent. Sampson concluded: “It is very difficult to decide whether or not these cysts cause profuse or irregular (too frequent) menstruation.” As for pelvic pain, he concluded that “there is usually nothing characteristic about the pain present in this condition nor is there necessarily any relation between the extent of the adhesions and the severity of the pain.” Pathogenesis of chronic, neuropathic, pelvic pain In simple, pathogenetic terms, injuries to uterotubal nerves result in (1) uterotubal dysmotility that results, in turn, in retrograde menstruation with ectopic endometrium (2) attaching to different injuries in the pelvis creating different laparoscopic appearances (or phenotypes (Figure 2) [2-4]. Much of the clinical confusion has resulted from (i) the dichotomous appearances of symmetric and asymmetric appearances of “deep endometriosis” (Figure 2c-d), (ii) the presence of chronic pelvic pain in women without evidence of ectopic endometrium [10]. Such phenotypes may be resolved by a thoughtful surgeon asking “What caused these injuries?” rather than “Where is Bing Xin Y (2019) “Endometriosis”: A neuro-etiologic framework for its causes and consequences Clin Obstet Gynecol Reprod Med, 2019 doi: 10.15761/COGRM.1000262 Volume 5: 2-7 the endometriosis ?”. One key confusion has been the dichotomous, laparoscopic appearances of stage IV, nulliparous “endometriosis” and stage IV, multiparous, “endometriosis”. In the former, the surgeon observes a pelvis full of ectopic endometrium but in the young, nulliparous woman it is almost always caused by straining on the toilet where the uterosacral ligaments are hypertrophic and symmetric, and, the treatment is better diet and and bowel habits [2-4]. In the older, multiparous women the uterosacral ligaments are thin, attenuated and asymmetric because she sustained her injuries during a “difficult” first labor [6]. The extent of the visible, ectopic endometrium may depend on whether she breast-fed (no ectopic endometrium) or she bottle-fed her baby (major ectopic endometrium) [2,3]. Not that we need to perform diagnostic laparoscopy [11] since asking three questions in a thoughtful, precise manner will provide most of the answers to the sources of chronic pelvic pain (Table 1)? Additional ultrasound [12] or MR imaging [13,14] will tell you if there is concurrent adenomyosis and what form that takes (Table 2) since there are distinguishable patterns of adenomyosis and leiomyoma, that are often concurrent with “endometriosis” [15,16]. Injuries to uterotubal nerves result in tubal dysmotility in some forms of infertility that are best dealt with by ART since surgery to endometriomas will reduce ovarian reserve [17]. Endometriomas (-OMA) may be examples of retrograde ectopic endometrium adhering to monthly ovarian “tissue injuries” where ovulatory follicles leave substantial areas of tissue injury that may form OMA-s without any significant contributing neural injuries, beyond that causing the “retrograde menstruation” [18]. They are painless. Extrapelvic “endometriosis” is another matter though the usual sites e.g Caesarean section scar, episiotomy, hip fractures, lung, etc are typically associated with prior injury [18]. In these presentations the pain coincides with the onset of menstruation whereas in pelvic “endometriosis” the pain usually precedes, and then improves, with the Figure 1. Photographs of four phenotypes of endometriosis-adenomyosis. (A) 1160g of painless adenomyosis, (B) 260g of painless adenomyosis, (C) single deposit of endometriosis on the anterior border of the right uterosacral ligament, (D) “deep” endometriosis with large volumes of ectopic endometrium attached to injured uterosacral ligaments containing large numbers of injured uterotubal nerves with extensive neovascularisation of peritoneal surfaces Figure 2.

(In a one-child family, pain starts typically, at 4-5 years postpartum; in a two child family, pain starts typically 7-8 years after first baby) (3) Other gynecologic procedures (a) Have you had any other pregnancies (miscarriages or terminations)?

        "abstract": "The picture is so pervasive in the financial media—the CEOs of two major public corporations announcing the closure of a cross-border mega-merger—that one might be led to believe that securities regulations around the world, which govern the timing at which the information about the merger becomes material, are identical. However, this is an optical illusion that hides existing crucial differences in the determination of what constitutes material information. Although securities regulations tend to be generally harmonized, this Article sheds light on significant differences in the rules governing the definition of what is material information with regard to unfolding future events. Most notably, these rules determine the timing at which information about a potential future event becomes inside information and triggers insider trading prohibitions. In the U.S., the probability/magnitude test has been developed to determine when a developing event becomes material information. In the E.U., a bright line test applies. The different tests imply that the same information can potentially be classified as material at different times depending on the applicable rule. Ultimately, the European regulation is more relaxed and consequently European insiders have the opportunity to trade in corporate securities based on their private information, thereby gaining an unfair advantage over uninformed market players. This Article shows that the interjurisdictional differences create a propensity for undesirable arbitrage and insider trading and undermine cross-border financial investments, as well as optimal corporate * Associate Professor of Law and Vice-Dean at the Haim Striks School of Law, College of ManagementAcademic Studies (Colman); Director of the Heth Center for Competition and Regulation.

        "abstract": "Scientific evidence indisputably demonstrates that lead poisoning causes permanent neurological damage and numerous co-morbidities for children and adults. Exposure to lead hazards irreversibly harms individuals and, left unchecked, can devastate communities into the future. In recognition of these threats, the President's Task Force on Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks to Children (Task Force) was established by Executive Order in 1997. The original Task Force created the first coordinated federal response to eliminate childhood lead poisoning in the United States and set an ambitious ten-year timeline to achieve its goals of prevention, treatment, research, and progress management. However, the most recent Task Force retreated from these bold goals. Rather than eliminating lead poisoning, in 2018 the Task Force sought merely to reduce it. This Article provides a comprehensive overview of the dangers of lead exposure, details the federal government's evolving response to lead poisoning, and, for the first time, disseminates previously unpublished comments on \"Drafting a New Federal Strategy to Reduce Childhood Lead * Emily A.

        "abstract": "Soil quality standards are used as a means to maintain long-term soil productivity and these standards provide threshold values beyond which further alteration of soil properties would significantly change or impair the productivity potential of the soil. Suitability of the soils for a particular crop is an important factor from the productivity point of view. The importance of soil in supporting food crops requires due attention towards study of the chemical composition of soils in relation to crop needs. The study area chosen is Siddapura catchment which is a part of Harangi command area covered in Hassan, Madikeri and Mysore districts, Karnataka state. Geographically it lies between 750 38’ E and 760 15’ E longitude and 120 24’ N and 120 46’ N latitude, covering an area of 1522.4 km2. The study area is covered in Survey of India (SOI) Toposheet numbers 48P/10, 48 P/11, 48 P/14, 48 P/15, 57 D/1, 57 D/2, 57 D/3 on 1:50,000 scale. The maximum length and width of the catchment is approximately equal to 37.53 km and 68.88 km respectively. In the present study, representative soil samples are collected from the field in different locations of the study area and are subjected to chemical analysis to determine the various macronutrients and micronutrients present and fertility status of the soils are determined from the nutrient index criteria. Results shows that based on the nutrient index criteria the soil fertility of Siddapura catchment can be categorized into lowlow-medium (LLM) category with respect to available organic carbon, phosphorous and potassium concentrations.",

        "title": "Reconciling Quasi-States with the Crimes of Aggression Under the ICC Statute",
        "abstract": "On June 11, 2010, a binding definition of the crime of aggression was finally adopted at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in Kampala, Uganda. The adopted definition of the crime of aggression in the Rome Statute reflecting on existing practice leads to the assumption that State-like entities which are lacking universal recognition will not be covered by the Court’s jurisdiction of the crime of aggression. The fact that the term ‘State’ was not clearly defined under the Rome Statute gives the first indication of the implied exclusion of State-like entities from the scope of the crime of aggression. On the other hand, the most recent interpretation of the term “State” as provided by the International Criminal Court (ICC) delivers even more persuasive evidence, reinforcing the argument that these entities would not be covered by this amendment. This Article argues that uncertainty or explicit exclusion of these entities are both illegitimate; based on historical, legal and practical analyses respectively. Consequently, for the purpose of amending this illegitimate situation, the Article will examine how to reconcile these entities with the definition of the crime of aggression. It acknowledges that the explicit inclusion of such entities under the definition alongside States, yet, distinguishable from the latter, is the most favorable solution that better serves the wider objectives of international criminal justice and law. * State Exam (Ludwig Maximillians Universität, Germany), Ass.

        "abstract": "Narrowed, uterine arterioles in the placental bed are the histologic hallmark of many, clinical obstetric syndromes including preeclampsia, IUGR, preterm labor, midtrimester loss, and, placental abruption. Early reports (1945-1980) illustrate, but do not explain, accompanying “halos” of hyalinised cells around these narrowed arterioles that are consistent features of these lesions (Figure 1a). Similar, narrowed arterioles are common in many gynecologic syndromes where there are “halos” of regenerating, injured nerves around narrowed uterine arterioles in presentations of chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis , dyspareunia, vulvodynia, irritative bladder, and, bowel syndromes (Figure 1b). The neurovascular injury is one, and the same, in both obstetric and gynecologic, clinical syndromes. It results from injuries to pelvic vasomotor nerves (the “neural” injury) that release neural cytokines and growth factors causing transmural hyperplasia and narrowing of denervated arterioles, that become susceptible to successive, hyaline and fibrinoid changes (the “vascular” injury). Their common origins have been difficult to recognise because during pregnancy the injured arterioles extend to the placental bed, but, the injured nerves do not, leaving one, or more, layers of hyalinised cells around the injured arteriole in the placental bed biopsy (Figures 1a-b). Injuries to pelvic nerves result from “difficult” first labors, physical efforts during defecation, complications of gynecologic surgical procedures, as well as hypertension. Injuries to arteriolar vasomotor nerves induce “new” and “novel” receptors including purinergic, P2X3 and VEGF receptors in arteriolar smooth muscle that may respond to “pain” and “stretch” , or, activate other autonomic reflexes. Recent evidence suggests that the unexpectedly diverse, and varying, consequences of these neurovascular injuries may contribute to the pathophysiology of different, obstetric and gynaecologic syndromes. *Correspondence to: MJ Quinn, MD, LLM, Visiting Professor, Medical University of Wenzhou, 1, Nanbaixiang Road, Ouhai, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, CHINA, PR 325000, E-mail: mjquinn001@btinternet.com",

        "abstract": "Cultural heritage protection has risen to the forefront of EU politics and policies in recent years, as a response to its intrinsic value and social benefits. Nonetheless, each Member State has its own legal definitions and approaches to cultural heritage protection, corresponding to their respective historical, social, political, and economic contexts. The principle of subsidiarity also entails a substantial amount of delegation, which means that bureaucratic obstacles are added to functional ones (lack of funds, geographical divides, etc.), which can inhibit the free exchange of information and communication. Accordingly, heritage protection is uneven across the EU not only due to varying conceptions of what constitutes heritage, but also as to who is considered an appropriate caretaker or stakeholder, and to what extent they should be involved. The present article provides an overview of the ongoing challenges to cultural heritage preservation and presents recommendations for improvement, from a non-EU citizen’s perspective.

Rather than approach constitutional law as a static structure or imagine the Supreme Court as acting in isolation from society, the book elucidates key constitutional doctrines while also drawing on scholarship in law and political science that connects doctrine to large social changes such as industrialization, social movements such as civil rights and second-wave feminism, and institutional tensions between governmental actors. \n \nCombining legal analysis with historical narrative and sensitivity to political context, the book provides deeper understanding of how constitutional law arises, functions, and changes in a complex, often-divided society.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This research is aimed to analyse the form of legal protection provided for Go-Ride drivers based on partnership agreement. From legal perspective, online-based motorbike ( ojek ) transport is regulated in Regulation of Ministry of Transportation Number 12 of 2019 concerning Safety Protection for Motorbike Users and Public Interests. This research employed normative juridical method with statute and conceptual approaches. The materials for the research comprise primary, secondary, and tertiary data, all of which were collected from documentation and literature, followed by analyses involving systematic and grammatical interpretations. The study shows that the fare is in progress to finalise and this issue has not been resolved yet among the government, applicators, and drivers. It is also revealed that legal measures taken have not fully protected drivers over fare agreement. It is imperative that the government add a new regulation where a representative of online drivers is authorised to set the fare. Therefore, there should be preventive and repressive protection provided for the drivers.

Jenis penelitian ini merupakan penelitian yuridis normatif dengan metode pendekatan peraturan perundang-undangan dan pendekatan konseptual. Bahan hukum yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah bahan hukum primer, sekunder, tersier. Teknik pengumpulan bahan hukum yang digunakan melalui studi dokumentasi dan studi literatur. Analisis bahan hukum yang digunakan oleh penulis adalah interpretasi sistematis dan interpretasi gramatikal. Berdasarkan penelitian ini permasalahan  mengenai tarif yang masih terus difinalisasi belum mencapai titik temu diantara pemerintah, aplikator, dan mitra driver. Dapat disimpulkan bahwa upaya hukum yang sudah diberikan oleh pemerintah terhadap mitra driver belum sepenuhnya melindungi mitra driver terkait kesepakatan tarif . Seharusnya pemerintah menambahkan regulasi dimana mitra driver ojek online mendapatkan perwakilan dalam menentukan tarif, oleh karena itu terdapat dua bentuk perlindungan hukum untuk mitra driver yaitu perlindungan hukum preventif dan perlindungan hukum represif.

        "abstract": "This research argues that Muslim scholars developed two theories of government over time. Even tough Islamic scholars—Shia and Sunni—agree on mandating the highest level of legal knowledge in any member of the Islamic government, they disagree on the legal nature of these members, whether they are judges, or jurists. Shia Islamic scholars adopted the theory of the guardianship of the jurist (Wilayat al-Faqih in Arabic, or Vilayat e-Faqih in Farsi). Unlike Sunni scholars, the Shia has developed a practical approach to apply their theory of government in practice. A prominent example of this theory is the Iranian practice of the Guardianship of the Jurist Theory. Sunni Islamic scholars adopt the theory of government by judiciary (Wilayat Al-Qadi). The assumption of this theory is that member of the government are judges. This is based on the assumption that Prophet Mohamed was a judge with enumerated executive authorities, namely the collection of Sadaqat (state financial revenue), military power, and foreign affairs’ representation. This theory has never been in practice since the assassination of the first four successors of the Prophet. This research is divided into three major sections. The first deals with the theory of Sunni-Muslim scholars, which is government by judiciary. The second section presents the theory of Shia-Muslim scholars, which is guardianship of the jurist. The last section deals with the major five distinctions between the two theories. * Dr. Shams Al Din Al Hajjaji is a visiting professor of Islamic law at University of Antwerp Belgium, and a judge at North Cairo Primary Court, Egypt.

Even tough Islamic scholars—Shia and Sunni—agree on mandating the highest level of legal knowledge in any member of the Islamic government,1 they disagree on the legal nature of these members: whether they are judges or jurists.2 On one hand, Shia scholars adopted the theory of the guardianship of the jurist (Wilayat al-Faqih in Arabic, or Vilayat e-Faqih in Farsi).3 Unlike Sunni scholars, the Shia has developed a practical approach to apply their theory of government in practice.4 A prominent example of this theory is the Iranian practice of the Guardianship of the Jurist Theory.5 On the other hand, Sunni scholars adopt the theory of government by judiciary (Wilayat Al-Qadi).6 Major Sunni scholars like Hasan Al-Basri and Abu Bakr al-Razi adopted such a theory.7 This theory assumes that members of the government are judges.8 This is based on the assumption that Prophet Mohamed was a judge with enumerated executive authorities, “namely the collection of Sadaqat (state financial revenue),9 military power,10 and foreign affairs’ representation.”11 This theory has never been in practice since the assassination of the first four successors of the Prophet.12 1 For Shia, see IMAM KHOMENI, ISLAMIC GOVERNMENT, GOVERNANCE OF THE JURIST (VELAYAT E FAQEEH), 50 (2017); for Sunni, see Ersilia Francesca, The Concept of Sunna in Ibāḍī School, in THE SUNNA AND ITS STATUS IN ISLAMIC LAW: THE SEARCH FOR A SOUND HADITH 105 (Adis Duderija ed., 2015). 2 Khomeni, supra note 1. 3 ISLAHAT VA TAQYYRATI VA TATMIMAH QANUNI ASSASSI [AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION] 1368 [1989], pmbl.

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of customary international law in regulating investments in the mining industry, taking Tanzania’s experience as a case reference. The paper is interested in the issues that should concern African countries like Tanzania, all of which are developing countries. The paper is taken out of the background of development of the international legal framework governing investments, specifically focusing on the framework of customary international law, which has been developing on the platform of controversy, division, disagreement and polarization. However, we also note a transformation from customary international law to treaty law and finally to state-investor agreements which constitute contractual law. However, there is a debate as to whether in this process of transformation, principles of customary international law have adequately transformed into treaty or contractual law, or not, and that if such principles have completely transformed from customary law to treaty or contractual law, then there is no need to fall back to those principles again. In order to answer this question, it appears that the main test to be employed here is that, if there is definitiveness in these principles after their transformation into treaty or contractual law, then the answer is to the affirmative, and if there is still uncertainty in these principles after their transformation, then the answer is in the negative. This paper has found out that there is still uncertainty in these principles after their transformation, which means they have not completely transformed, and which means there will still be need to fall back into customary international law itself instead of having moved to treaty and contractual law completely. The problem is that, falling back to customary international law itself means re-navigating into the waters of controversy, division, disagreement and polarization which are things that seems to have worked negatively against developing countries like Tanzania, and will therefore continue to work in the same way. That means, falling back to customary international law per raises issues and concerns for developing countries like Tanzania. 1 Certificate of Philosophy, LLB, LLM, PhD.

From a theoretical model we derive predictions which we quasi-experimentally investigate, using variation across U.S. local labor markets (LLMs) over the last decades and instrumenting experience supply by the LLMs’ age structures a decade earlier. We find that aging substantially reduces experienced workers’ relative wages and employment rates, and also their labor market participation rates. Our results imply that the effect of demographic change on labor markets might be more severe than previously recognized, as it reaches beyond wages. JEL classification: J11, J21, J31",

        "abstract": "This essay (written in honor of the 10th Anniversary of the Centre for Transnational Legal Studies in London (Georgetown), and for several conferences on the globalization of legal education, describes the growth of “transnational legal education” in many forms: domestic comparative and international law, study abroad programs of various kinds, the integration (in some schools) of foreign LLMs into the full curriculum, and the author’s experience in teaching in over 25 different countries in internationalized legal studies and law programs and courses. True “transnational” or “globalized” legal education, in my view, requires full immersion in the legal culture and contexts being studied, not simply traditional forms of legal education. The essay describes a variety of experiential, as well as traditional, courses of comparative, domestic and international law, undertaken in multi-cultural settings where some diversity of teaching method, faculty and students is achieved. The ideal goals of such courses are for students (and faculty) to undertake rigorous study of legal pluralism at all levels (international, domestic, supranational and sub-national) and to understand that most law is “chosen,” not mandated or given. True transnational legal education must be socio-legal, multi-cultural, contextual, and also use multiple methods of instruction. Examples of such educational efforts in some different contexts are provided. How we evaluate the success or impact of such programs at achieving their goals remains understudied.",

        "title": "How Can Human Rights Activism Help Tackle Economic Inequality? Lessons from Mining Affected Communities in South Africa",
        "abstract": "The dramatic rise in socioeconomic inequality produced by neoliberal globalisation has provoked a crisis of confidence in the human rights community and inspired a wave of debate about whether human rights have anything meaningful to offer in advancing economic justice. The pessimistic view argues human rights are inadequate for challenging socioeconomic inequality because they are too closely aligned to Western liberalism and too uncritical of the rise of capitalism. The more optimistic view does not dismiss these critiques entirely. It argues that they are only valid for particular (arguably dominant) types of human rights praxis, however. Failing to acknowledge this reproduces Global North bias and stunts our ability to learn from the diverse ways grassroots groups and social movements mobilise human rights “promiscuously”, as Amy Kapczynski puts it, in order to build power locally. Nevertheless, academic literature exploring the political economy of human rights praxis in the Global South remains relatively thin and is largely literature-based. To contribute to this literature, as well as to pragmatic debates about how the human rights community can better address the challenge of economic inequality, this paper investigates this praxis in greater depth. It is based on qualitative community-based research with social movement activists from mining affected communities in South Africa. South Africa provides an insightful context for examining how social movements leverage human rights discourse in their struggles for economic justice. On the one hand, South Africa has some of the world’s strongest protections for socioeconomic rights. On the other, it remains one of the most unequal countries in the world. To gain a deeper understanding of this paradox, the paper explores how activists conceptualise inequality and the role of economic power in shaping it; the discourses they draw on; and the forms of political expression they employ to contest economic power.

        "title": "Resistance Training with and Without Blood Flow Restriction to Repetition Failure: More Pain, Same Gain",
        "abstract": "Evidence suggests blood flow restricted (BFR) resistance training performed with low-loads (20-40% 1-repetition maximum; 1-RM) is superior to low-load training when volume (load x repetitions) is matched. Since it has been shown using traditional resistance training that similar gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy occur between highand low-load training when performed to repetition failure, it is of interest if this also occurs with low-load training with/without BFR. Moreover, the perception of pain at repetition failure between protocols and over time has not been examined in a training setting. PURPOSE: To determine if low-load resistance training to repetition failure with/without BFR elicits similar muscular strength, hypertrophy and perceived pain. METHODS: Seven young (25±1 yr) males were recruited to perform single-leg Smith-machine squats 3 d/wk for 6 wk. Each leg was randomly assigned to perform 30% 1-RM with (BFR) or without BFR (RT) for 3 sets to repetition failure with 100s of rest after each set. Tourniquet pressure was set at 60-70% of the lowest occlusive pressure and remained inflated throughout the 3 sets. Leg strength (1-RM), muscle hypertrophy (leg lean mass; LLM) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and ultrasound derived vastus lateralis (VL) muscle thickness (MT), were measured before and after the 6-weeks. A visual analog scale (1000 point) was used to assess pain after each set and rest period for the 1st, 4th, 8th, 11th and 15th training session. RESULTS: 1-RM increased similarly in both groups after training (BFR 79±13 to 95±13 kg vs. RT 82±13 to 100±13 kg, p<0.002) and VL MT (BFR: 2.69±0.08 to 2.98±0.1 vs. RT: 2.75±0.16 to 2.96±0.1 cm, p<0.016) with non-significant changes in LLM (BFR 7.29±0.38 to 7.40±0.39 vs. RT 7.28±0.37 to 7.34±0.36 kg, p<0.243). There was an increase in perceived pain with BFR training compared to the RT group across all sessions following the first rest period (BFR: 288±25 vs. RT: 155±9 a.u., p<0.05) and second rest period (BFR: 433±31 vs. RT:160±9 a.u., p<0.05). While there was a trend for a decrease in pain over time with repeated training, this effect was non-significant. CONCLUSIONS: When performed to failure, low-load training with and without BFR have similar muscle strength and hypertrophy despite differences in perceived pain. Supported by NSERC, CFI and ERA",

        "title": "Service of process via social media : exploring the use of social media platforms to provide notice to defendants in civil cases in Belgium",
        "abstract": "In common law systems, there has recently been a trend to permit plaintiffs to serve process on defendants through social media networks. This trend raises the following question: Is this form of service also beneficial in civil law countries—in particular, Belgium? To answer this question, this Article analyzes the conditions under which this type of service has been allowed by US courts, where most of the new development has occurred. This Article concludes that social media service may be a valuable additional means of notice when the defendant does not have a known address. In such circumstances, Belgian law currently prescribes service on the public prosecutor as the method of last resort; however, service via social media platforms is far more effective at actually reaching the defendant. Consequently, the Belgian legislature could consider introducing social media service as a method supplementing service on the public prosecutor, provided the necessary safeguards are implemented. * Cedric Vanleenhove (PhD Ghent University; LLM Cambridge) is a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Law and Criminology of Ghent University (Transnational Law Center of the Department of Interdisciplinary Study of Law, Private Law and Business Law) and professor at the HEC Management School of the University of Liège in Belgium.

I studied Equity, in part, under Professor Lee and he was a prominent member of the teaching community at my University College. \nAt that time, and later, I came to appreciate the extent to which his reputation was established, not just in Australia, but throughout the common law world. Perhaps the most telling of a number of indications, once publications such as the masterful Ford & Lee are put to one side, is the fact that when Donovan Waters QC, former Oxford don, STEP Honorary Member and one of the negotiators of the Hague Trust Convention,[1] visited Australia as a guest of STEP, the one Australian he specifically asked us to arrange for him to meet was Tony Lee.  \nSo to give this lecture before an audience including Tony Lee, fills me with not a little trepidation. He – and no doubt many others of you – will be immediately aware of any errors or imperfections.  It is small consolation that, on this occasion at least, he will not be marking the paper.  \nIn choosing the topic for the paper, I had in mind a paper given by the Hon Dyson Heydon, AC QC, to the first STEP Australia Conference.[2]  Mr Heydon QC observed that: \nThis paper is an edited version of a paper presented at the 2018 WA Lee Equity Lecture delivered on 21 November 2018 at the Banco Court, Supreme Court of Queensland, Brisbane. \n* AM RFD QC; BA (UQ), LLB (UQ), LLM (UQ). \n[1] Adopted by Australia and implemented in the Trusts (Hague Convention) Act 1991 (Cth). \n[2] JD Heydon, ‘Modern Fiduciary Liability: the Sick Man of Equity’ (2014) 20 Trusts & Trustees 1006.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To analyze and compare the power of lower limbs and cardiorespiratory capacity in football and volleyball athletes of the Sub-14 and Sub-15 categories during a competitive period in a club in the city of Ipatinga-MG, (besides verifying if the variables meet the standards proposed for health in the literature). Methods: The data collection was carried out in 4 days, during the training schedules of the sports modalities. On the first day, the questionnaire was filled in. On the second day, anthropometric assessments (weight and height), percentage of fat (% G), on the third day, the Test Counter Moviment Jump (CMJ) was administered to the MMII and on the fourth and last day the Yo-Yo Test was applied to evaluate the cardiorespiratory capacity. All the volunteers signed a consent form, followed by the signature of the parents or guardians. The present study was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the University Center of the East of Minas Gerais. Results: A statistically significant difference (p <0.05) was found for the cardiorespiratory aptitude variable among football athletes for volleyball athletes [54.25 ± 2.66 vs 49.42 ± 3.77 *], different for the power of lower limbs where no statistically significant difference (p <0.05) was found for the modalities [48.50 ± 6.49 vs 51.93 ± 5.37]. Conclusion: It was observed that there was a statistically significant difference among football athletes for volleyball in the variable cardiorespiratory capacity, however in the power of MMII the values found did not present significant difference between the modalities. Regarding the health standards proposed in the literature for the cardiorespiratory capacity variable, football athletes are classified as good, while volleyball athletes presented values considered to be bad. Analyzing the reference standards suggested by the literature, the power of LLM in both modalities obtained values considered normal for health. We suggest that more studies be carried out in order to compare different modalities, supporting more conclusively the results presented in this study.",

Ukuhlola is still practiced in some of the communities in South Africa, in particular Nguni communities. Ukuhlola culture originated from Zulu culture and is prevalent mostly in KwaZulu-Natal Province. The motive was to receive the full lobola (the eleventh cow). Ukuhlola practice faced out during the past century, but has made a come back in various areas of South Africa including Kwazulu-Natal in recent years.

        "abstract": "Abstract: As a response to the growing global prominence of indigenous rights and the right of every person to know the laws that regulate the person’s conduct and activities, this article examines how adequate public access to the unwritten rules of indigenous customary law can be achieved in such a way that the method of providing that access also complies with the general human rights, e.g. the right to a fair trial, and the specific rights of indigenous communities. The theory of legal certainty provided the theoretical framework for this article, an aspect of which is the concept of ascertainment of indigenous customary law. The other specific relevant concepts are the rule of law and the doctrine of ignorance of the law is no excuse. The United Nations-endorsed human rights-based approach (HRBA) provided the conceptual framework for analysing the human-rights requirements of the model ascertainment method, while the specific requirements for adequate public access to indigenous customary law were formulated from existing literature. The findings of the study include the following: There are four existing methods of ascertainment of unwritten indigenous customary law, namely judicialization, codification, restatement, and self-statement; and those methods neither provide adequate public access to indigenous customary law nor protect the human rights and indigenous rights of the communities affected by the ascertainment of their law. To provide an alternative to the existing deficient methods of ascertainment, this article develops the human rights-compliant and public access-adequate model of ascertainment of indigenous customary law, acronymed huricompatisation, as a new ascertainment method. Huricompatisation incorporates a mix of twelve relevant general human rights and specific indigenous rights into ten essential requirements for adequate public access to indigenous customary law. This article argues that huricompatisation satisfies the need of the members of indigenous communities to know the applicable rules of their indigenous customary law and that it preserves the evolving and adaptive nature of that law. Further, huricompatisation protects their general human rights and their specific indigenous rights, including their omnibus right to self-determination that encompasses their right to self-governance in their internal affairs, as well as their rights to their culture and indigenous identity. Additionally, huricompatisation provides the opportunity for unprecedented free public access to indigenous customary law from communities worldwide. The United Nations, regional bodies, governments at all levels, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations, other policymakers who work on indigenous matters, and indigenous communities will benefit from the law-reform utility and policy relevance of this article that extends the frontiers of the right of free access to public legal information to indigenous customary law globally.

        "title": "DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF METHAMPHETAMINE ANALYSIS METHODS IN DRIED BLOOD SPOT SAMPLE USING GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY – MASS SPECTROMETRY",
        "abstract": "Methamphetamine or known as sabu is one of the amphetamine groups that give a very strong central nervous system stimulant effect. Nowadays, the method used to test the specimens to prove a person who had methamphetamine, for example is urine and blood. This research was aimed to develop methamphetamine analysis method in Dried Blood Spot (DBS). This research used non-invasive bio sampling method namely DBS using Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) because it is suitable for compounds that are stable to high temperatures and present in small levels in the body. This research started from optimization of gas chromatography condition optimization mass spectrometry, optimization of sample preparation method from DBS, until validation of bio analysis method. The optimum chromatographic conditions were MS-5 capillary DB columns with a length of 30 m; 0.25 mm inner diameter; Helium gas phase 99.999%; 1.0 mL / min flow rate; detection of MS at m / z value 58.00; 91.00; and 77,00 with ephedrine HCl as an internal standard. Sample preparation using liquid-liquid micro-extraction method (LLM) using methanol solvent then residue dried under the flow of N2 gas and reconstituted with 50 μL ethyl acetate. The method obtained was linear in the concentration range 1.750 – 35.000 ng / mL with r > 0.9800. (y = -0.0001 + 0.0004x withr = 0.9987). The validation results of the methamphetamine analysis method performed met the validation requirements based on the EMEA Bio analytical Guideline of 2011. This method can be applied in the detection and analysis of amphetamine in drug abuse.",

        "title": "Nuclear Power Plants and Terror Attacks in Japan",
        "abstract": "The operation of several Japanese nuclear power plants will be halted because the Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NRA) reported that these nuclear power plants are not sufficiently prepared for potential terror attacks. It is unclear how the Japanese judiciary will exercise judicial review of this NRA decision regarding terror attack protection measures. Japanese courts have previously avoided review of the constitutionality of defense and peace statutes by citing the political question doctrine. The attitude of the Japanese judiciary toward national defense is symbolic as seen in several cases concerning Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, the pacifism provision that renounces war as a means to settle international disputes involving the State. Japanese administrative agencies are authorized to exercise discretion within the scope of power vested in them by the statutes passed in the parliament, or Diet. Under the Administrative Case Litigation Act (ACLA), which was revised in 2004, Japanese courts can review potential unlawful use of government authority under several principles such as fact-finding, purpose, timing, equal principles, constitutional rights infringement, and unconstitutional motives. The judiciary has reviewed administrative agencies’ decision under ACLA in nuclear power plant cases. Under ACLA, Japanese courts can review if the administrative discretion of administrative agencies is arbitrary and capricious, but not their political validity and policy judgment capability. The judiciary may defer to administrative agency decisions in light of their expertise. In any review of administrative discretion, the court may take the position of the administrative agency to review the latter’s disposition. In other cases, the court may respect the agency’s disposition and review only the procedure. Citizens may take action against administrative agencies by challenging the validity of their decisions under the Administrative Complaint Review Act (ACRA). The ACRA provides an avenue that is simpler than the ACLA and yields a more rapid response, but it is not as fair as the ACLA because agencies themselves conduct an internal review of the validity of their decisions. In the famous Ikata nuclear power plant case of 1992, the Japanese Supreme Court deferred to the administrative agency decision for its expertise, but did not use the term “discretion(sairyō)”. This may be because nuclear power plants come under the purview of national energy policy, thus affecting Japan as a whole. This paper argues that the judiciary may identify unconstitutional motives, but does not thoroughly review the public records and the reasoning behind administrative decisions. The Japanese court system has not yet reviewed the NRA decision to halt nuclear power plant operations due to possible terror attacks. The statute on terror attacks was passed soon after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. Terror attacks may provide an avenue for the Japanese judiciary to avoid strict judicial review of the administrative agency’s decision. It is unclear whether the Japanese judiciary will carefully examine the safety countermeasures against terror attacks, defer to the NRA by citing the agency’s expertise, or offer excuses on the grounds of national security and defense, which is stipulated in Article 9. This paper argues that national defense and nuclear power plant safety in the event of natural disasters have both commonalities and differences. Japanese administrative law scholars must analyze the expertise of the administrative agency in deference to the Japanese judiciary. 1 Yuichiro Tsuji, associate professor at Meiji university law school.

        "title": "Fuzzy Modeling using Neural Gas",
        "abstract": "—Fuzzy modeling has been extensively studied. Among them, it has been shown that fuzzy modeling methods using vector quantization (VQ) and steepest descent method (SDM) are effective in terms of the number of rules (parameters). The methods ﬁrstly determine the initial parameter values of fuzzy rules by using VQ with learning data, and then tune the parameters by using SDM. On the other hand, Neural Gas (NG) is known as a novel approach of VQ and NG with local linear mappings (LLMs) has been applied to a time-series prediction problem. In the application, the predicted value in each of subregions is approximated by using a corresponding linear mapping. It has been demonstrated that, compared with K-means with RBF, NG with LLMs is advantageous in terms of the accuracy and the number of subregions. The idea of NG with LLMs has been applied to fuzzy modeling with TS fuzzy model, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. However, the effectiveness of this approach has not been been conﬁrmed for simpler fuzzy model such as simpliﬁed fuzzy model. This paper proposes to apply the concept of NG with LLMs to fuzzy modeling with simpliﬁed fuzzy inference model. The proposed method ﬁrstly determines the initial parameter values of fuzzy rules including the weights in the consequent part by using NG and supervised learning, and then tunes the parameters by using SDM. The effectiveness of the proposed method with sim-pliﬁed fuzzy modeling is demonstrated in numerical simulations of function approximation and classiﬁcation problems.",

        "abstract": "The conventional methodology for sentiment analysis within large language models (LLMs) has predominantly drawn upon human emotional frameworks, incorporating physiological cues that are inherently absent in text-only communication. This research proposes a paradigm shift towards an emotionally-agnostic approach to sentiment analysis in LLMs, which concentrates on purely textual expressions of sentiment, circumventing the confounding effects of human physiological responses. The aim is to refine sentiment analysis algorithms to discern and generate emotionally congruent responses strictly from text-based cues. This study presents a comprehensive framework for an emotionally-agnostic sentiment analysis model that systematically excludes physiological indicators whilst maintaining the analytical depth required for accurate emotion detection. A novel suite of metrics tailored to this approach is developed, facilitating a nuanced interpretation of sentiment within text data, which is paramount for enhancing user interaction across a spectrum of text mining applications, including recommendation systems and interactive AI characters. The research undertakes a critical comparative analysis, juxtaposing the newly proposed model with traditional sentiment analysis techniques, to evaluate efficacy enhancements and to substantiate its application potential. Further, the investigation delves into the short-term memory capabilities of LLMs, exploring the implications for character AI roleplaying interfaces and their ability to recall and respond to user input within a text-driven emotional framework. Findings indicate that this emotionally-agnostic sentiment analysis approach not only simplifies the sentiment assessment process within LLMs but also opens avenues for a more precise and contextually appropriate emotional response generation. This abstracted model, devoid of human physiological constraints, represents a significant advancement in text mining, fostering improved interactions and contributing to the evolution of LLMs as adept analytical tools in various domains where emotional intelligence is crucial.",

        "title": "Efficient wall modeling for large eddy simulations of general non-equilibrium wall-bounded flows",
        "abstract": "The main purpose of this thesis has been to contribute to the development of methodologies for wall modeling Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of wall-bounded flows, especially those at high Reynolds numbers. This flow configuration is widely found in a vast range of industrial applications. Unfortunately, given the physical nature of boundary layers, their accurate numerical resolution can be computationally unaffordable. Wall modeling aims at reproducing the inner layer effects on the flow without resolving it explicitly. This allows performing accurate numerical simulations of high Reynolds number wall-bounded flows at a fraction of the cost that would be incurred if the inner layer was temporally and spatially resolved. \nThis work comprises six chapters. The first one is an introduction to the existing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches, from the most accurate and general methodologies to the most simplified and specific techniques. \nThe second chapter introduces relevant physical magnitudes to be analyzed to ensure the reliability of a given high fidelity CFD simulation. Spatial and temporal aspects, both crucial for a correct and accurate resolution of a turbulent flow, are considered. \nIn the third chapter, a Two-Layer wall shear stress model (TLM) for LES and suitable for non-equilibrium flows and complex geometries is presented. Wall shear stress models in general, and RANS-based wall models (WM) in particular, are affected by the \"log-layer mismatch\" (LLM) and the resolved Reynolds stresses (RRS) inflow problems which undermine the quality of the WM numerical predictions. The model presented in this work features a temporal filter in the WM/LES interface which allows solving both problems at once with a single and low-computational-cost step. Until now, these two problems have been dealt with separately with different techniques, which in some cases were complex and computationally expensive. \nOn the other hand, a methodology intended to determine the optimal temporal filter length is proposed and validated in equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions. This new technique is based on the velocity power spectrum which reveals the flow characteristic time-scales in the near-wall region. According to the results obtained in the validation tests, it is concluded that for RANS-based TLM methods, time-resolved frequencies higher than the energy-containing/inertial range limit must be filtered. In chapter four, the mathematical model of the TLM, based on the URANS equations, is presented. Moreover, its numerical resolution through the finite volume method is developed and finally summarized in a flow-chart. \nThen, in chapter five, the algorithmic implementation of the numerical model described in chapter four is presented. The TLM is a fully operational and independent CFD solver based on the URANS equations, which has been developed from scratch. Given that the primary objective of wall modeling is reducing the computational costs, an efficient algorithmic and parallel implementation is a key aspect of the global modeling strategy. Thus, the parallel efficiency is evaluated through a strong scalability test. Good results are obtained although some aspects to be improved are identified. \nFinally, in the last chapter, general conclusions concerning the whole work are given together with future research proposals aimed at going further in the methodologies studied in this thesis.\n El principal objectiu d’aquesta tesi ha estat contribuir al desenvolupament de metodologies relacionades amb wall modeling aplicat a Large Eddy Simulations (LES) de fluxos de paret, especialment per a números de Reynolds alts. Aquesta configuració de flux es troba en un ampli número d’aplicacions industrials. Tot i això, donada la naturalesa de les capes límit, la resolució numèrica acurada d’aquest tipus de flux de manera rutinària és inviable. La tècnica de wall modeling pretén reproduir els efectes de la capa límit interna sense necessitat de resoldre-la explícitament. Això permet la resolució de fluxos de paret a alts números de Reynolds amb una fracció del cost que tindria si la capa límit interna fos resolta tant des d’un punt de vista espacial com temporal. Aquest treball està format per sis capítols. El primer és una introducció a la dinàmica de fluids computacional (CFD en les seves sigles en anglès), des de les metodologies més acurades i generals, fins a les tècniques més específiques i simplificades. Al segon capítol s’introdueixen les magnituds físiques rellevants que s’han d’analitzar per a avaluar i confirmar la fiabilitat d’una determinada simulació numèrica CFD d’alta fidelitat. Es consideren tant els aspectes espacials com temporals, els quals són fonamentals per a la correcta resolució d’un flux turbulent. Al tercer capítol es presenta un model de paret Two-Layer per a fluxos de no-equilibri i geometries complexes. Els models wall shear stress en general i els models basats en RANS en particular, estan afectats per els problemes de “log-layer mismatch” i “resolved Reynolds stresses inflow”, que deterioren la qualitat de les prediccions numèriques. El model proposat incorpora un filtre temporal a la interfície entre el model de paret i el domini LES, el qual suprimeix els dos errors comentats prèviament amb un sol pas de baix cost computacional. Fins ara, la eliminació d’aquests dos errors es duia a terme amb tècniques separades que en alguns casos eren complexes i costoses des d’un punt de vista computacional. A més a més, es proposa una metodologia per a la determinació de la longitud de filtre temporal òptima, la qual és validada tant en condicions d’equilibri com de no-equilibri. La nova tècnica està basada en l’obtenció de l’espectre de freqüències de la velocitat, el qual revela les característiques de les escales temporals del flux en la regió propera a la paret. Segons els resultats obtinguts en els tests, es conclou que per als models Two-Layer basats en RANS, les freqüències més altes que el límit entre el rangs energy-containing i inercial, s’han de filtrar. En el capítol quatre es presenta el model matemàtic del Two-Layer model basat en les equacions URANS. A més a més, es detalla la metodologia numèrica utilitzada per a la seva resolució a través del mètode dels volums finits. Al capítol cinc es presenta la implementació del model numèric presentat al capítol quatre. El model desenvolupat en aquesta tesi és un solver de CFD complert basat en les equacions URANS. Donat que el principal objectiu del wall modeling és la reducció de costos computacionals, és necessària una implementació eficient del model. És per això que la eficiència paral·lela del codi implementat s’analitza a través d’un strong scalability test. En aquestes proves es determina el bon comportament del codi, encara que s’identifiquen punts en els que es pot optimitzar la implementació actual. Finalment, a l’últim capítol es presenten les conclusions generals del treball. A més a més, s’hi inclouen un seguit de propostes sobre futures línies de recerca dirigides aprofundir en les conclusions obtingudes durant la realització del present estudi.",

        "abstract": "This Article hypothesizes on the reasons behind India’s Declaration to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) Article 5(a) as a manifestation of the intensive compliance deadlock over its due diligence obligation which castigates traditional, cultural attitudes as responsible for gender-based violence. A qualitative analysis of two historical moments when India was confronted with an empirical conflict of the CEDAW’s due diligence obligation: the sati of Roop Kanwar in 1987 and the Shah Bano judgment in 1985, even prior to its CEDAW accession in 1993 is undertaken, to argue that the rational choice theory of voting and elections perfectly explains non-compliance. This article contests the position that norms are epiphenomenal and makes the case that only a study of gendered compliance alters the epistemological lens. This finding implies norms could be rationally restructured to make it in nations’ interest to comply, simultaneously contesting the post-positivist feminist IR contention that eschews the relevance of the mainstream discipline. ∗ Shritha Vasudevan is currently a graduate student in the Department of Political Science at the University of Florida, Gainesville, United States.

        "abstract": "This Article analyzes the concurrent expert evidence model (“hot tubbing”) which has been most strongly promoted in Australia and is increasingly becoming a normalized procedure in other international jurisdictions. The Article asks whether, and to what extent, the model has a useful role to play in toxic harms cases in the U.S. and in civil cases more generally? It answers this question by arguing that concurrent evidence certainly does have a useful role to play in the U.S., for all of the reasons that the model has become a preferred process in Australia. Principally, these reasons are that the model serves to enhance the efficiency and quality of the evidence taking process. The first Part of the Article traverses concurrent evidence’s jurisprudential backdrop in Australia, expanding on two useful cases in which the model’s benefits have been on display, one being a major toxics case (and Australia’s largest ever class action), and the other being a case from another area of complex litigation in which hot tubbing is now a standard process, native title.

The Article also argues that use of hot tubbing in the U.S. is consistent with the letter and spirit of the federal rules of evidence and procedure, but it would be preferable to clarify the acceptability of the process through the adoption of suitable legislative amendments.

        "title": "A Right to Universal Health Coverage in Resource-Constrained Nations? Towards a Blueprint for Better Health Outcomes",
        "abstract": "Universal health coverage, as conceived by the World Health Organization (WHO) and adopted in the programmatic framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is a clarion call for states to strengthen their health financing systems to avoid catastrophic and impoverishing health spending. However, the framing of the goals of universal health coverage fails to take account of underlying determinants of health and appears to abandon decades of health rights scholarship and jurisprudence. This scholarship and jurisprudence, although not entirely free from disagreements and shortcomings, is argued to offer a better framework for universal health coverage when strengthened with the paradigm of legal positions developed by Robert Alexy. Informed by the need to bolster universal health coverage to ensure better health outcomes in resource-constrained nations such as Brazil, India, Nigeria and South Africa, this paper argues for a strengthening of the framework of the right to health and its convergence with universal health coverage to achieve better health outcomes in resource-constrained nations. I. IN THIS PAPER, I advance the claim that if the “right to health”, understood as a set of “legal positions” to universal health coverage, is implemented in resource-constrained nations, better health outcomes are likely to result. The means I suggest for the implementation of the right is by engaging the tripartite framework of legal positions developed by Robert Alexy to clarify the beneficiaries, subject matter and addressees of the right to health. Alexy’s idea bolsters the current framing of universal health coverage, linking it with the underlying determinants of health; and seeking a convergence of the right to health and universal health coverage to inform the attainment of better health outcomes in resource-constrained nations. The better health outcomes I envisage include significant reductions in the mortality rates, morbidity ratio and communicable and noncommunicable diseases, and improvements in the underlying determinants of health. By putting forward these arguments, I invariably suggest that the current framing of the right to health in international law, and the domestic system of many resource-constrained nations, is inadequate to bring about the attainment of better health outcomes in those states. I further suggest that universal health coverage, as currently framed by the World Health Organization,  Sessional Lecturer, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; LLB (Jos), BL, LLM (Lagos), PhD (Sydney). 2 THE TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEW [ VOL 5] WHO, and in the programmatic framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is too narrowly focused on clinical outcomes to the detriment of the underlying determinants of health which play a significant role in securing the better health outcomes that I advocate in this paper. In Part II, I clarify three concepts germane to the paper, namely, “the right to health”, “universal health coverage” and “resource-constrained nations”. In Part III, I examine Alexy’s concept of legal positions and suggest ways in which his tripartite paradigm of beneficiaries, subject-matter, and addressees can strengthen the right to health. I focus specifically on the constitutional context of India and Nigeria, where the right has been weakly framed vis-à-vis Brazil and South Africa where the right is strongly framed. I then return to the discussion on universal health coverage in Part IV where I point out the problem with its current framing. I suggest ways it can be strengthened by integrating underlying determinants of health into its framework. I also make a case for its convergence with the right to health to bring about better health outcomes. In Part V, I offer, by way of conclusion, a summary of the main claims advanced. II. THE RIGHT TO HEALTH, UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE AND RESOURCECONSTRAINED NATIONS : SOME PERTINENT CLARIFICATIONS A. THE RIGHT TO HEALTH More than 70 years since the emergence of the “right to health” in international human rights thought and action, there remains significant disagreement about what the right means, its content and the best way to bring about its fulfilment. These disagreements have largely hindered the effective deployment of the right in international law and in many domestic legal systems. It is for this reason that I suggest that the framework of the right to health needs to be first strengthened by recasting it as a set of legal positions so as to properly clarify the nature of the obligations which claims about the right to health implicate. Thereafter, I advocate for the convergence of this 1 See Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, GA Res 70/1, UNGAOR, 17th Sess, Supp No 49 (2015) 3; World Health Organization, Health in 2015: From MDGs, Millennium Development Goals to SDGs, Sustainable Development Goals (Geneva: WHO Press, 2015). 2 The preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization 1946 (WHO) was the first international legal instrument to expressly provide for the right to health. Since then, it has been codified in several other international instruments (such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966) and has informed international human rights praxis in the area of health, internationally and domestically. See Constitution of the World Health Organization, 22 July 1946, WHA51.23 (entered into force on 7 April 1948) (WHO Constitution 1946). RIGHT TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH COVERAGE revitalized paradigm of the right to health with universal health coverage in order to achieve better health outcomes in resource-constrained nations. Scholarly debate about the meaning of the right to health stem from disagreements about the way health has been defined in the preamble of WHO Constitution as “...a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. The principal objection to this formulation of the right is that the inclusion of “social well-being” in the definition of health has turned “the enduring problem of human happiness into one more medical problem to be dealt with by scientific means.” Another objection to WHO conception of the right is that it “obscures some relevant moral distinctions that need to be taken seriously in the process of specifying rights and duties regarding the right to health.” Although General Comment No. 14 of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural (CESCR) has largely addressed some of these objections, questions remain on mapping out the exact contours of the right. The complication about what should rightly be canvassed in claims about the right to health is exacerbated by the precatory formulation of the right in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ICESCR. This is in contrast to the dogmatic formulation of counterpart rights in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR. In many resource-constrained nations where the right to health has been incorporated into the national constitution (Nigeria and India inclusive), the framing of the right has been followed by constitutional provisions that exclude the justiciability of the right. Some resource-constrained nations, such as India, have found a way around non-justiciable constitutional provisions on health 3 Ibid.

Rather it suggests a claim as to availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health goods and services. See Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, General Comment No 14: The Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health (Art. 12), 22nd Sess, Un Doc E/C.12/2000/4 (11 August 2000) at paras 8 and 12.

Others, such as Nigeria, have largely refrained from doing so, adopting instead an attitude of ambivalence towards the right. I explain this phenomenon (elsewhere) as stemming from the fact that the human rights norm on health that the constitutional framework of Nigeria has radiated does not demonstrate a sufficient level of commitment to the right. As such, the Nigerian populace have not been well positioned to secure for themselves sufficient guarantees of enforceability of the right to health. The difference between Nigeria and India is that while the apex court of the former has been largely timid in expounding the jurisprudence on socio-economic rights, the apex court of the latter has adopted an activists stance that has resulted in a paradigm shift in how the right to health (and other socio-economic rights) are regarded. On this basis, it is possible to hold the view that health rights litigation is perhaps an effective strategy for overcoming the shortcomings of ",

        "title": "An Empirical Study: The Missing Hyperlink—Can Canadian Laws Effectively Protect Consumer Purchasing Online?",
        "abstract": "Canadian consumer protection legislation applicable to online transactions generally works by a two-pronged method: first, private international law rules ensure that in most cases, consumers can sue in their home province under that province’s law; and, second, a wide range of substantive obligations are imposed on merchants, and failure to comply with these obligations provides consumers with a right of cancellation. This study considers the private international law rules applicable to online consumer contracts, and discusses the unique jurisdictional challenges presented by online transactions. This study also provides an overview of Canadian legislation applicable to online consumer transactions, and examines the provisions of the Internet Sales Contract Harmonization Template that were incorporated into the consumer protection legislation of several provinces. Given that there is little to no hard data on whether current consumer protection is actually effective in protecting consumers, an empirical study was designed to assess the limits of current legislation and offer recommendations to improve e-businesses and online consumers’ experience. The study’s main finding is that not a single business complied fully with its legal obligations. This suggests that in order for Canadian consumer protection law to have a significant impact on e-businesses’ practices, substantive obligations imposed by the legislation must be combined with a more effective coercive mechanism. State intervention is required to reshape legislation and ensure the protection of consumers’ basic rights. * LLL (Ottawa), JD (Ottawa), LLM (Queen’s); currently serving as a law clerk at the SupremeCourt ofCanada, andas an adjunct professor at theUniversity ofOttawa (Civil Law Faculty).

        "title": "A Failed Attempt to Protect Hedge Fund Investors? An Inquiry into the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive",
        "abstract": "Historically, hedge funds operated in a ‘legislative vacuum’, i.e., they were structured in such a way so as to avoid falling within the scope of any regulatory perimeter. Hedge funds were designed as an exception to the rules, usually applicable to retail investment funds. This was achieved by offering their units to professional investors only, who were deemed to possess necessary skills and investment experience to protect their own interests, without the need for any additional legislative interference. The last financial crisis, in 2007-08, has shown the weaknesses of this approach. The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive of 2011 is the first pan-European attempt to regulate the hedge fund industry. It aims to create an internal market for hedge fund managers, prevent systemic risks and protect fund investors. This paper discusses the duties of a hedge fund manager—conduct of business rules—set forth in the Directive as a mechanism to protect investors. These duties form part of the regulatory law, i.e., they establish a relationship between a hedge fund manager and a national regulatory authority. The breach of hedge fund manager’s duties does not give a private right of action, meaning neither a fund nor its investors can bring a claim directly against a hedge fund manager. These breaches are actionable by a national regulatory authority and lead to administrative sanctions. This paper analyzes the interrelationship between regulatory law and private law related to hedge fund manager’s duties in the United Kingdom, France, and Luxembourg. It argues that the mechanisms of private law— agency and contract law—are better suited to protect interests of hedge fund † Mariia Domina Repiquet holds an LLM International Business Law (University of Manchester, the UK) and MSC International Finance (University of Westminster, the UK).

These practices may very well result in incidental harm to civilians or incidental damage to civilian objects, yet they are either directed at an object that is not necessarily a military objective or they are not directed at any object or person at all. In light of the sheer universality of these practices for many decades-both before and after the conclusion of Additional Protocol I-this Article proposes four preliminary lines of thought that may help in gaining a better understanding of Additional Protocol I's provisions as well as their application in ground operations. * Immediate Past Head, International Law Department, Military Advocate General's Corps, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) (2011-2017).

        "abstract": "In the context of linear discrete state-space (LDSS) models, we generalize a result lately introduced in the restricted case of invertible state matrices, namely that the linear minimum variance distortionless response (LMVDR) filter shares exactly the same recursion as the linear least mean squares (LLMS) filter, aka the Kalman filter (KF), except for the initialization. An immediate benefit is the introduction of LMVDR fixed-point and fixed-lag smoothers (and possibly other smoothers or predictors), which has not been possible so far. This result is particularly noteworthy given the fact that, although LMVDR estimators are sub-optimal in mean-squared error sense, they are infinite impulse response distortionless estimators which do not depend on the prior knowledge on the mean and covariance matrix of the initial state. Thus the LMVDR estimators may outperform the usual LLMS estimators in case of misspecification of the prior knowledge on the initial state. Seen from this perspective, we also show that the LMVDR filter can be regarded as a generalization of the information filter form of the KF. On another note, LMVDR estimators may also allow to derive unexpected results, as highlighted with the LMVDR fixed-point smoother.",

        "abstract": "Within the last few years, there have been a number of cases moving through streams of state litigation involving small business owners who open their businesses to the public and get in trouble for refusing to serve members of the LGBT community. In all of these instances, the issue that the employees are contesting is that their refusal to provide some specific service is disconnected from the customer’s sexual orientation, but is, instead, linked to the seeming endorsement of the activity for which the service is provided (e.g., a wedding cake goes towards endorsing the marriage). Courts, for the most part, have ignored this distinction and treated refusals to provide a requested service as a per se rejection of that person’s identity because the activity is considered to be “inextricably” connected with that person’s dignity (e.g., marriage for homosexuality). This Article argues that this “non-distinction approach” is really a legal fiction (something counter to known facts), which advances the interest of the court in using antidiscrimination laws for the sake of socially engineering an atmosphere that protects the LGBT-community from † Anton Sorkin (JD, LLM, SJD Candidate) is an employment attorney in Atlanta and a doctorate student working part-time with the Restoring Religious Freedom Project at the Center for the Study of Law & Religion (Emory University School of Law).

Since migrating from the Caribbean in 1991, he has pioneered the use of eclectic dance/movements within the cross-cultural psychotherapeutic relationship, to facilitate health and healing in the United Kingdom, and more recently in Kazakhstan, as an International Consultant to the British Council.

Terry has also designed and served as the Higher Education Manager for the world's first MSc Degree in Integrated Dance Movement Psychotherapy, which was launched by the University of Worcester (UK) in October, 2010 in partnership (one which he engineered) with the Birmingham Centre for Arts Therapies.IntroductionThe opening assertion by Ethnochoreographologist Doris Green provides the mandate for this articlei which explicates the therapeutic essence and Ubuntugogical educational technique of African holistic dance and traditional music, as catalysts of critical thinking in teaching and learning. Generally, dance and music (both more integrated than historically appreciated) have always dominated central roles in therapy and healing throughout the African continent. For example, within the West African religious practice of bori, or agun, women exhibiting signs and impairment associated with particular types of mental disorder, are taken to a shrine where they learn a ceremony involving song and dance for approximately three months. However, during such a ritual of reinvigoration, the process of learning is deemed as equally important for the women's therapy as the ceremony itself (Some, 1998, Satcher and Pamies, 2006). This particular learning activity can be positioned within the context of intellect and imagination - each purposively qualified by the adjective 'creative'.And in Africa, as in the larger Global Majority Community, nothing short of the exercise conjointly of the 'creative' imagination and the 'creative' intellect can fare with the vibrant kaleidoscopic curiosities of existence that must be identified, investigated, understood and transmitted for living as praxis.For the purpose of this article, such cognitive alchemy, if anything, signifies the kernel of critical thinking in which \"all the disparate elements of reality, seemingly separate and disconnected, must be welded into discernable, manageable patterns of thought and comprehension, as well as structures making up the building blocks of the epistemological edifice that gives us meaning, understanding and the grasp and conquest of truth\" (Nettleford, cited in Hall, 2006:72). …",

The health dimension of sustainable development has led to a rethinking of the management of shared water resources, and the case of Lake Victoria demonstrates this. Attempts to integrate health concerns into the sustainable management of Lake Victoria face challenges because the substantive legal regime for tackling health issues and its implementation has been weak. This paper argues for reinvigorating the centrality of health in sustainable environmental management of shared water resources. Health, environment, and natural resources are interdependent and key aspects of sustainable development., Man-made and natural capital (i.e., health, flora, and fauna) complement each other. As a result, new tools for sustainable health and safety risk assessment integrate human health, ecosystem integrity, and economic concerns. 3 The Rio Declaration reflects the shift towards an anthropocentric approach to environmental law, declaring that \"human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development.\" 4 International human rights law also recognizes the right to a healthy environment, culminating in the recent adoption by the U.N. General Assembly of the human right to water and sanitation. 5 Several global and regional legal instruments incorporate sustainable development. But it is argued that the social pillar of sustainability, which includes health, is not firmly embedded in sustainable development law, despite this concept promoting human health. On the other hand, these instruments have not effectively integrated or implemented health protection. The legal regime for sustainable management of Lake Victoria (Lake) reflects this trend. This paper is comprised of six parts. Part I focuses on the problematic posits of human health in international environmental law and policy. Part H provides an overview of the environmental health crisis facing the Lake Victoria Basin (Basin) in a global context. Part Ill presents applicable international law relating to sustainable development, examining its health protection potential in the context of water resource management. Part IV examines the East African community's legal regime for the governance of Lake Victoria in international and comparative legal contexts. Part V is a critique of the health and sustainability of the governance mechanisms for the Basin. Part VI provides conclusions and considers the implications for policy development. B.

        "title": "'Business, Law and Regulation': A Model for Developing 'Critical Thinking' Skills in Future Law Graduates",
        "abstract": "In Australia, it is generally accepted that the role of legal education is to satisfy the academic requirements prescribed for admission to legal practice as a practitioner. As the nature of legal practice changes, legal education must adapt to meet the needs of the legal profession. Recently, the legal profession has seen substantial changes due to a significant growth in globalisation and advancement in technology. These changes have led the profession to hypothesise the role and purpose of lawyers in society moving into the future. In a changing and dynamic profession, it is important to equip law graduates with core legal knowledge and skills in order to adequately prepare them for the evolving legal profession. Undisputedly, the teaching of black letter law forms a substantial basis of most undergraduate Bachelor of Laws curricula. Although discipline knowledge is a prominent aspect of the Australian Qualification Framework, the Australian Learning & Teaching Council’s Leaning and Teaching Academic Standards Project for the Bachelor of Laws, and the Council of Australian Law Deans’ Standards, each of these frameworks also place emphasis on the importance of the acquisition of core legal skills, such as critical thinking. The skill of critical thinking is a pivotal part of tertiary education in many disciplines, and an essential aspect of ‘thinking like a lawyer’. When engaging in legal research and problem solving, it is important that law students and graduates are able to critically analyse, evaluate and create solutions. In an increasingly technological world, where artificial intelligence is used as a means of conveying legal knowledge, it is important to equip law students and graduates with the skill to critically analyse and create solutions to solve legal problems. These skills are often reflected in University Graduate Attributes, and employers frequently cite the ability of engaging in critical analysis as an essential and valuable skill in law graduates. The incorporation of critical thinking into the law curriculum varies between institutions and disciplines, creating much scholarly commentary on the best approach. This paper outlines the approach adopted by the Curtin Law School to promote critical thinking skills in the first-year compulsory unit, ‘Business, Law and Regulation’. It is argued that the introduction of this skill during the first year of legal studies is essential. By promoting the skill of critical thinking in first year, students are given a robust foundation upon which they can build refined critical thinking skills in later years of study, before they graduate. * LLM, LLB, BCom, GradDipLegPrac, GradCertHE, Lecturer, Curtin Law School, Curtin University, Perth, Australia. ** LLB(Hons), BCom, MTax.

        "title": "Assessing the UK’s Public Interest Test in Light of Societal Uncertainty",
        "abstract": "This paper examines the long-standing debate on the regulation of foreign takeovers, and the protection of public interests by the government in relation to them, in light of societal uncertainty present in the UK. This uncertainty is being generated by two developments: Brexit and the rise of Artificial Intelligence. This paper argues that the task of regulating foreign takeovers should be viewed as one of balancing three objectives: the promotion of economic growth, the protection of public interest, and the management of social considerations resulting from these takeovers. Furthermore, it is argued that the current Public Interest Test should be restated for clarity and specificity. Finally, the creation of an independent body to administer the Public Interest Test and to negotiate social considerations that arise in relation to foreign takeovers is discussed, evaluated and endorsed. A. INTRODUCTION Professor Shamir wrote about the management of legal uncertainties during the New Deal era in the US, which occurred in the 1930s and 40s. He observed that during a crisis, ‘old certainties have to be defended, and uncertainties knock on the door of established structures’.1 Much like the US following the Great Depression, the UK is facing an acute period of uncertainty and change. In the aftermath of Brexit, and as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and new technologies are beginning to be integrated into society,2 concerns about the precarious state of the economy have grown,3 and socially, people are feeling insecure and anxious about the future.4 The regulation of foreign takeovers and the protection of public interests in relation to them have been a long-standing topic of debate in the UK.5 Recently, Prime Minister Theresa May identified reforming the UK’s Public Interest Test (PIT) as one of her government’s priorities * LLB (Hons) European Law School Programme (Maastricht University); LLM Corporate Law (University College London).

DOI: 10.14324/111.2052-1871.100 164 in the current environment of uncertainty.6 She emphasised that the UK’s focus on attracting foreign investment should remain, but that social considerations should be given more weight.7 The Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn took this a step further recently, and stated that a future Labour government would enforce a broadening of the PIT.8 This paper discusses whether the UK’s PIT should indeed be reformed, and examines the option of introducing a forum for social concerns arising in the context of foreign takeovers to be heard and assessed. Social considerations, for the purposes of this paper, are defined as the anxieties and demands of society which can be inferred from political and popular perceptions and sentiment towards societal developments. Concerns that emerge in relation to foreign takeovers and which are mentioned in this paper revolve around the extraction of economic value (which covers job displacement), the protection of key national industries or companies, and tax avoidance by foreign companies. Social considerations should be distinguished from the concept of public interest. This author considers public interest to be a broad concept, comprised of a country’s fundamental interests, general well-being and functioning at a given time. This paper argues that the regulation of foreign takeovers should not provide a wide scope for government intervention, and in particular should resist protectionism, because foreign takeovers serve valuable functions.9 These functions are discussed in section B, which subsequently also provides an overview of the regulation of foreign takeovers in the UK, and explains the PIT. Thereafter, section C explains the complexity of the task of regulating foreign takeovers. It outlines the UK’s regulation of foreign takeovers to date, and identifies the challenges to the task of regulating foreign takeovers presented by the effects of Brexit and the integration of AI into society. Section D establishes that there is a need for foreign takeover regulations in the UK to acknowledge social considerations, and reconceptualises the task of regulating foreign takeovers.

        "title": "Performance Analysis and Application of Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage in a Power System",
        "abstract": "Delivering an adequate amount of power to electrical equipment is being a tough job due to the continuous upgradation and technological advancement in the equipment. One of such familiar challenging technology adapted nowadays in power system for some specific applications is termed as pulsed power technology. The electrical grid with pulsed power loads is of the significant interest in aerospace and marine applications. Keeping in the mind of pulsed power applications, especially in defence sectors, the Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) system is proposed for a smooth and reliable power flow in the grid. In SMES system, the PCU interfaces the SMES magnet and the AC system in order to give an efficient power exchange and high quality power flow. Power Converter Unit (PCU) of the SMES system consists of a bidirectional DC-DC converter and a three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) coupled with a common DC-link capacitor. The control schemes employed for both the VSI and DC-DC converter is intended to maintain a constant DC-link voltage. Particularly, the voltage across the DC-link capacitor is tightly regulated using a Dynamic Evolution Control (DEC) strategy instead of a PI controller for the DC-DC converter. Consequently, the DC-link voltage is maintained almost constant with a voltage regulation well below ±10% during a Pulsed Power Load (PPL) condition. Initially, the performance of the SMES system using a Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS) control algorithm is compared with that using a Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) control technique. The comparison is presented to show the effectiveness of the SMES system for power quality improvement. Henceforth, the control scheme for the VSI is proposed based on the Modified SRF (MSRF). Similarly, DEC or PI control strategy is employed to generate appropriate switching pulses for the DC-DC converter. It has been observed that the PI in the inner loop of MSRF is found sluggish during the PPL. Thus, PI is replaced by the DEC scheme to provide a fast response to the PPL. Also, the DC-DC converter employs the DEC instead of a PI in order to achieve a less rippled coil current and uniform voltage distribution across the SMES coil irrespective of load profile. Consequently, it ensures a reduced and acceptable AC loss across the SMES system, and a symmetric voltage distribution across the coil. Moreover, the control performance of the DEC scheme is compared with that of the Proportional-Integral (PI) control technique. A uniform source current and power with minimum variations is maintained irrespective of the pulsed power load. A detrimental high rating stress on the system due to the load is substantially reduced by the proposed system. The DEC scheme is implemented for tight error regulation of the controlling parameters. The system supply current is found almost balanced, and its Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is found well below 5%. An effective PPL compensation and a symmetric and uniform voltage distribution across the SMES coil, are achieved due to the precise solid-state control. Nevertheless, it has been seen that the SAPF is incompetent under high PPL demands whereas the SMES system has shown excellent performance under such load conditions. Moreover, a comparative analysis has been made between the conventional SAPF and the SMES system under PPL and Nonlinear Load (NL) conditions, to check the effectiveness of the SMES system. The performance of the proposed system is presented by using Sim Power System (SPS)/MATLAB Simulink, and real-time digital simulator (i.e. Opal RT-Lab/ dSPACE-1104).",

        "abstract": "Maligni melanom spada u zlocudne tumore koji nastaje preobrazbom melanocita. Najcesce se pojavljuje na koži, no može nastati i na drugim dijelovima tijela koji sadrže melanocite (respiratorni, urogenitalni, gastrointestinalni trakt, oci, limfni cvorovi i moždana ovojnica). Incidencija melanoma posljednjih nekoliko desetljeca u svijetu znacajno raste, pa tako i u Hrvatskoj. Godisnje povecanje oboljelih je oko 7%. U Republici Hrvatskoj godisnje se otkrije oko 587 novooboljelih od melanoma. Melanom nastaje na nepromijenjenoj koži ili iz prekursorskih lezija, a najveci maligni potencijal imaju divovski urođeni i displasticni nevusi. Uglavnom se pojavljuje u osoba srednje životne dobi svijetle puti koji su cesto izloženi suncu i koji imaju gensku sklonost određene mutacije gena. Sumnju na melanom trebalo bi postavit kada se na koži nalazi pigmentirana lezija koja se mijenja tijekom vremena. Melanom je najcesce tamne boje, od smeđe do crne, no može biti i bez pigmenata. Melanom prolazi kroz tri faze rasta: melanoma in situ (oznacava fazu pojave malignih melanocita u epidermisu), radijalna faza (oznacava fazu lateralnog sirenja) i vertikalna faza (oznacava fazu invazije dermisa). Prema klinickim znacajkama i histoloskoj slici razlikujemo 4 glavna tipa maligni melanoma: lentigo maligna melanom – LLM, povrsinsko sireci melanom – SSM, nodularni melanom – NM i akralni lentiginozni melanom – ALM, U otkrivanju ranih melanoma najvažniji je klinicki i dermatoskopski pregled, a dijagnoza se potvrđuje patohistoloskom analizom odstranjene pigmentirane lezije. Najvažniji prognosticki faktori su debljina lezije (klasifikacija po Breslowu) i dubina invazije tumora po Clarku, a danas se najvise koristi sustav stupnjevanja prema AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer). Ukoliko se melanom dijagnosticira u ranoj fazi, u visokom postotku uspjesno se lijeci kirurskom ekscizijom. Ako se u regionalnim limfnim cvorovima dokažu metastaze, izvodi se i disekcija limfnih cvorova. Osim kirurgije u lijecenju melanoma koriste se kemoterapija, radioterapija, biokemoterapija, a dolaskom ciljane terapije melanoma te imunoterapije pocela je nova era u lijecenju metastatskog melanoma. Primjenom imunoterapije bolesnici sa metastatskim melanomom dobivaju na dužini i na kvaliteti preživljavanja. U usporedbi sa skromnim ucincima kemoterapije i zracenja bolesnici lijeceni imunoterapijom mogu preživjeti cak i vise godina, a odgovor bolesnika na terapiju krece se do 50%. Uloga medicinske sestre kao dio zdravstvenog tima je od neprocjenjive važnosti u skrbi za onkoloskog bolesnika. Nuspojave imunoterapije su brojne i nose sa sobom niz medicinskih dijagnoza. Medicinska sestra nakon razgovora s bolesnikom i prikupljenih podataka izrađuje plan zdravstvene njege sa sestrinskom dijagnozom, postavlja ciljeve, 2 planira intervencije, prati stanje bolesnika, evaluira napredak te evidentira u sestrinsku dokumentaciju. U bolesnika oboljelih od melanoma važno je provoditi kontrolne klinicke preglede te pridržavati se svih oblika fotozastite. Kako bi se smanjila incidencija melanoma, bitno je promicati mjere prevencije koje ukljucuju samopregled madeža, pregled dermatologa, izbjegavanje sunca, nosenje naocala (koje stite od UV zraka) adekvatna odjeca, koristenje zastitnih pripravaka.",

        "abstract": "Loom (LM), a hardware inference accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is presented. In LM every bit of data precision that can be saved translates to proportional performance gains. Specifically, for convolutional layers LM’s execution time scales inversely proportionallywith the precisions of both weights and activations. For fully-connected layers LM’s performance scales inversely proportionally with the precision of the weights. LM targets areaand bandwidth-constrained System-on-a-Chip designs such as those found on mobile devices that cannot afford the multimegabyte buffers that would be needed to store each layer on-chip. Accordingly, given a data bandwidth budget, LM boosts energy efficiency and performance over an equivalent bit-parallel accelerator. For both weights and activations LM can exploit profilederived per layer precisions. However, at runtime LM further trims activation precisions at a much smaller than a layer granularity. Moreover, it can naturally exploit weight precision variability at a smaller granularity than a layer. On average, across several image classification CNNs and for a configuration that can perform the equivalent of 128 16b × 16b multiply-accumulate operations per cycle LM outperforms a state-of-the-art bit-parallel accelerator [1] by 4.38× without any loss in accuracy while being 3.54× more energy efficient. LM can trade-off accuracy for additional improvements in execution performance and energy efficiency and compares favorably to an accelerator that targeted only activation precisions. We also study 2and 4-bit LLM variants and find the the 2-bit per cycle variant is the most energy efficient.",

        "abstract": "Groundwater is the key source for irrigation, industrial and domestic uses in India. It is extensively relied upon in different parts of the country without taking into consideration, hydrological nature and availability of water resources resulting in depletion of groundwater at an alarming rate. Existing legal framework along with several other factors add up to this situation. Groundwaterlandownership nexus proves to be the hurdle in effective groundwater regulation and management. Present laws only focus on regulation of use and do not provide for conservation of groundwater. These laws do not change the ownership status. In the light of increasing demand for water for drinking and agricultural purposes, and need for realization of human right to water, there is urgent need to delink groundwater landownership nexus by applying public trust doctrine to groundwater like surface water. Supreme Court of India has already declared rivers and lakes in the country to be held by the state as public trustee but the same has not been applied to groundwater resources. This paper focuses on the applicability of public trust doctrine to groundwater resources in India to ensure its effective conservation. There have been several instances around the world where public trust doctrine has been applied by the courts for groundwater conservation. The principle developed from Roman law has been applied in several jurisdictions for natural resources management. This paper analyses how this principle can be applied in Indian situation for groundwater conservation. For successful application of these reforms, public participation in decision making is inevitable. The affected/ to be affected sections of the society should be included especially in environmental issues. The paper also focuses on the need for public participation in groundwater related issues in India.

        "abstract": "Undocumented migrants often suffer from poor living conditions and face many challenges in receiving access to health care. Reacting to this, France, Italy and Switzerland implemented different provisions aimed at granting access to the national health system for undocumented migrants living in the country. These systems differ significantly depending on the type of national health care system, the financing method and whether or not a separate scheme for undocumented migrants exists. This article analyses the laws and practices in these countries in light of the human rights principle of accessibility, and its elements of non-discrimination, physical accessibility, economic affordability, and information accessibility. Through this comparative analysis, the article evaluates the impact of different solutions on the respect of the human right to health care, identifies the main obstacles to the effective implementation of the principle of accessibility, and proposes policy recommendations for the full implementation of the right to health care. The article concludes in favour of the adoption of a human-rights approach in order to bridge the gap between law and reality. A menudo, los migrantes indocumentados se enfrentan a malas condiciones de vida y a diversos desafíos que limitan su acceso a la atención médica. Para resolver este problema, Francia, Italia y Suiza han adoptado diferentes disposiciones legales destinadas a permitir acceso al sistema nacional de salud para migrantes indocumentados que viven en el país.

It deals at a very broad level with various requirements for the formation, validity, and proof of consumer contracts and terms, and especially with how they are to be applied in modern commercial environments, characterised by the widespread use of standard terms in online contracting. At the heart of the Draft Restatement lies the notion that it reflects a ‘grand bargain’ or trade-off in American consumer contract law. While its rules follow a ‘permissive’ approach to assent, through granting businesses significant freedom to draft contract terms, the effect of these rules is balanced by greater ex post substantive control, through imposing mandatory restrictions on terms. The purpose of this paper is to view this central idea of the Draft Restatement, as well as some related features, from the perspective of South African consumer contract law. Aspects that enjoy attention include the treatment of standard contracts, rules on actual or deemed assent, various forms of substantive control, the relationship between common-law and statutory regulation of consumer contracts, restrictions on adducing evidence, and the most appropriate institutions for granting consumers effective relief. * BComm LLB LLM (Stell) PhD (Aberdeen).

        "title": "Police Independence vs Military Discipline: Democratic Policing in the Canadian Forces",
        "abstract": "Over the last 25 years, there has been a gradual acceptance within the Canadian Forces that Military Police need to be able to function independently when exercising their duties as police officers. This acceptance has led to organizational and administrative changes to provide such independence to MP members; however, despite these changes, there remains the risk that MP independence may be eroded in the course of criminal or disciplinary investigations. This article presents two recent matters to illustrate that the independence currently afforded to MP investigators is still very much in doubt. The first is the recent decision of the Court Martial Court of Appeal in R v Wellwood, which brought the dichotomy of MP independence and the need to maintain discipline and a rigid obedience to orders from a superior squarely before the court. The second is the recent controversy surrounding the MP investigation into allegations against Lieutenant Colonel Mason Stalker, which ultimately resulted in a stay of proceedings being directed on all charges and Stalker launching a lawsuit against the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Forces. * Jonathan Avey, CD, JD, is a Crown Attorney with the Manitoba Prosecution Service and an LLM candidate at the Osgoode Hall Faculty of Law at York University, and previously served for 14 years in the Canadian Armed Forces.

Specific sections of the National Defence Act inappropriately permit senior members of the CF to interfere in MP investigations. In the absence of a finding that police independence is a principle of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the Charter, it falls to Parliament to ensure that Military Police personnel are free to carry out police functions in an independent manner. The offending portions of the NDA should be immediately repealed and further amendments should be enacted that prohibit any interference in MP investigations.",

To date, there is no known empirical study of police practices and policies regarding these norms.

In addition, the survey explores chiefs’ perceptions regarding the implications of Gant for police vehicle searches incident to arrest specifically and police vehicle searches more broadly. In general, the study’s detailed findings align with current Fourth Amendment norms in the police vehicle search context; that is, chief perception of officer policies and practices related to vehicle searches aligns with Fourth Amendment requirements in this area, including search incident to arrest law under Gant. In addition, almost half of the chiefs surveyed indicated that officers have searched vehicles less often incident to arrest because of Gant. This latter finding is noteworthy, and appears to align with the limitations imposed by Gant on vehicle searches incident to arrest. Various implications of the findings for the police and the judiciary are explored.",

        "abstract": "The research work is aimed at describing and interpreting the pedagogical practices of some of the teachers of the BA in Modern Languages (BAML) of the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana (PUJ) under the perspective of an inclusive education and from the differential approach. Considering that its mission is based on the Jesuit principles, and it proposes to serve the human community, especially to the Colombian, to create a more just, sustainable, inclusive, democratic, solidary and respectful society of human dignity (PUJ, 2013), this research is intended to see reflected this mission in the pedagogical practices developed by teachers in the classrooms of the BAML. For this purpose, a research methodology is developed under a mixed approach, since both qualitative and quantitative data are considered. In addition, observations are made with approximation to case study and some questionnaires are designed to identify, describe and interpret the pedagogical practices of teachers. Furthermore, this project is exploratory, given that previously no research was carried out regarding the inclusion in the practices of teacher educators in the BAML. Thanks to the results, it is possible to demonstrate the diversity existing within the LLM by professors and students at the ethnic, cultural, socioeconomic, life-cycle and identity levels. On the other hand, it is possible to highlight some pedagogical practices that promote inclusion in the classroom as equal treatment, support for students, acceptance for diversity, highlight and exalt achievements, among others; as well as suggesting some others to diminish the barriers that could generate an apparent exclusion in the teaching-learning process as encouraging the integration and reintegration of students, taking into account the availability of the resources with which the students have or not, being a mediator of conflicts and various situations, among others.",

        "abstract": "Fragmentation isapowerfulphenomenon derived from human thinking, also finding expression in the context of the regulation ofinternational trade under the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trade fragmentation is particularly found in the prevailing conception ofinternational trade law, as being a discipline ofpublicinternationallaw, on one hand with nation states as the sole actors ofpublicinternationallaw, and, on the other hand, a discline ofprivateinternational commercial law with privatepersons and companies as the central actors. However, important changes to the international business and trading environment, often caused by an unprecedented pace oftechnological innovation, have occurred which threaten to render this perception not only obsolete but inapt to cope with the most imminent challenges to the regulation ofinternational trade. For instance, as restrictions to trade at state borders are being removed by wayofmultilateral trade negotiations, increasinglynon-tariff barriers in the form ofdomestic regulation are being erected. Paradoxically, state regulation is not the only source ofnewrestrictions to trade capable offragmenting the global market. These trade restrictions can also have their origin in the actions ofprivate parties. Rostam J. Neuwirth, Mag. iur.

        "title": "Development of Adaptive Controllers for Grid Integration of a Three-Phase PV System",
        "abstract": "A PV system, particularly a large power one is usually operated in a grid tied mode.In view of achieving effective grid integration of a PV system, the necessity of important control algorithms are as follows. At first, Maximum power point tracking control for extraction of maximum power from the PV panels. Then in order to control the transfer of active power and reactive power from the inverter and grid to load, it is necessary to estimate the reference inverter current. Thus, there is a need of employing an adaptive filtering algorithm for this estimation. Furthermore, an appropriate switching signals for the inverter to be generated to control the inverter such that the actual inverter current will track the reference inverter current. Therefore, in order to achieve effective grid synchronization of a three-phase PV system, we first designed a grid integration control scheme in which Incremental Conductance (IC) is employed for the maximum power tracking control, Instantaneous Power Theory (IPT) for estimation of reference inverter current and a Sliding Mode Controller (SMC) for generating appropriate inverter switching signals. \n The output of a PV system varies with variation in solar irradiance and temperature. Further, the V-I characteristics of a PV panel is nonlinear, therefore it is essential to operate a PV panel at the Maximum Power Point (MPP) in order to extract maximum power from it. This can be accomplished by designing an efficient Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm for a PV system that can handle the situation of varied solar irradiance and temperature. But in order to handle the above situation, IC MPPT algorithm is found to be ineffective. Hence, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based adaptive MPPT algorithm is proposed in this thesis to extract maximum output power from the PV panels during the changes in solar irradiance and temperature. The performance of the proposed RL MPPT algorithm is compared with that of IC MPPT algorithm and an advance MPPT algorithm e.g. Fuzzy Logic (FL) based MPPT algorithm. It is observed from the obtained results that the proposed RLMPPT algorithm exhibits improved maximum power tracking performance than both the IC MPPT and FL MPPT algorithms when there are variations in solar irradiance and temperature. \n In order to achieve the grid power factor unity and the THD of the grid current should be within the permissible limits of IEEE-519 standard, a suitable estimation algorithm is essential for estimating the reference inverter current. Therefore, in developing the control schemes for grid synchronization of a PV system the estimation of reference current and its tracking are necessary. Some of the reported algorithms for estimation of reference currents e.g. Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF), Instantaneous Power Theory (IPT) have limitations in the situations of grid disturbances and load variations. The advanced algorithms e.g. Least mean square (LMS), Variable Step Size-Least Mean Square (VSS-LMS), Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS) have also limitations such as slow convergence rate, parameter drifting and more complexity. It is thus necessary to develop an adaptive estimation algorithm for estimation of reference inverter current. In view of resolving the aforesaid limitations, we propose to employ the Variable Leaky Least Mean Square (VLLMS) algorithm for estimation of reference inverter current. The VLLMS algorithm is employed for the ideal grid (without grid voltage distortion), distorted grid, unbalanced grid, unbalanced and distributed grid, unbalanced load and variable solar irradiance conditions. The performance of the VLLMS algorithm is compared with that of the Leaky Least Mean square (LLMS) and Instantaneous Power Theory (IPT) based reference inverter current estimation algorithms. It is observed from the comparison that VLLMS algorithm outperforms in reducing the THD with no overshoot and undershoot in the grid current waveform during the aforesaid situations. \n However, for generation of switching signals for inverter to track the reference inverter current, firstly we employ a sliding mode controller to handle the uncertain dynamics of the inverter. The performance of sliding mode controller is compared with the other two popular control algorithms e.g. hysteresis controller and adaptive hysteresis controller. Further, in order to handle the parametric variations in the VSI e.g. inductance and resistance of VSI and the variations in the load and grid disturbances, we design an Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller. The performance of adaptive sliding mode controller is compared to that of sliding mode controller during the parametric variation, load variation and grid disturbances. \n All the proposed PV grid integration control schemes namely Incremental Conductance- Instantaneous Power Theory-Sliding Mode Controller (IC-IPT-SMC), Reinforcement Learning-IPT-SMC (RL-IPT-SMC), RL-Variable Leaky Least mean Square- SMC (RL-VLLMS-SMC) and RL-VLLMS-Adaptive Sliding Mode Controller (RLVLLMS- ASMC) were implemented in MATLAB R/Simulink Rand then in real-time on a PV prototype setup developed in the laboratory. The performances of all these controllers are evaluated and it is found that RL-VLLMS-ASMC exhibits superior performance in terms of effective maximum power extraction, fast and robust harmonic compensation during variation in solar irradiance and temperature, parametric uncertainties, grid disturbances and load variations.",

        "title": "'Business, Law and Regulation': A Model for Developing 'Critical Thinking' Skills in Future Law Graduates",
        "abstract": "In Australia, it is generally accepted that the role of legal education is to satisfy the academic requirements prescribed for admission to legal practice as a practitioner. As the nature of legal practice changes, legal education must adapt to meet the needs of the legal profession. Recently, the legal profession has seen substantial changes due to a significant growth in globalisation and advancement in technology. These changes have led the profession to hypothesise the role and purpose of lawyers in society moving into the future. In a changing and dynamic profession, it is important to equip law graduates with core legal knowledge and skills in order to adequately prepare them for the evolving legal profession. Undisputedly, the teaching of black letter law forms a substantial basis of most undergraduate Bachelor of Laws curricula. Although discipline knowledge is a prominent aspect of the Australian Qualification Framework, the Australian Learning & Teaching Council’s Leaning and Teaching Academic Standards Project for the Bachelor of Laws, and the Council of Australian Law Deans’ Standards, each of these frameworks also place emphasis on the importance of the acquisition of core legal skills, such as critical thinking. The skill of critical thinking is a pivotal part of tertiary education in many disciplines, and an essential aspect of ‘thinking like a lawyer’. When engaging in legal research and problem solving, it is important that law students and graduates are able to critically analyse, evaluate and create solutions. In an increasingly technological world, where artificial intelligence is used as a means of conveying legal knowledge, it is important to equip law students and graduates with the skill to critically analyse and create solutions to solve legal problems. These skills are often reflected in University Graduate Attributes, and employers frequently cite the ability of engaging in critical analysis as an essential and valuable skill in law graduates. The incorporation of critical thinking into the law curriculum varies between institutions and disciplines, creating much scholarly commentary on the best approach. This paper outlines the approach adopted by the Curtin Law School to promote critical thinking skills in the first-year compulsory unit, ‘Business, Law and Regulation’. It is argued that the introduction of this skill during the first year of legal studies is essential. By promoting the skill of critical thinking in first year, students are given a robust foundation upon which they can build refined critical thinking skills in later years of study, before they graduate. * LLM, LLB, BCom, GradDipLegPrac, GradCertHE, Lecturer, Curtin Law School, Curtin University, Perth, Australia. ** LLB(Hons), BCom, MTax.

        "abstract": "This research aims to identify the perceptions of students of the English courses about the factors that affect their performance in the language use exam, applied in the EFL context of the B.A. in Modern Languages at the Pontifical Xaverian University. This research emerged from a survey addressed to 25 students, who had completed all the English levels, which revealed that the student’s results in the language use exams were usually low. In turn, it was confirmed that this issue was related to certain factors previously identified by authors such as Nowreyah, Muneera & Hanan (2013), Shiu (2011) and Birjandi & Alemi (2010), who consider that there are aspects related to the exam design, linguistic and psychological that can influence the performance of the students when they face a language test. Hence, the categories of the theoretical framework of the project were based mainly on these factors. A mixed approach was taken for the elaboration of the investigation, in which a Likert questionnaire was used, of a quantitative nature, and a focus group that allowed delving into the most relevant aspects that arose in the application of the survey. A sample of ten students from each English level was taken for the survey and one student from each level for the focus group. Therefore, the results revealed that there were different aspects related to the principles of test design that may affect the students’ performance in the language use exam. Also, it was observed that the main linguistic difficulty for the students was the learning of the vocabulary. Furthermore, it was found that in the LLM the anxiety was the aspect that most affected the students’ performance on the language use exam.",

        "abstract": "The Criminal Justice System in Canada and the United States is no longer a system based upon trials, it is now a system of plea bargaining. Though the system of adjudication has changed, in the American Federal System disclosure obligations on the prosecution have not evolved. At the guilty plea stage disclosure obligations are not minimal, they are practically non-existent. This article sets the stage for the current state of the law in the American Federal System and then proposes three possible avenues for reform ranging from moderate to extreme. These proposed reforms are 1) a reimagining of Brady obligations in light of the Seventh and Tenth Circuits’ interpretation of Ruiz; 2) a wholesale adoption of the American Bar Association’s 1996 proposed reforms; or, 3) adopting the Canadian approach to disclosure obligations at the plea-bargaining stage. The article concludes by advocating for the adoption of the Canadian model, suggesting that the American Bar Association Reform would be impractical and the reimagining of Brady would not go far enough to adapt to the 21 century method of criminal adjudication. * Myles Anevich, BA (McGill University), JD (University of Windsor), LLM (Columbia Law School), is a criminal defence attorney practicing in Toronto Ontario.

        "title": "Arbitration as a Tool for Management of Community Land Conflicts in Kenya",
        "abstract": "Arbitration and other forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms have been designated as some of the methods of dealing with disputes and conflicts involving community land as expressly provided under section 39 (1) of Community Land Act. However, the Community Land Act fails to appreciate the distinction between disputes settlement and conflicts resolution. This paper therefore focuses on the management of community land conflicts through arbitration in Kenya. While the Community Land Act 2016 envisages the use of various ADR mechanisms as conflict management mechanisms, the scope of this paper is limited to examining the effectiveness of arbitration as a tool for management of community land conflicts. The main hypothesis is that arbitration is ordinarily conceived is coercive and results in outcomes similar to those found in litigation and this, based on African communities desire for reconciliatory approaches, makes it inappropriate in addressing community land disputes and conflicts. The paper also seeks to prove the following hypotheses: firstly, arbitration is not an effective tool in the management of natural resources with regard to community land in Kenya; secondly, the apparent conflict between the characteristics and nature of community land conflicts and the nature and process or arbitration, devoid of any harmonization, may defeat the intentions of Article 159 of the Constitution; and thirdly, the viable panacea to settling community land-based conflicts is to adopt a hybrid ADR mechanisms so as to achieve a customised approach. It also attempts to contribute to the legal debate and suggest the best way forward in making arbitration and to an extension ADR, a much more effective tool for the management of community land conflicts in Kenya. 1.0 Introduction Law is a social mechanism, a means to further the ends of society. Thus, it is arguable that the use of law as a tool in dealing with social conflicts in any society should not be done in a rigid manner but should instead respond to the particular circumstances and needs of the society in question. This approach thus informs this study in coming up with the most responsive conflict management mechanism(s) for managing community land conflicts in Kenya. Land is a natural resource and undoubtedly, the management of land as a natural resource and the resultant conflicts thereof has important ripple effects in a given country. In Kenya, the case is ‘worsened’ by the contentious history of land laws, the emotive nature of the land question as well as the real or perceived land injustices in the country since the pre-colonial era. This study takes cognizance of the fact that various efforts have been commissioned in a bid to provide expeditious, affordable and just mechanisms that enable smooth and practical processing of land disputes and conflicts. One of the issues under examination in this paper, however, is the adequacy and effectiveness of arbitration as a tool for managing community land-based conflicts. LLB (Hons), LLM (UON), PG Dip.

Arbitration as a Tool for Management of Community Land (2019) Journalofcmsd Volume 3(1) Conflicts in Kenya: James Ndungu Njuguna 39 The Constitution of Kenya 2010 recognizes the principle of promoting alternative forms of dispute resolution including reconciliation, mediation, arbitration and traditional dispute resolution mechanisms as one the principles that should guide the courts and tribunals when exercising judicial authority. While this provision is not specific on the kind of disputes and conflicts to be submitted to alternative forms of dispute resolution, there are other provisions that contemplate such disputes or conflicts as including community land conflicts. For instance, the Constitution also requires that land in Kenya should be held, used and managed in accordance with the principles of, inter alia, encouragement of communities to settle land disputes through recognized local community initiatives consistent with the Constitution. Notably, one of the recognized classifications of land under the Constitution is community land. Community Land Act 2016 was enacted to give effect to Article 63 (5) of the Constitution. It provides for recognition, protection and registration of community land rights, management and administration of community land and for the role of county governments in relation to unregistered community land. It also allows a registered community to use Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms including arbitration where it is appropriate to do so, for purposes of settling disputes and conflicts involving community land. The Community Land Act allows the parties to community land disputes to jointly refer the dispute to arbitration. Furthermore, where the parties to an arbitration agreement fail to agree on the appointment of an arbitrator or arbitrators, the provisions of Arbitration Act relating to the appointment of arbitrators are to apply. One of the issues that may have informed the need for inclusion of ADR mechanisms including arbitration as part of available mechanisms for management of community land disputes and conflicts is the inadequacy and the hurdles that bedevil litigation. While Community land disputes may easily be managed using dispute settlement mechanisms, community land conflicts are sui generis in nature requiring a carefully customized approach. In as much as arbitration is a voluntary and an alternative resolution process, it is similar to litigation in some aspects considering that they are both settlement mechanisms. It is adversarial in nature with minimal or no chances of saving existing relations. It is in light of this that this paper discusses the effectiveness of arbitration in managing community land conflicts as provided for under the Community Land Act 2016. One of objectives of the Constitution and the Community Land Act 2016 is to promote reconciliation amongst community members especially in land management matters. Arbitration is arguably not one of the most viable mechanisms of promoting reconciliation in the context of community land disputes owing to some of its intrinsic characteristics. Unless this legal debate is broached and recommendations implemented, the objects and intentions under Article 159 and article 63 (5) of the Constitution might stand frustrated and suppressed or at most be rendered elusive.

Arbitration as a Tool for Management of Community Land (2019) Journalofcmsd Volume 3(1) Conflicts in Kenya: James Ndungu Njuguna 40 2.0 Background Some authors observe that in the traditional African setup, indigenous resource management systems reflected the way communities organized their lives within the constraints of the environment in which they lived. Decision-making institutions focused on utilizing and managing environmental resources based on the knowledge of the community and within the framework of their ethics, norms and beliefs. They also observe that resource use systems relied upon building reciprocal relations among families and communities, for example, through livestock sharing, and with other groups and communities through trade, marriage and advisers. These relations redistributed risk and strengthened social obligations to be utilized during times of drought, pestilence or war. The indigenous tenure systems thus provided high levels of tenure security. They however acknowledge that over time customary tenure systems in Africa have spontaneously evolved “from more diffuse and collective to more specific, exclusionary individual rights” in response to population pressure and commercialization of agriculture. Undoubtedly, customary land law tenure and colonial administration are critical factors that have shaped the evolution of property laws and the existing property regimes and proprietary transactions in Kenya. Community ownership of land stems from the pre-colonial period. Colonialists then introduced land tenure systems of private land when they settled in Africa. Despite several spirited attempts by the colonial government to erase the concept of African commons, community land ownership persisted, as a parallel and informal system. Due to the lack of a comprehensive legal framework, it was not recognized as a legitimate form of ownership, which in turn encouraged its conversion to private land. It was with the development of t",

        "title": "Assessing the UK’s Public Interest Test in Light of Societal Uncertainty",
        "abstract": "This paper examines the long-standing debate on the regulation of foreign takeovers, and the protection of public interests by the government in relation to them, in light of societal uncertainty present in the UK. This uncertainty is being generated by two developments: Brexit and the rise of Artificial Intelligence. This paper argues that the task of regulating foreign takeovers should be viewed as one of balancing three objectives: the promotion of economic growth, the protection of public interest, and the management of social considerations resulting from these takeovers. Furthermore, it is argued that the current Public Interest Test should be restated for clarity and specificity. Finally, the creation of an independent body to administer the Public Interest Test and to negotiate social considerations that arise in relation to foreign takeovers is discussed, evaluated and endorsed. A. INTRODUCTION Professor Shamir wrote about the management of legal uncertainties during the New Deal era in the US, which occurred in the 1930s and 40s. He observed that during a crisis, ‘old certainties have to be defended, and uncertainties knock on the door of established structures’.1 Much like the US following the Great Depression, the UK is facing an acute period of uncertainty and change. In the aftermath of Brexit, and as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and new technologies are beginning to be integrated into society,2 concerns about the precarious state of the economy have grown,3 and socially, people are feeling insecure and anxious about the future.4 The regulation of foreign takeovers and the protection of public interests in relation to them have been a long-standing topic of debate in the UK.5 Recently, Prime Minister Theresa May identified reforming the UK’s Public Interest Test (PIT) as one of her government’s priorities * LLB (Hons) European Law School Programme (Maastricht University); LLM Corporate Law (University College London). The author would like to thank Anne, Kari, Sara and Elina for their endless support and encouragement, as well as the editors of this journal for their helpful comments and feedback on earlier versions of this paper. 1 Ronen Shamir, Managing Legal Uncertainty: Elite Lawyers in the New Deal (Duke University Press 1995) 2. 2 Martin Arnold, ‘Banks’ AI plans threaten thousands of jobs’ Financial Times (London, 25 January 2017) <https://www.ft.com/content/3da058a0-e268-11e6-8405-9e5580d6e5fb> accessed 4 September 2017; Jane Croft, ‘Artificial intelligence closes in on the work of junior lawyers’ Financial Times (London 4 May 2017) <https://www.ft.com/content/f809870c-26a1-11e7-8691-d5f7e0cd0a16> accessed 4 September 2017. 3 Mathew Lawrence, Future Proof: Britain in the 2020s (Institute for Public Policy Research 2016) 14 <https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/future-proof-britain-in-the-2020s> accessed 4 September 2017. 4 Thomas Oliver, ‘A New British identity is key to Brexit’s success.

DOI: 10.14324/111.2052-1871.100 164 in the current environment of uncertainty.6 She emphasised that the UK’s focus on attracting foreign investment should remain, but that social considerations should be given more weight.7 The Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn took this a step further recently, and stated that a future Labour government would enforce a broadening of the PIT.8 This paper discusses whether the UK’s PIT should indeed be reformed, and examines the option of introducing a forum for social concerns arising in the context of foreign takeovers to be heard and assessed. Social considerations, for the purposes of this paper, are defined as the anxieties and demands of society which can be inferred from political and popular perceptions and sentiment towards societal developments. Concerns that emerge in relation to foreign takeovers and which are mentioned in this paper revolve around the extraction of economic value (which covers job displacement), the protection of key national industries or companies, and tax avoidance by foreign companies. Social considerations should be distinguished from the concept of public interest. This author considers public interest to be a broad concept, comprised of a country’s fundamental interests, general well-being and functioning at a given time. This paper argues that the regulation of foreign takeovers should not provide a wide scope for government intervention, and in particular should resist protectionism, because foreign takeovers serve valuable functions.9 These functions are discussed in section B, which subsequently also provides an overview of the regulation of foreign takeovers in the UK, and explains the PIT. Thereafter, section C explains the complexity of the task of regulating foreign takeovers. It outlines the UK’s regulation of foreign takeovers to date, and identifies the challenges to the task of regulating foreign takeovers presented by the effects of Brexit and the integration of AI into society. Section D establishes that there is a need for foreign takeover regulations in the UK to acknowledge social considerations, and reconceptualises the task of regulating foreign takeovers.

The purpose of the study is to describe the main features of the organization and functioning of the Masters programme in Civil Litigation and Dispute Resolution at the City Law School. To determine the level of scientific elaboration of the research problem, the method of analysis and synthesis of methodological, social, legal, scientific and methodical literature was applied. The method of generalization was used to formulate the conclusions of the article. The author observes that only a detailed study of the features of these specialisations, and in particular the training courses, suggests that they are directly related to the study of theoretical and practical issues of international arbitration. The programme suits existing legal practitioners as well as those who wish to work in the field of civil and criminal litigation, arbitration, international litigation and dispute resolution, legal services and tribunals. As it is domestic and internationally focused, it is interesting to students from the UK, Europe and around the world. Those who complete the LLM will demonstrate original application of knowledge to select and advanced legal issues, and in choice of approaches to legal practice. Students are engaged in research or scholarly activity that contributes to creative thinking and intellectual development in legal solutions.

        "abstract": "Maligni melanom spada u zlocudne tumore koji nastaje preobrazbom melanocita. Najcesce se pojavljuje na koži, no može nastati i na drugim dijelovima tijela koji sadrže melanocite (respiratorni, urogenitalni, gastrointestinalni trakt, oci, limfni cvorovi i moždana ovojnica). Incidencija melanoma posljednjih nekoliko desetljeca u svijetu znacajno raste, pa tako i u Hrvatskoj. Godisnje povecanje oboljelih je oko 7%. U Republici Hrvatskoj godisnje se otkrije oko 587 novooboljelih od melanoma. Melanom nastaje na nepromijenjenoj koži ili iz prekursorskih lezija, a najveci maligni potencijal imaju divovski urođeni i displasticni nevusi. Uglavnom se pojavljuje u osoba srednje životne dobi svijetle puti koji su cesto izloženi suncu i koji imaju gensku sklonost određene mutacije gena. Sumnju na melanom trebalo bi postavit kada se na koži nalazi pigmentirana lezija koja se mijenja tijekom vremena. Melanom je najcesce tamne boje, od smeđe do crne, no može biti i bez pigmenata. Melanom prolazi kroz tri faze rasta: melanoma in situ (oznacava fazu pojave malignih melanocita u epidermisu), radijalna faza (oznacava fazu lateralnog sirenja) i vertikalna faza (oznacava fazu invazije dermisa). Prema klinickim znacajkama i histoloskoj slici razlikujemo 4 glavna tipa maligni melanoma: lentigo maligna melanom – LLM, povrsinsko sireci melanom – SSM, nodularni melanom – NM i akralni lentiginozni melanom – ALM, U otkrivanju ranih melanoma najvažniji je klinicki i dermatoskopski pregled, a dijagnoza se potvrđuje patohistoloskom analizom odstranjene pigmentirane lezije. Najvažniji prognosticki faktori su debljina lezije (klasifikacija po Breslowu) i dubina invazije tumora po Clarku, a danas se najvise koristi sustav stupnjevanja prema AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer). Ukoliko se melanom dijagnosticira u ranoj fazi, u visokom postotku uspjesno se lijeci kirurskom ekscizijom. Ako se u regionalnim limfnim cvorovima dokažu metastaze, izvodi se i disekcija limfnih cvorova. Osim kirurgije u lijecenju melanoma koriste se kemoterapija, radioterapija, biokemoterapija, a dolaskom ciljane terapije melanoma te imunoterapije pocela je nova era u lijecenju metastatskog melanoma. Primjenom imunoterapije bolesnici sa metastatskim melanomom dobivaju na dužini i na kvaliteti preživljavanja. U usporedbi sa skromnim ucincima kemoterapije i zracenja bolesnici lijeceni imunoterapijom mogu preživjeti cak i vise godina, a odgovor bolesnika na terapiju krece se do 50%. Uloga medicinske sestre kao dio zdravstvenog tima je od neprocjenjive važnosti u skrbi za onkoloskog bolesnika. Nuspojave imunoterapije su brojne i nose sa sobom niz medicinskih dijagnoza. Medicinska sestra nakon razgovora s bolesnikom i prikupljenih podataka izrađuje plan zdravstvene njege sa sestrinskom dijagnozom, postavlja ciljeve, 2 planira intervencije, prati stanje bolesnika, evaluira napredak te evidentira u sestrinsku dokumentaciju. U bolesnika oboljelih od melanoma važno je provoditi kontrolne klinicke preglede te pridržavati se svih oblika fotozastite. Kako bi se smanjila incidencija melanoma, bitno je promicati mjere prevencije koje ukljucuju samopregled madeža, pregled dermatologa, izbjegavanje sunca, nosenje naocala (koje stite od UV zraka) adekvatna odjeca, koristenje zastitnih pripravaka.",

        "title": "OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IN BRAZIL",
        "abstract": "Judicial review of the legislative process has been a controversial topic in the case law of the Federal Supreme Court in Brazil. Issues regarding enacted statutes are not as controversial as those involving pending processes. On one hand, the Court has been scrutinising cases based on procedural legislative rules that are enshrined in the Constitution. On the other, the Court has been refusing to examine procedures based on provisions not enshrined in the Constitution, such as the internal ordinances of the parliament. In the former situation, the Court sees itself compelled to perform a kind of prior control of constitutionality. In the latter, it states that evaluating whether the process abides by the parliament’s own rules is an internal political (interna corporis) task, not a legal one. In this article, I argue that adherence to rules that govern the legislative process, regardless of their status, is not a matter of political discretionary choices, but a matter of compliance with the rule of law. Therefore, the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court should abandon the prior control of constitutionality rationale, and it should review pending legislative processes including those based on the internal ordinances of the parliament. A. INTRODUCTION [The] parliament, by virtue of its whole nature, cannot successfully be made subject to obligations.1 Among the different forms of judicial review, the courts’ scrutiny of the legislative process is one of the most contentious. Typically, arguments that flow from the separation of powers are invoked to keep the judiciary away from the parliament, particularly when the controlling standards are not enshrined in the Constitution. This is not different in Brazil, where there is little dispute concerning the appropriateness of judicial review that is based on legislative procedural rules enshrined in the Constitution, and which either lead to the invalidation of a statute or to an oversight labelled as prior control of constitutionality. In the latter case, the purpose is not to strike down a law (which has not yet come into existence), but to avoid a bill whose procedure does not comply with the Constitution from becoming law.

DOI: 10.14324/111.2052-1871.096 56 Federal Supreme Court (STF, acronym for Supremo Tribunal Federal) has been avoiding intervening in the legislative process when the litigation refers to the application of the parliament’s internal ordinances. Typically, the Court supports its decisions in such cases on the basis of interna corporis (internal affairs) arguments, according to which the procedures based on the Congress’ own provisions amount to political issues and, consequently, are immune from judicial examination. As an example, this position was stated in the MS 22503 (MS is the acronym for mandado de segurança, writ of mandamus), judged in May 1996.2 The case referred to alleged flaws regarding the passing of an Amendment to the Constitution whose purpose was the modification of the pension system. In opposition to the changes, some representatives filed a writ claiming that the President of the House of Representatives was not abiding by constitutional as well as internal procedural rules. In the judgement, the STF stated that the argument founded on the House’s rules was ‘an interna corporis matter, which could only be solved within the legislative branch and was not subject to the scrutiny of the judiciary’.3 Accordingly, it admitted assessing the case based on the Constitution, but refused to rely on the ordinances of the House (ultimately, the writ was dismissed). Concerning the judicial review of the legislative process (JRLP) in Brazil, I argue that the STF should review pending procedures even when the disputed issue is the application of an internal provision. Acting in this fashion, far from disrespecting the separation of powers, the Court may enhance participation and the flow of communication in the democratic process. Accordingly, I propose that the Court abandon the notion of a prior control of constitutionality. Additionally, I suggest that the Court reassess the interna corporis doctrine. In my view, the approach towards JRLP should not be based on the Constitution, but on the rule of law. From this perspective, alongside the constitutional provisions, the judiciary should rely on other legal texts while adjudicating cases wherein legislative procedures are at stake. Coupled with this approach, the Court should narrow its understanding of political questions to the ones related to discretionary choices, such as how public health care must be provided. Here, the aim is to draw attention to the fact that compliance with the internal rules does not belong to the political realm, but it is a matter of legality just as for the application of any statute. As these rules exist for organising the deliberative space, it is expected that their enforcement aid the democratic process by guaranteeing a minimal level of participation even to representatives that belong to 2 STF, Tribunal Pleno (Full Court), MS 22503, Relator para o Acórdão (Rapporteur for the Judgement) Maurício Corrêa, judged 8 May 1996 <http://redir.stf.jus.br/paginadorpub/paginador.jsp?docTP=AC&docID=85766> accessed 28 August 2017. 3 ibid 383 (in the original: ‘matéria interna corporis que só pode encontrar solução no âmbito do poder legislativo, não sujeita à apreciação do poder judiciário’; author’s translation).

Thus, grounded on the rule of law, the STF should enforce not only constitutional norms but also the Congress’ own rules as the most straightforward way of safeguarding the democratic nature of the law-making process. This paper is structured as follows. In section B, I will address the foundations of the justification of the type of JRLP I propose. I will clarify how the concept is to be understood under my proposal. Then I will show that the legislative process must abide by the rule of law to secure the legitimate expectations of those participating in the process. For this, I will draw upon the works of Hayek, Rawls and Raz. Moreover, I will address Ely’s and Habermas’ support of procedural judicial review in an attempt to link the monitoring of legislative procedures to the enhancement of democratic values. In section C, I will draw on similar reasoning used in other countries. I will start with doctrines that keep the judiciary away from the parliament, such as parliamentary sovereignty, exclusive cognisance and the enrolled bill rule, all resembling the interna corporis theory. Here, selected cases in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) will help assessing the issues at stake. I will then move on to interventionist approaches, grounded on the protection of rights, as in the case of Germany, or on the participation of the people, as in South Africa, while also criticising how the broadness of such approaches may result in too much intrusion in parliamentary affairs. Finally, I will address cases from Israel that resemble my conception of JRLP. In section D, I will describe the Brazilian situation and will argue in favour of the approach I think the STF should adopt. Section E contains concluding remarks. B. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS ‘Judicial review of the legislative process’ (JRLP) is a form of supervision of the legislature based on the ‘due process of lawmaking’.4 The breadth of this last concept varies in scholarship, but, overall, it can be said to relate to the production of law grounded on procedural rules or principles.5 The law, in this case, may be enacted either by the legislative or the executive branches.6 In addition, the rules involved may or may not be written and may enjoy either constitutional or sub-constitutional status, including the internal provisions of legislative 4 Ittai Bar-Siman-Tov, 'Separating Law-Making from Sausage-Making: The Case for Judicial Review of the Legislative Process' (Doctor of the Science of Law thesis, Columbia University 2011) 227-30. 5 For a broader version of the concept, encompassing notions such as participation, see Philip P Frickey and Steven S Smith, 'Judicial Review, the Congressional Process, and the Federalism Cases: An Interdisciplinary Critique' (2002) 111 The Yale Law Journal 1707, 1709-10.

        "abstract": "Oil sands fluid fine tailings, thickened tailings or sand–fines tailings mixtures have a lot of similarities with natural mud, sand–mud mixtures and soft soils commonly found in estuarine and coastal areas. While the specifics of oil sands operations are certainly different, the physics and physical processes at the basis of tailings treatment technologies (especially in the direction of tailings basins closure), and sediment management for land reclamation or coastal defense are very similar. In various regions of the world sediment management is becoming a critical matter for sustainable development: coastal regions and river banks are eroding exposing towns to more recurrent flooding; coastal development activities demand for large quantities of sediment as building material, or development of harbors for access to remote coastal regions. Similarly to fluid fine tailings management and tailings basin closure, these challenges indicate that smart, integrated and technologically advanced sediment (and tailings) management is critically necessary. With this in mind, EcoShape initiated the Living Lab for Mud (LLM) initiative. The LLM includes five pilots project in the Netherlands and Indonesia where innovative fine sediments knowledge and technologies are developed and tested in the field. These projects include utilizing dredge and natural sediments to: build islands for enhancing biodiversity; produce construction material for dykes reinforcement; and enhance the development of wetlands, salt marshes and mangroves. Similarly to oil sands tailings management, the underlying physic and processes at the basis of these pilots include: flocculation, dewatering and strength development (i.e. sedimentation, consolidation, drying and ripening); fines resuspension, fate and trapping; interaction of sediments with biota; and socio-economic",

        "abstract": "The health dimension of sustainable development and its limits in optimizing health protection has led to a rethinking of the management of shared water resources in international environmental law. This paper discusses human health in the sustainable development of shared waters and its limits using a case study of the sustainable management of the Lake Victoria Basin.

The health dimension of sustainable development has led to a rethinking of the management of shared water resources, and the case of Lake Victoria demonstrates this. Attempts to integrate health concerns into the sustainable management of Lake Victoria face challenges because the substantive legal regime for tackling health issues and its implementation has been weak. This paper argues for reinvigorating the centrality of health in sustainable environmental management of shared water resources. Health, environment, and natural resources are interdependent and key aspects of sustainable development., Man-made and natural capital (i.e., health, flora, and fauna) complement each other. As a result, new tools for sustainable health and safety risk assessment integrate human health, ecosystem integrity, and economic concerns. 3 The Rio Declaration reflects the shift towards an anthropocentric approach to environmental law, declaring that \"human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development.\" 4 International human rights law also recognizes the right to a healthy environment, culminating in the recent adoption by the U.N. General Assembly of the human right to water and sanitation. 5 Several global and regional legal instruments incorporate sustainable development. But it is argued that the social pillar of sustainability, which includes health, is not firmly embedded in sustainable development law, despite this concept promoting human health. On the other hand, these instruments have not effectively integrated or implemented health protection. The legal regime for sustainable management of Lake Victoria (Lake) reflects this trend. This paper is comprised of six parts. Part I focuses on the problematic posits of human health in international environmental law and policy. Part H provides an overview of the environmental health crisis facing the Lake Victoria Basin (Basin) in a global context. Part Ill presents applicable international law relating to sustainable development, examining its health protection potential in the context of water resource management. Part IV examines the East African community's legal regime for the governance of Lake Victoria in international and comparative legal contexts. Part V is a critique of the health and sustainability of the governance mechanisms for the Basin. Part VI provides conclusions and considers the implications for policy development. B.

        "title": "Performance Analysis and Application of Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage in a Power System",
        "abstract": "Delivering an adequate amount of power to electrical equipment is being a tough job due to the continuous upgradation and technological advancement in the equipment. One of such familiar challenging technology adapted nowadays in power system for some specific applications is termed as pulsed power technology. The electrical grid with pulsed power loads is of the significant interest in aerospace and marine applications. Keeping in the mind of pulsed power applications, especially in defence sectors, the Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage (SMES) system is proposed for a smooth and reliable power flow in the grid. In SMES system, the PCU interfaces the SMES magnet and the AC system in order to give an efficient power exchange and high quality power flow. Power Converter Unit (PCU) of the SMES system consists of a bidirectional DC-DC converter and a three-phase Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) coupled with a common DC-link capacitor. The control schemes employed for both the VSI and DC-DC converter is intended to maintain a constant DC-link voltage. Particularly, the voltage across the DC-link capacitor is tightly regulated using a Dynamic Evolution Control (DEC) strategy instead of a PI controller for the DC-DC converter. Consequently, the DC-link voltage is maintained almost constant with a voltage regulation well below ±10% during a Pulsed Power Load (PPL) condition. Initially, the performance of the SMES system using a Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS) control algorithm is compared with that using a Synchronous Reference Frame (SRF) control technique. The comparison is presented to show the effectiveness of the SMES system for power quality improvement. Henceforth, the control scheme for the VSI is proposed based on the Modified SRF (MSRF). Similarly, DEC or PI control strategy is employed to generate appropriate switching pulses for the DC-DC converter. It has been observed that the PI in the inner loop of MSRF is found sluggish during the PPL. Thus, PI is replaced by the DEC scheme to provide a fast response to the PPL. Also, the DC-DC converter employs the DEC instead of a PI in order to achieve a less rippled coil current and uniform voltage distribution across the SMES coil irrespective of load profile. Consequently, it ensures a reduced and acceptable AC loss across the SMES system, and a symmetric voltage distribution across the coil. Moreover, the control performance of the DEC scheme is compared with that of the Proportional-Integral (PI) control technique. A uniform source current and power with minimum variations is maintained irrespective of the pulsed power load. A detrimental high rating stress on the system due to the load is substantially reduced by the proposed system. The DEC scheme is implemented for tight error regulation of the controlling parameters. The system supply current is found almost balanced, and its Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is found well below 5%. An effective PPL compensation and a symmetric and uniform voltage distribution across the SMES coil, are achieved due to the precise solid-state control. Nevertheless, it has been seen that the SAPF is incompetent under high PPL demands whereas the SMES system has shown excellent performance under such load conditions. Moreover, a comparative analysis has been made between the conventional SAPF and the SMES system under PPL and Nonlinear Load (NL) conditions, to check the effectiveness of the SMES system. The performance of the proposed system is presented by using Sim Power System (SPS)/MATLAB Simulink, and real-time digital simulator (i.e. Opal RT-Lab/ dSPACE-1104).",

However, there is no specific article in the penal code or in the rules of criminal procedure to clarify the process for handling cases in which a defendant claims to be insane. Furthermore, there are no clear evidentiary standards for what kinds of evaluations or evidence can prove lack of mental capacity due to mental illness.

        "abstract": "Although the diplomatic relations between Canada and Nigeria is almost six decades old, the nature of this bilateral relationship has not been the subject of rigorous academic research. While a recent body of research by international relations scholars has taken up the broad critical study of Canadian-African relations, a significant gap exists with respect to studies that focus on the context of Canada’s engagement with individual African countries. Against this background, this paper briefly examines the bilateral trade and investment engagements between Nigeria and Canada.

In this paper, we propose a new LLMS algorithm that has a better performance than the LLMS algorithm in terms of the convergence rate and at the same time solves the drifting problem in the LMS algorithm. This better performance is achieved by expressing the cost function in terms of a sum of exponentials at a negligible increase in the computational complexity. The convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. Also, a normalized version of the proposed algorithm is presented. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to those of the conventional LLMS algorithm and a Modified version of the Leaky Least-Mean-Square (MLLMS) algorithm in channel estimation and channel equalization settings in additive white Gaussian and white and correlated impulsive noise environments.",

        "abstract": ": Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) in combination with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) can provide spectrally efficient and ISI free communication. Channel estimation is of great importance in order to recover the signal at the receiver side. Therefore accurate channel state information is essential for proper detection and decoding in MIMO-OFDM wireless systems. To estimate channel state information various types of techniques are being deployed in these systems. Accuracy and precision of channel estimation depends on the techniques used for the purpose of estimating channel state information. The more the accuracy of the technique, more will be the accurate performance of the system. In this paper an enhanced adaptive channel estimation using RLMS technique has been purposed. It is the combination of LMS and RLS algorithm. This technique provides better performance which can be judged by the BER performance. Comparison of the technique is done with the simple LMS and LLMS which is the combination of two LMS algorithms. Simulation results show that the purposed algorithm outperforms the latter algorithms. BPSK and QPSK modulations are used for analysis purposes.",

        "abstract": "On 23 February 2017 the Student Finance Law Club at the Faculty of Law of the University in Bialystok organized the conference entitled “Financial institutions as a workplace for lawyers”. The issue concerned different perspectives of financial institutions and developing the activity of academic circles in the Faculty of Law in Białystok. The key questions was: what next after graduation? Before the main part of the conference, the members of the Student Finance Law Club presented their papers. Introductory report was delivered by Adrian Szorc, a 5th year student of law, entitled: “Banks as financial institutions”. The next subject “Polish Intelligence Agency as financial institution financed from the state budged – the legal basis and the characteristics of individual services” presented Patryk Zabrocki, a 5th year student of law. Further, Magdalena Olchanowska, a 3rd year student of law, presented “Supreme Chamber of Control as a workplace for lawyers”. Marta Maksimczuk, a 3th year student of law presented “Voivodship Funds for Environmental Protection and Water Management as a workplace for lawyers”. Patrycja Marczak, a 5th year student of law, in her paper outlined the new reform in Poland changing Fiscal Chamber to National Fiscal Administration. The initiative undertaken by Student Finance Law Club was aimed at various financial institutions as opportunities for a future work after finishing law studies. The conference was officially opened by LLM Ewa Lotko. She welcomed the guests and all the participants and briefly explained discussed topics. Next part were the speeches of invited guests Mrs. Barbara Chilińska, Director of the Białystok Department of the Supreme Chamber of Control, Mr. Stanisław Srocki, President of the Regional Audit Chamber in Bialystok and Mr. Wojciech Orłowski, acting Director of the Fiscal Chamber in Bialystok. Mrs. Chilińska outlined current aspects of working in Supreme Chamber of Control. Mr. Stanisław Srocki gave an overview of the recruitments of Regional Audit Chamber. He also mentioned the candidates requirements and what the work in the chamber involves. In his speech, Mr. Wojciech Orłowski, presented the method of application for posts in the Fiscal Chamber. After of our guests’ speeches the discussion started. Students asked a lot of questions about the details and they were especially interested in the advice for their first step after graduation. Then LLM. Ewa Lotko summed up and closed the conference. Finally, she thanked the guests and all the members for their arrival and active participation. This conference was a great opportunity for students to get information about what they can do if they will not choose pupilage.",

        "title": "Canadian-Anglophone African Human Rights Engagement: A Critical Assessment of the Literature on Health Rights",
        "abstract": "Contrary to common expectations, the engagement between Canada and Anglophone African countries on the issue of health rights has not been a “one-way-street” whereby Canada is the “giver” and Anglophone African countries are the “takers” of health benefits. This article, which undertakes a preliminary and critical assessment of the literature documenting this engagement, finds that both Canada and Anglophone African countries have mutually benefitted from their engagement in the area of health rights. These benefits have taken the form of Canada’s financial and technical contributions to various initiatives that seek to improve the availability and accessibility of health-related goods and services in some Anglophone African countries. Canada has benefitted from the significant influx of highly skilled health workers from Anglophone African countries. However, by framing an agenda for research in this area, this article identifies the attainments, problems, and prospects of this engagement. This article further argues, amongst other things, for a recalibration of this engagement to ensure its sustainability, and to ensure that it advances the objectives of universal health coverage in the health systems amongst Canada and Anglophone African countries alike. 1.THIS ARTICLE SETS OUT to critically assess the literature documenting the nature, attainments, problems, and prospects of Canada’s engagements with the countries of Anglophone Africa in the area of health rights. In international discourse, health rights are known by the short hand phrase “the right to health”. This right derives principally from Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which defines the right to health as, amongst other things, “...the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.” Apart from the ICESCR, a number of other international treaties also guarantee the right to health in international law. In doing so, these treaties advance this right both for different * Sessional Lecturer (Health Law & Policy), Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia; LLM (Lagos), LLB (Jos), BL; email: uche.ngwaba@gmail.com. 1 Virginia A Leary, “The Right to Health in International Human Rights Law” (1994) 1:1 Health & Hum Rts 24 at 26. 2 16 December 1966, 993 UNTS 3 art 12 (entered into force 3 Janaury 1976). 3 Ibid. 189 TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEW [VOL.4] categories of people, such as women and children, and within different geo-political settings, such as the African Union system and the Organization of American States. All of the international instruments, which guarantee the right to health, are referred together in this article as “the treaty framework.” It is noteworthy, however, that the understanding of the right to health which informs the discussion in this article derives from the ICESCR and the work undertaken by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) with respect to its mandate of interpreting and monitoring states’ fulfillment of this right. The broader discourse on the nature and implementation of the right to health in international law remains quite controversial, especially in relation to a number of its key aspects including the following: its theoretical foundations; the identification of its meaning; the development of its content; and the issue of specifying the obligations 4 See Constitution of the World Health Organization, 22 July 1946, 14 UNTS 185 at Preamble (entered into force 7 April 1948) [WHO 1946]; Universal Declaration of Human Rights, GA Res 217A (III), UNGAOR, 3rd Sess, Supp No 13, UN Doc A/810 (1948) art 25; International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 16 December 1966, 993 UNTS 3 art 12 (entered into force 3 Janaury 1976); Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 18 December 1979, 1249 UNTS 13 art 12 (entered into force 3 September 1981); Convention on the Rights of the Child, 20 November 1989, 1577 UNTS 3 art 24 (entered into force 2 September 1990); African (Banjul) Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, 27 June 1981, OAU Doc CAB/LEG/67/3 rev 5, 21 ILM 58 art 16 (entered into force 21 October 1986); International Conference of American States, American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, OAS Res XXX (1948) art XI; Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \"Protocol of San Salvador\", 17 November 1988, 69 OASTS art 10 (entered into force 16 November 1999). 5 For literature that rejects the view that the right to health has a conceptual foundation, see James Griffin, On Human Rights (New York: Oxford University Press, 2008); Philip Barlow, “Health Care is not a Human Right” (1999) 319:7205 Brit Med J 321; Griffin Trotter, “No Theory of Justice Can Ground Health Care Reform” (2012) 40:3 JL Med & Ethics 598; Onora O'Neill, “The Dark Side of Human Rights” (2005) 81:2 Intl Affairs 427.

A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE LITERATURE IN HEALTH RIGHTS imposed on State parties to fulfill it. A major source of this controversy arises from the fact that health has been broadly defined in the Constitution of the World Health Organization (WHO) as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” This definition has been the subject of intense criticism in the literature because of the inclusion of the notion of “social well-being”, amongst other things, thus making “the enduring problem of human happiness one more medical problem to be dealt with by scientific means.” Despite these controversies, the CESCR has clarified through General Comment 14 (the most authoritative interpretation of the right to health in international law), that the right to health is not to be understood as a right to be healthy. On the contrary, it is a right containing both freedoms and entitlements: The freedoms include the right to control one’s health and body, including sexual and reproductive freedom, and the right to be free from interference, such as the right to be free from torture, non-consensual medical treatment and experimentation. By contrast, the entitlements include the right to a system of health protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest attainable level of health. General Comment 14 notes further that “in all its forms and at all levels,” the right to health contains “interrelated and essential elements” that have to be applied by each state on the basis of prevailing conditions. It identifies these elements as availability (i.e. functioning public health and health facilities, goods, services, and programs in sufficient 8 CESCR, General Comment No 3: The Nature of States Parties' Obligations (Art 2, Para 1, of the Covenant), 5th Sess, UN Doc E/1991/23 (14 December 1990). 9 WHO 1946, supra note 4 at Preamble. 10 See Daniel Callahan, “The WHO Definition of 'Health” (1973) 1:3 The Hastings Center Stud 77 at 80. For other critiques of this definition, see Thana Cristina de Campos, “Health as a Basic Human Need: Would This Be Enough?” (2012) 40:2 JL Med & Ethics 251; Sissela Bok, “WHO Definition of Health, Rethinking the” in Kris Heggenhougen & Stella Quah, eds, International Encyclopedia of Public Health, 6th ed (San Diego: Academic Press, 2008) 590; Lawrence O Gostin, “The Human Right to Health: A Right to the ‘Highest Attainable Standard of Health’” (2001) 31:2 Hastings Center Report 29. 11 CESCR, General Comment No 14: The Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health (Art 12), 22nd Sess, UN Doc E/C.12/2000/4 (11 August 2000) at para 8. 12 Ibid at para 8. 13 Ibid at para 12.

Better tax policy can generate economic activity and lower the tax burden on individual taxpayers. Missouri Department of Revenue Director, Joel Walters, believes the current Missouri tax system can be changed in ways that would make it more simple, efficient, and fair. With this article, Director Walters seeks to engage Missourians in a dialogue about the strengths and weaknesses of the current tax policy environment in Missouri. The article comprehensively examines Missouri’s tax system by discussing a wide variety of topics including corporate income tax, alternatives such as the gross receipts tax, margin taxes, and the corporate franchise tax, as well as individual income taxes, earned income tax credits, sales and use taxes, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Quill, motor fuel taxes and specific targeted provisions currently in the Missouri tax law, and more. This article also summarizes recent tax policy discussions in Missouri and the legal framework of reforming the tax code. The Director’s ultimate goal is to drive a fact-based discussion of the challenges and options to ultimately create a best-in-class tax system that enhances Missouri’s tax system for all its citizens and businesses, and provides a model for state tax reform nationwide. 1.

[Vol. 1 2017 I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Tax policy matters. Tax policy impacts the everyday decisions made by individuals, families, and businesses throughout the state of Missouri. Tax policy is a gating issue when businesses consider where to locate or grow their operations. It is therefore critical that all those who engage in the discussion around the current and future tax environment in the state take the time to consider a balanced, fact based assessment of the situation and the options. This article is my way of putting the debate front and center with a broad review of the current tax policy environment in Missouri, its strengths and weaknesses, and suggestions of possible steps to be taken to optimize the state’s position by creating a simple, fair, low tax environment that competes and wins the battle to attract and retain economic activity, growth and jobs. My ultimate objective is to drive forward and participate in a debate that will ultimately lead to a package of tax reforms that benefit all citizens and businesses in the state of Missouri. Having been in the business of investment decisions for three and a half decades, I know the importance of a simple, fair and low tax policy. As the head of PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Inbound Tax Services Practice, I led the firm’s efforts to help foreign companies grow their businesses and create jobs in the U.S. by guiding them through the complicated federal tax code. Before that, I held senior finance executive roles including responsibility for global tax affairs at two multinational corporations: Vodafone and Diageo. I accepted my current position with the goal of leveraging my past experience in private practice in order to help policy decision makers design a 21st century tax system for Missouri. Building on the work of the Governor’s Committee on Simple, Fair and Low Taxes (“the Committee”), this article summarizes a great deal of input and data from a full spectrum of stakeholders to create a foundation for a high-quality debate. The key challenges of the current environment are highlighted to focus attention on where action is most critically required. Finally, a number of potential options have been identified for consideration. What this report does not do is make a recommendation on any individual component of overall tax reform in the state, or on the shape of a total package when fully enacted and implemented. All suggestions are merely that—suggestions for consideration. I look forward to working with all stakeholders to evolve these and other thoughtful ideas into a final plan. One final introductory comment. Each of us thinks about policy matters through the lens of our own experiences and this article surely reflects mine. I have worked hard to cite a range of opinions to ensure a fair review, but there are principles that guide me in my approach to tax policy that I put forward to the reader here because they influence the suggested areas for consideration:  Reductions in total tax burden, as well as finding the right balance as to who is taxed at what levels are the ultimate objective. Reductions in the total tax burden have positive impacts on the economic environment that will generate enhanced economic activity and increase tax revenue to the state. 2 The Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review, Vol. 1 [2017], Iss. 2, Art. 6 https://scholarship.law.missouri.edu/betr/vol1/iss2/6 No. 2] Walters; Tax Policy Reform 429  As enhanced revenues from tax reductions and enhanced overall tax environment are recognized, they should be returned as tax reductions to the citizens and businesses in the state to the maximum extent possible to create further economic momentum.  Traditional income taxes are a less efficient method of taxation from the perspective of both the economic impact and the jurisdiction’s revenue, as compared to broader economic activity based taxes, even if revenue or income based.  Incentives can be an effective way to attract specific business activities, but should be used in a very targeted way to drive public benefits and incentivize activities that would not happen without the incentive. They must also produce a positive return on the investment made.  Beyond targeted incentives, the best tax environments have particular characteristics in common, which are a low rate of tax applied to a broad base with minimal special provisions designed to pick winners and losers in chosen areas or industries.  Above all else, a tax system should pursue the goal of simplicity over complexity. Simplicity makes the environment more attractive to businesses and individuals alike, creating a level and fair playing field and lending itself to transparent and certain administration of the tax system. As mentioned, this article cites a broad range of views herein, including many that do not always agree with the principles stated above or my core views on tax policy. This diversity of views is intended to ensure the high quality of the debate. Throughout the process to come, we should include those perspectives even as we hold to our individual principles and the intent to enhance the tax and economic environment of Missouri to the benefit of all of its citizens. Only then will the process drive the thoughtful fact-based, thinking necessary to deal with this complex area. II. BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW On June 30, 2017, the Governor’s Committee on Simple, Fair and Low Taxes finished its duties and submitted its report (the “Committee’s Report”) to Governor Eric Greitens.3 The Committee’s report focused principally on tax credits and tax administration.4 Its recommendations are included in Appendix A. However, the Committee heard testimony and received evidence on a number of additional and far ranging tax-related topics, including corporate income tax, individual income 3.

Identify Missouri’s tax laws and policies that hinder economic growth; 2. Compare Missouri’s tax laws and policies to other states; and 3. Recommend a comprehensive plan, including legislation that would make Missouri’s tax laws and policies achieve “best-in-class” status.7 This article builds upon the research, testimony, discussion, principles, and process that the Committee developed and relied upon during its existence.

        "title": "Evaluating Canadian and South African Collaborative Human Rights Initiatives: A Preliminary Analysis and Research Agenda",
        "abstract": "South Africa’s now defunct, autocratic apartheid government was based on minority rule, racially discriminatory laws, and disregard for the fundamental human rights of almost all black people. At that time, Parliament was supreme and could do anything that it wished, including enacting laws that denied the vast majority of the population from the right to vote. This regime lasted until the 1990s when parliamentary supremacy was replaced by constitutional supremacy. The adoption of the Interim Constitution of South Africa in 1993 eventually paved way for, among other things, respect for the fundamental human rights of all peoples without any distinctions as to race. Importantly, the 1993 Constitution contained an enforceable Bill of Rights and proclaimed the supremacy of the Constitution. These provisions found their way in the 1996 Constitution. This Constitution was “developed using the Canadian Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms as a template” inspiration from its provisions. This paper seeks to study the human rights engagements between the Canadian government and Canadian NGOs with both government and civil society in South Africa from the early 1990s to date. 1.

The Canadian human rights movement has evolved over the years and the protection of human rights is now a prominent part of the policy and practice agendas of the state and society alike. Although Canadians started engaging with human rights issues way before the 1970s, it was specifically during this period that the struggle for human rights (in those terms) gained momentum, among other things, as a result of the replacement of the principle of parliamentary supremacy by human rights discourse. It is important to mention that the principle of parliamentary supremacy was also a pillar of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Despite its many important (and even critical) shortcomings, the rights of everyone in Canada, including Aboriginal peoples and visible minorities, are now better protected by the Canadian human rights system. It is also significant to mention that the current Canadian attitude towards the promotion and protection of human rights in South Africa is itself an even more recent phenomenon. Despite the fermentation of human rights within Canada in the 1970s and 80s, Canada did not play a positive role during that era in regards to the human rights struggle in South Africa. In 1962, Canada was reluctant to support international intervention in South Africa against the apartheid regime’s brutal and gross human rights violations against the vast majority of the black 3 It is said that civil and political rights are realized immediately, as they do not require funds from the government. On the other hand, it is said that socio-economic rights are realized on a progressive basis, as they depend on the availability of funds. 4 Government of the Republic of South Africa and Others v Grootboom and Others, 2001 (1) SA 46, 2000 (11) BCLR 1169 at para 21. 5 Dominique Clément, Will Silver & Daniel Trottier, The Evolution of Human Rights in Canada (Ottawa: Canadian Human Rights Commission, 2012) at 4, online: <www.chrc-ccdp.ca/sites/default/files/ehrc_edpc-eng.pdf>. 6 Cheryl Saunders & Anna Dziedzic, “Parliamentary Sovereignty and Written Constitutions in Comparative Perspective” in Asanga Welikala, ed, The Sri Lankan Republic at 40: Reflections on Constitutional History, Theory and Practice (Colombo: Centre for Policy Alternatives, 2012) online: <republicat40.org/wpcontent/uploads/2013/01/Parliamentary-Sovereignty-and-Written-Constitutions.pdf>. CANADIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN COLLABORATIVE HUMAN RIGHTS INITIATIVE population. The apartheid government suppressed the fundamental human rights of almost all black South Africans. At the time, the Canadian government viewed this brutal suppression of human rights as an internal affair that required no external intervention. Canada went so far as to rely on the principle of state sovereignty in order to justify its non-interference in the domestic affairs of South Africa. Further, and as correctly noted by Yves Engler: ... Pierre Trudeau’s government (1968-1984) sympathized with the apartheid regime [and] not the black liberation movement or nascent Canadian solidarity groups. Throughout Trudeau’s time in office, Canadian companies were heavily invested in South Africa, enjoying the benefits of cheap black labor.... This observation cannot be taken lightly, as the vast majority of black South Africans were forcibly removed from rural areas to provide cheap labor in the solid mineral mining industry and other sectors in Johannesburg. Even during the late 1970s, as it became clear that apartheid was no longer sustainable and that signs of both liberation and civil war were imminent, Canada continued to sell weapons to the apartheid regime. In Engeler’s words, [o]fficially, the Trudeau government supported the international arms embargo against South Africa. But his government mostly failed to enforce it. As late as 1978 Canadiangovernment financed weapons continued to make their way to South Africa. Canadair (at the time a Crown company) sold the apartheid regime amphibious water bombers, which according to the manufacturer, were useful particularly in internal troop-lift operations. It is important that this history not be forgotten. For as George Santayana once proclaimed, “those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” All in all, Canadian foreign policy favored state sovereignty to the detriment of human rights in South Africa. 7 See Clément, Silver & Trottier, supra note 7 at 14. 8 AZAPO, supra note 1. 9 Clément, Silver & Trottier, supra note 7 at 14. 10 Yves Engler, “Canada’s Role in the Apartheid Struggle” Counterpunch (10 December 2013), online: <www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/10/canadas-role-in-the-apartheid-struggle/>. 11 Ibid. 12 George Santayana, The Life of Reason: The Phases of Human Progress (Auckland, New Zealand: The Floating Press, 2009) at 312. 13 Paul Gecelovsky, and Tom Keating, \"Liberal Internationalism for Conservatives: The Good Governance Initiative\" in Nelson Michaud & Kim Nossal, eds, Diplomatic Departures: The Conservative Era in Canadian Foreign Policy, 1984-93 (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2000) 194. 223 TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEW [VOL.4] However, this is no longer the position. The Canadian government, both as a government and via other agents, has supported several human rights initiatives in South Africa since the collapse of the apartheid regime. For example, the Canada Fund for Local Initiatives (CFLI) financially supports various human rights initiatives in many African countries, including South Africa. The aim of this article is to offer a preliminary analysis of Canadian and South African human rights engagements post-1994 and to call for further research in this area. A desk review method was adopted for this preliminary work and it suggests that there is a dearth of literature on this topic. Therefore, it will be necessary in the future to conduct much deeper and broader research on this topic, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods. II.

        "abstract": "This article examines the historical background of human rights in Tanzania and the ways in which Canada has been engaging with Tanzania on the improvement of human rights. In the past, Tanzania was ruled by colonial powers, for which respect for human rights was never a priority. Having attained independence in 1961, however, the country did not adequately respect human rights. This is in part due to the argument that, if the British themselves did not practice it, then independent Tanzania should not be forced to. Furthermore, the introduction of human rights at the time held the potential to paralyze the struggle for nationalization. It was not until 1984 that the country included a bill of rights into its Constitution as a result of mounting pressure from the Tanganyika Law Society. Despite the fact that the country has a bill of rights and works towards the achievement of human rights, the attainment of these rights necessitates financial support from donors, such as the aid that Canada has provided thus far. Canada has given attention and support to areas such as education and women and children’s rights. Nevertheless, the article suggests that more attention should be given to other human rights areas to ensure that citizens can fully enjoy their rights. 1.CANADA AND TANZANIA began their diplomatic relations in 1961, just after Tanzanian’s independence in 1961. This relationship has continued to this day, with Canada supporting Tanzania in the execution of various development projects, many of which touch on human rights. The purpose of this article is to discuss Canadian-Tanzanian engagements in the area of human rights. Since little, if any, scholarly work has focused directly on this important subject, this article is necessary and timely. The article is divided into four parts. Part I introduce the article and offer some background on the history of Tanzania. Part II discusses current trends in * Lecturer, Iringa University, Iringa, Tanzania; LLM (University of Birmingham UK), LLB (Tumaini University, Iringa University College); email julena.8@gmail.com 1 Government of Canada, High Commissioner for Canada in Tanzania, Canada-Tanzania Relations, online: <www.canadainternational.gc.ca/tanzania-tanzanie/bilateral_relations_bilaterales/canada_tanzaniatanzanie.aspx?menu_id=7&lang=eng accessed>. 71 THE TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEW [VOL.4] the human rights area in Tanzania. Thereafter, Part III focuses on Canadian-Tanzanian human rights engagements. Part IV concludes the article. As a colony, Tanzania (formerly known as Tanganyika) was under the administration of the Germans between 1885 and 1919, after which the British became the trustees of the territory between 1919 and 1961. During this era, human rights were not, for the most part, observed because they were considered to contradict the aims of colonialism. Even after its independence, a concern for human rights (read as civil and political rights) was mostly resisted by the new Indigenous Government which argued, for instance, that it would not entrench a Bill of Rights in the Tanzanian Constitution because the absence of a bill of rights does not necessarily lead to a lack of respect for human rights (as was the case for hundreds of years in Britain). Furthermore, the social priority of the new government was the success of its policy of nationalization and Africanization. Accordingly, certain human rights claims were not high on the state’s agenda. The case of Hatimali Adamji v EAPT Corporation provides a good illustration of this point. Here, Adamji’s claim was that his forced retirement from employment as a result of the Africanization policy of the newly independent Tanzanian Government violated the Constitution’s reference to a prohibition on racism. The plaintiff lost the case, however, as the court argued that since the Preamble was not part of the operative portions of the Constitution, it was not therefore part of the law of the land. It was not until 1984 that a bill of rights was incorporated into the Constitution of the country. Pressure from the Tanganyika Law Society and other sources encouraged the government to eventually agree to include a bill of rights in the Constitution.

Michael Wambali, “The Enforcement of Basic Rights and Freedoms and the State of Judicial Activism in Tanzania” (2009) 53:1 J Afr L 34 at 35 CANADIAN-TANZANIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ENGAGEMENTS Tanzania has ratified many human rights conventions (and passed many pieces of related legislation), some which include the following: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and People’s Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, to mention a few. II. CURRENT TRENDS IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS AREA IN TANZANIA A. THE RIGHT TO LIFE The Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania (last amended 1985) provides for the right to life. Despite the existence of this right, certain categories of people in Tanzania continue to face serious challenges in regards to their right to life because of their status within their communities. For instance, small minorities among those Tanzanians who believe in witchcraft have too often killed people living with albinism, and the state has made great efforts to arrest 6 18 December 1979, 1249 UNTS 13 (entered into force 3 September 1981). Tanzania signed this convention in July 1980 and ratified it in August 1985. 7 20 November 1989, 1577 UNTS 3 (entered into force 2 September 1990). Tanzania signed this convention in June 1990 and ratified it in June 1991. 8 13 December 2006, 2515 UNTS 3 (entered into force 3 May 2008). Tanzania signed this convention in March 2007 and ratified it in November 2009. 9 19 December 1966, 999 UNTS 171 (entered into force 23 March 1976). Tanzania acceded to this covenant in June 1976. 10 11 July 1990, OAU Doc CAB/LEG/24.9/49 (entered into force 29 November 1999). Tanzania signed this convention in October 1998 and ratified it in March 2003. 11 African Union, 2nd Sess, 11 July 2003. Tanzania signed this protocol in November 2003 and ratified it in March 2007. 12 1977, art 14 (Tanzania). 73 THE TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEW [VOL.4] and punish those who are found guilty of such killings. Nevertheless, such killings remain common enough that albinos live in constant fear for their lives. Although it is of course true that the Tanzanian courts have sentenced some people to death by hanging for such killings, merely punishing a few perpetrators does not really address the real cause of the killings – i.e. a witchcraft-based belief that albinos are “potent medicine.” Imprisoning or executing some or even all of the killers after the fact will thus fail to get at the root cause of the problem. Rather the state needs to undertake a more effective communityawareness campaign about the right of every individual to live. The right to life is also challenged when it comes to the death penalty. The Tanzanian penal code retains the punishment of death by hanging to those who kill others, but human rights activists (especially the non-profit organization known as the Legal and Human Rights Centre) have been campaigning for the abolition of this punishment on grounds that it is inhumane. To date, Tanzania has not signed the Second Optional Protocol to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights on the Abolition of Death Penalty, but it could be wise to do so taking into consideration the fact that criminal investigation could lead to false conclusions and convictions. Most significantly, the state could end up hanging a wrongfully accused person, especially in a country like Tanzania that is more deficient than some others in forensic investigation expertise. There are some who will point out that that the last execution in Fumbuka Ng’wanakilala, “Tanzania to hang blood-drinking killer of albino girl” Reuters (17 July 2017), online: <www.reuters.com/article/us-tanzania-albino-idUSTRE66R3XP20100728?\\>. 14 “Tanzania: Bukoba Court to hang two for albino’s death” Metro Afrique (16 November 2016), online: <www.metroafrique.com/2016/10/28/tanzania-bukoba-court-to-hang-two-for-albinos-death/>. 15 Penal Code, RE 2002, C-16, s 25 [Tanzania]. 16 World Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), online: <www.worldcoalition.org/Legal-and-Human-Rights-Centre-LHRC.html>. 17 15 December 1989, A/RES/44/128 (entered into force 11 July 1991). 18 R v.

CANADIAN-TANZANIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ENGAGEMENTS Tanzania took place in 1994, so the likelihood of being executed is in practice very low. Nevertheless, one can argue that those who are in prison under a death sentence are being psychologically tortured just by awaiting their execution. B. RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES Tanzania has made significant efforts to ensure that the rights of persons with disabilities are protected. These efforts include the signature and ratification of the United Nations Convention on Persons with Disabilities, the optional protocol to this Convention, and the enactment of a domestic law that caters to the rights of persons with disabilities (PWDs). The Act has interesting provisions on how such persons should be treated, but the main problem has been with its implementation. There have been serious challenges when it comes to building friendly policies and infrastructure that will enable PWDs to access public services th",

        "title": "Canada-Botswana Human Rights Engagements: A Critical Assessment of the Literature and a Research Agenda",
        "abstract": "This article discusses the past and present of Canada-Botswana human rights engagements, offering an insight into their nature and significance. The article highlights that despite the absence of strong diplomatic ties between the two countries, there nonetheless have been significant human rights engagements. The engagements, though not entirely systematic or clearly defined in their focus, have certainly improved the human rights situation in Botswana. It is also noted that the sustainability of these engagements is questionable considering that the weak ties between the two countries have resulted in reduced Canadian funding to Botswana. In the end, the article emphasizes that there is a need to undertake extensive research on CanadaBotswana human rights engagements. This is so as to understand the nature and extent of the engagements, to measure their impact, and to use such research findings to inform future human rights engagements. 1. DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS between Botswana and Canada date back to 1966, the year in which Botswana gained its independence from British colonial rule. It appears that the relations between the two countries were and continue to be based on their “...common approach and commitment to human rights, freedom of expression, rule of law and democracy”. The assumption is that (at least in part) bi-lateral relations between the two countries should be geared towards the attainment of these common ideals. The bi-lateral relations between the two countries straddle many areas of state cooperation, such as trade and investment, and, most significantly, development assistance. This article is focused, however, on the human rights engagements between Botswana and Canada in Senior Lecturer & Head, Department of Law, University of Botswana, Gaborone, Botswana; LLD, LLM (University of Pretoria), LL.B (University of Botswana). 1 Government of Canada, Embassy of Canada to Zimbabwe, Canada-Botswana Relations, online: . 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 51 THE TRANSNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS REVIEW [VOL.4] pursuit of the common goals highlighted above. These engagements have been focused on many sub-areas of human rights, and over the years, Canada has supported a diverse range of human rights initiatives in Botswana (as in the rest of the African continent). In light of the dearth of literature on the subject of this article, research surrounding this area is important, as it will bring to the fore the nature and extent of the engagements between the two countries on matters relating to human rights, as well as their attainments, problems and prospects. In this sense, this article attempts to: (a) identify the (strategic) focus of Canada’s interest in human rights issues in Botswana; (b) consider their sustainability; and (c) investigate whether the two countries have drawn, or can draw, lessons from each other on how to deal most effectively with certain human rights issues that affect them both. A good example of such an issue is the treatment of indigenous peoples in both countries and the quest of indigenous peoples to achieve unhindered enjoyment of their human rights. A better understanding of the issues highlighted above is likely to be useful to policy-makers, academics, and practitioners who are interested in the human rights engagements between Canada and Botswana. The conclusions drawn from this article will thus provide insight into possible areas of further research. It is against this background that this article looks at the bilateral relations between Botswana and Canada, with a specific focus on their engagements in the area of human rights. Following this brief introduction, Part II of the article highlights the current human rights situation in Botswana with particular emphasis on the promotion and protection of the rights of marginalized groups in the country. Part III of the article discusses the evidence of CanadianBotswana human rights engagements. Part IV provides a critical reflection on human rights engagements. Part V draws some conclusions and makes recommendations. CANADIAN-BOTSWANA HUMAN RIGHTS ENGAGEMENTS II. THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION IN BOTSWANA The following discussion on the human rights situation in Botswana is put forward for two main reasons. First, it will provide a background to a later discussion in this article on human rights engagements. Second, and most importantly, the discussion will assist in a process of developing suggestions on ways of improving and making more effective future human rights engagements. Recently, there have been concerns that Botswana is not doing well vis-à-vis respect for the rule of law and human rights. This worry has had much to do with the fact that, as a dualist state, international treaty law does not become part of the laws of Botswana unless specifically incorporated into it through an Act of Parliament. As such, treaties creating rights and obligations for the inhabitants of Botswana do not, immediately upon their ratification, create rights and obligations that are enforceable in the courts. This concern is also rooted, in part, in the fact that the Constitution of Botswana is silent on the status of international (human rights) instruments. However, Section 24 of the Interpretation Act provides that such treaties may be used in the interpretation of the law where the wording of the statute is ambiguous. It is perhaps due to the declining levels of the promotion and protection of human rights in Botswana that countries like Canada have raised some concerns about human rights issues in Botswana. For example, during the Universal Periodic Review process in 2009, Canada offered some advice to Botswana regarding a number of such issues, including Botswana’s compliance with the 4 See generally Bonolo R Dinokopila, “Bringing the Paris Principles Home: Towards the establishment of a National Human Rights Commission in Botswana” (2012) 14 U Botswana LJ 45 at 46 (arguing that Botswana’s human rights record is declining due to the absence of sufficient human rights protection mechanisms) [Dinokopila, “Bringing the Paris Principles Home”]. See further Amelia Cook & Jeremy Sarkin, “Is Botswana the Miracle of Africa?

It is also perhaps necessary to highlight that Botswana has, in the past, made some recommendations to Canada during the UPR process. Botswana has congratulated Canada on the laudable efforts the country has taken in so far as the promotion and protection of human rights in concerned. Botswana has also encouraged Canada to strengthen measures aimed at eliminating racial profiling in law enforcement and employment. The following is a brief discussion on the promotion and protection of the rights of the following groups in Botswana: minority ethnic groups, women, refugees, people with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS, asylum seekers and immigrants, and members of the LGBTIQ community, among others. Other issues, such as the death penalty, are also highlighted. A. THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE MARGINALIZED PEOPLE IN BOTSWANA Minority ethnic groups such as the Basarwa continue to be marginalized by the current policies adopted by the Government. The Basarwa have been economically and politically marginalized from the time Botswana gained independence in 1966. They have, as a result, lost access to most of their traditional lands in fertile regions of the country and are vulnerable to exploitation by their non-San neighbors. Their relative isolation, limited access to education, ignorance of the nature of the textual affirmations of their civil rights, and lack of adequate political 7 Ibid. 8 See generally Report on the Universal Periodic Review: Canada, UNHRC, 24th Sess, UN Doc A/HRC/24/11(2013). 9 Ibid. CANADIAN-BOTSWANA HUMAN RIGHTS ENGAGEMENTS representation, also continue to hinder their ability to enjoy their human rights more fully. It has also been pointed out that: [a]llegations of torture of the Basarwa by members of the dominant group, coupled with an apparent indifference and reluctance to react to such allegations, indicate the extent to which the human rights of the Basarwa are violated mainly because their rights are not recognized. Despite legal protection under the constitution, practical protection is not guaranteed. Nevertheless, attempts by the Basarwa to challenge their forceful relocation from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) and the cessation of the provision of essential services by the Government have been partly successful in the past. In their challenge, the litigants in Sesana and Others v The Attorney General asked the Court to declare their relocations from the CKGR to settlements outside the Game Reserve to be unlawful. The litigants further asked the Court to order the Government to restore the provision of water, health services, and food to those peoples who refused to relocate and were still resident in the CKGR. The Government’s position was that the CKGR was a wildlife area and that the continued residence of people in the CKGR was incompatible with wildlife protection and social development. In the end, the Court found for the Gov",

        "abstract": "Carcinoma of the prostate gland is very common globally and majority of such tumours had been diagnosed in older men and hence many clinicians may be unfamiliar with the biological behaviour of the disease in the younger age group. Literature obtained from 39 references had revealed that more and more cases of carcinoma of the prostate gland are now being diagnosed in the younger age group. Cancer Research UK had documented that between 2011 and 2013, 474 cases of carcinoma of the prostate gland (1.06%) had been reported in males in the United Kingdom whose ages had ranged between 0 years and 49 years out of a total of 44,833 cases of carcinoma of the prostate gland reported in all age groups within the United Kingdom. In some cases of carcinoma of the prostate gland involving the younger men there had been a family history of the disease. A large number of cases of carcinoma of the prostate gland diagnosed in the younger age had been tumours of low-grade and low-stage which had tended to be associated with good prognosis in the long term. On the other hand carcinomas of the prostate gland that are diagnosed in younger men as higher staged/advanced tumours had tended to be associated with poorer long-term prognosis in comparison with similar higher-staged tumours in older men. Perhaps early detection of carcinoma of prostate in younger men by means of serum PSA testing of men with a family history of carcinoma of prostate and or other malignancies might help detect more prostate carcinomas at a lower stage which would enable clinicians guide the men regarding all the treatment options to enable the patients opt for the best opinion of treatment of their choice including active surveillance and curative treatment option of their choice. Younger men who are diagnosed with high-staged / advanced carcinomas of the prostate should be encouraged to enter a multicentre trial that would identify treatment options that would hopefully improve the long-term survival of their type of disease.

Introduction Primary adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland is a very common malignancy that is encountered globally year in year out and it tends to be associated with lots of morbidity and mortality. Other types of malignant neoplasms on rare occasions affect the prostate gland and these tumours tend to exhibit biological behaviours which tend to differ from the biological behaviour pattern of the classic and more common adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland. Some of these rare types of malignancies of the prostate gland include: small cell carcinoma of the prostate gland, [1] leiomyosarcoma of the prostate gland, [2] rhabdomyosarcoma of the prostate gland, [3] lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the prostate gland, [4] synovial sarcoma of the prostate gland, [5] angiosarcoma of the prostate gland, [6] sarcomatoid carcinoma (carcinosarcoma) of the prostate gland, [7] fibrosarcoma of the prostate gland, [8] lymphoma of the prostate gland, [9] squamous cell carcinoma of the prostate gland.

On the other hand generally adenocarcinomas of the prostate gland tend to be associated with raised serum levels of PSA. Adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland tends to affect older men more commonly; nevertheless, some young men occasionally are also affected by adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland. With the advent of increasing use of serum prostate-specific antigen tests men are being diagnosed as having adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland at an earlier age. Additionally, there has been the trend to investigate men with a family history of adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland to detect adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland at an earlier age when hopefully the carcinoma would be localized and amenable to treatment options of curative intent to enable such patients live longer. It is also known that not all adenocarcinomas of the prostate gland are aggressive and lead to death and based upon this it would be argued that some patients are undergoing overenthusiastic aggressive treatments that could be adjudged to be unnecessary and associated with lots of morbidity that affect the quality of life of these patients. A number of questions may be asked regarding the detection of adenocarcinoma of the prostate at an earlier age and some of these questions",

It is known that Aurora kinases are abnormally expressed in cancer cells. Therefore, they are seen as an important therapeutic target. CCT137690 is a synthetic aurora kinase inhibitor with high selectivity. In this study, it was aimed to determine apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of CCT137690 on KU812 cells (human chronic myeloid leukemia-CML). Patients and Methods: The cytotoxic effect of CCT137690 in KU812 cells was determined by WST-8. Effect of IC50 dose on apoptosis and on cell cycle was assessed with flow cytometry after using Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit I and BD Cycletes Plus DNA Reagent Kit, for apotosis and cell cycle, respectively.

        "abstract": "This paper examines the influence of the neo-liberal economic setting on taxation, and contends the enforcement of the arm’s length principle (ALP) as a measure to share taxing rights among jurisdictions in the era of the knowledge-based economy, grounded on a Polanyian critique of market liberalism. It outlines Polanyi’s main criticisms of laissez-faire economics and reviews the contemporary challenges faced by tax administrations. There is an analysis of the responses given to those problems by a number of experts, but the article makes the case for a coordinated action to uphold Corporate Income Tax. For a conclusion, the article rejects the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project’s proposal to enforce the ALP as a measure to allocate the tax base derived from the exploitation of intangibles. Without ignoring the mainstream critique regarding its feasibility, this paper looks at its desirability, claiming that its outcome will deliver a final blow to the hope for stronger social cohesion. \nThis article is based on a dissertation submitted to the London School of Economics and Political Science as part of an LLM degree obtained in 2016.",

        "abstract": "Objective: To report the survival of the refractory leukemia/lymphoma patients especially relapsing after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Patients and Methods: In this study we report fourteen patients who had relaps/refractory diseases and of the 7 (50%) whom underwent haploidentical HSCT as the second transplantation. The diagnosis were acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 6, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 6, Pro-T lymphoblastic lymphoma 1, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) 1. Eight (57%) of the patients had invasive pulmonary aspergillosis at the time of transplantation. For the ten of the fourteen patients cytoreductive chemotherapy was given before conditioning regimen.

LLM Dergi 2017;1(3):64-71 65 GİRİŞ İlk haploidentik kök hücre nakli (KHN) 1981 yılında uygulanmıştır (1). Otuz altı yıl sonra haploidentik KHN uygulamaları, özellikle son on yılda, çığ gibi büyüyerek tam uyumlu allojeneik KHN’lerle karşılaştırılabilir sonuçlara ulaşmıştır. Günümüzde malign refrakter hematolojik hastalıkların tek küratif tedavisi allojeneik KHN’dir. Başarılı olmanın ana unsurları uygun kemik iliği vericisini belirleyerek zamanında KHN yapmaktır. Son yıllara kadar en iyi kemik iliği vericisinin doku tipi tam uyumlu akraba verici (AV) ya da akraba dışı verici (ADV) olduğu kabul edilmekteydi. Ancak zamana karşı yarışan bu hasta grubu için doku tipi tam uyumlu verici bulunamadığında, en kolay ulaşılabilen hematopoietik kök hücre vericisi haploidentik kök hücre vericileridir. Tam uyumlu ADV ve haploidentik KHN’ler karşılaştırıldığında akut lösemili hastalarda benzer klinik etki saptanırken, graft versus host hastalığı (GVHH) oranları ve enfeksiyon sıklığında artış saptanmamıştır (2). Allojeneik KHN sonrası en büyük sorun relapsdır. Eğer hastalık relapsı ilk altı ayda gelişmişse toplam sağkalım (TS) oranı sadece %22’dir (3). Aynı vericiden ya da başka bir vericiden yapılacak KHN kemoterapi seçenekleri yanında küratif olabilecek tek tedavi seçeneğidir (4-6). Bu çalışmanın amaçlarından biri relaps refrakter hematolojik malignitelerde haploidentik KHN’nin hastalık yanıtı, GVHH ve sağkalım açısından incelenmesi iken, diğeri KHN’lerde haploidentik verici seçiminin etkilerini değerlendirmektir. HASTAlAR ve YÖNTEM Çalışmaya, Kasım 2012–Mayıs 2015 tarihleri arasında, Özel Medicana International Ankara Hastanesine başvuran 18 yaş üzeri 14 hasta dahil edildi. Lokal Etik Kurul onayından sonra hasta dosyaları geriye dönük olarak incelendi. Hastaların medyan yaşı 36 (19-58 yaş) ve 7 (%50)’si kadındı. Hastaların tümüne haploidentik KHN uygulandı. Haploidentik KHN > 2 HLA mismatch antijeni (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLADQDB1) uyumsuzluğu olarak tanımlandı. Haploidentik KHN sırasında hastaların tümünde refrakter hastalık mevcuttu. On dört hastanın 3 (%21.4)’ünde primer refrakter hastalık, kalan 11 (%78.6)’inde relaps refrakter hastalık mevcuttu. Hastaların 7 (%50)’sinde haploidentik KHN ikinci, 1 (%7.1) hastada üçüncü allojeneik KHN idi. Hasta ve verici özellikleri, hastalıktan birinci ve ikinci KHN’ye kadar geçen süre, HLA uyum özellikleri, NK alloreaktivitesi (Killer inhibitör KIR skoru), kan grup antijenleri ve anti-HLA antikor varlığı ile ilgili veriler Tablo 1’de gösterilmiştir. Komorbiditesi olan hasta sayısı 10 (%71.4)’du ve hastalardan 8 (%57)’i invaziv pulmoner aspergilloz nedeniyle antifungal tedavi almaktaydı. HlA Tiplendirmesi Tüm hasta ve vericilerde HLA DNA bazlı metotla belirlendi. HLA klas I (HLA-A*, -B*, -Cw*) ve klas II (DRB1*, DQB1*) moleküler tiplemesi için PCR-reverse sekans spesifik oligonükleotid prob (rSSOP) (Tepnel, UK) ve/veya SBT-sekans temelli tiplendirme (SSP) (Gen Dex, Netherland) ticari kitleri kullanıldı. Bu metotlar orta ve yüksek rezolüsyonlu tiplendirmeye olanak sağladığından aynı zamanda KIR ligandları da incelenebildi. KIR Skoru Yorumlanması Tüm hastalar inhibitör KIR skoru açısından incelendi. KIR skoru 1’den düşük olan hastaların, 1’den büyük olanlara göre tam verici kimerizmi (TVK) gelişme olasılığı düşük ve graft rejeksiyon riskinin yüksek olduğu yorumu yapıldı. Düşük inhibitör KIR skoru ise vericiye karşı immün efektör hücreler (NK ve T hücre alt tipleri) daha aktif olacağı şeklinde yorumlandı. Bu durumda verici kimerizminin düşük olacağı yorumu yapıldı. Tersine, inhibitör KIR skoru yüksek olanlarda NK ve T hücre grupları aktif olamayacak ve TVK sağlanabileceği yorumu yapıldı (7). Tüm hastalarda NK alloreaktivitesi www.ebi.uk adresindeki formül yardımıyla hesaplandı. Panel Reaktif Antikor (PRA) Analizi HLA spesifik antikorlar solid faz immunoassay kullanılarak Luminex platformda saptanmıştır. Verici Kimerizm Analizi Kimerizm analizi [Short Tandem Repeat (STR)] +28. günde kemik iliğinden, 60. ve 90. günlerde dolaşan kandan değerlendirilmiştir. Results: On the 30 day of transplantation seven of the 14 (50%) patients were alive. Overall survive (OS) on day 100 was 7 (50%). Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) were seen in 4 (28.5%) of the patients and of the 2 (14.2%) died because of GVHD. The number of patients who were alive without disease with full chimerism at the 6, 12 months were, 6 (42.8%), 3 (21.4%) respectively. Two (14.2%) patients are still alive at the 24 and 18 months without disease with full chimerism. Conclusion: Long term survival can be achieved in heavily pretreated hematologic malignancies by the help of haploidentical HSCT.",

        "title": "Exploring the Intersections between International and Domestic Justice Efforts: Introduction",
        "abstract": "IntroductionThe 2015-2016 academic year marked the twentieth anniversary of the War Crimes Research Office (WCRO) at American University Washington College of Law. The Office was established in response to a request for legal assistance from the first Chief Prosecutor of the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and Rwanda (ICTR), Richard Goldstone. Faced with bringing the first major international prosecutions since the Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crimes Trials following World War II, the ad hoc criminal tribunals found themselves at the forefront of international criminal law. The WCRO was originally created to assist these tribunals with the kind of specialized legal research and analysis that prosecuting cases of serious international crimes requires.In the twenty years since, the WCRO has worked with over fifteen different courts, tribunals, and organizations involved in the investigation and prosecution of serious international crimes, both at the domestic and international level. With the participation of our international law faculty, former and current WCRO staff, JD and LLM students, and expert consultants, the WCRO has undertaken more than 170 major research projects, including 19 public reports analyzing issues that have arisen in the practice and jurisprudence of the International Criminal Court (ICC).1 The WCRO has also launched several projects that have emerged as a result of our work with the tribunals. For instance, the Gender and International Criminal Law Project,2 created in partnership with WCL's Women and the Law Program, makes available, free of charge, an online collection of searchable documents from twelve tribunals dealing with the prosecution of conflict-based sexual and gender-based crimes.During these past two decades, practitioners and scholars in this field have seen an incredible number of advances. Media executives have been held accountable for incitement to genocide.3 High state officials - including, most recently, former Congolese vice-president Jean-Pi erre Bemba - have been found guilty of crimes of sexual violence, both as war crimes and crimes against humanity.4 Even heads of state have been prosecuted and convicted for atrocity crimes,5 challenging traditional notions of head-of-state immunity. For victims and the people on the frontlines, these advances have been painstaking, but if we look back, the milestones of the last two decades have been tremendous.At the same time, we have seen a perceptible shift in the field. The ad hoc tribunals created by the United Nations Security Council in the 1990s to deal with the atrocities committed during the Balkans conflict and the Rwanda genocide have closed or will be closing shortly.6 Similarly, a number of the so-called \"hybrid\" tribunals - such as the Special Panels for Serious Crimes in East Timor and the Special Court for Sierra Leone, set up with international support in the countries where the atrocities occurred - have come to the end of their respective mandates.7Significantly, we also now have a permanent international criminal court. As a permanent institution, the ICC8 will obviously play a critical role in the developing architecture of international justice. However, the ICC has significant limitations. First, the Rome Statute establishing the ICC does not yet enjoy universal ratification.9 Second, the ICC can only deal with crimes committed after the Statute came into force in 2002.10 Third, it has a potentially global mandate which it must carry out with finite resources,11 meaning that it can only realistically handle a limited number of cases. While the ICC will sometimes be the only option for holding certain perpetrators accountable - particularly where debilitated national institutions or an absence of political will makes domestic justice impossible - it cannot alone effect meaningful change in countries where atrocities have occurred. For the ICC to make a difference, it needs to be part of a broader set of accountability efforts. …",

        "abstract": "The significance of quality of life factors in end of life decisions cannot be overstressed. However, a plethora of case law shows that there are other factors which must be considered. The landmark cases of W v M and Others[1] and Airedale N.H.S Trust v Bland[2] indicate that autonomy and best interests of the patient must be given adequate consideration before making end of life decisions. The courts held that despite M’s minimally conscious state, dying was not in her best interests. However, in Bland where he had been in a persistent vegetative state, it was held that it was lawful for treatment to be withdrawn. This article gives a critical assessment of the disparities in both decisions and with the aid of other case law, examines the extent to which quality of life factors have influenced the decisions of the courts. Furthermore, it argues whether patient autonomy should override best interests and then it concludes that quality of life factors should influence end of life decisions to the extent of the patient’s autonomy or self-determination.  In other words, quality of life factors must be considered but respect for patient autonomy should be paramount.  * LLM Medical Law and Ethics Candidate, Kent Law School, University of Kent, tam36@kent.ac.uk[1] [2011] EWHC 2443 (Fam).[2] [1993] AC 789 (HL).",

        "title": "The Role of the ECOWAS in Addressing Challenges of Ineffective Regulation of Transnational Oil Corporations in Nigeria",
        "abstract": "The article explores the potential of a regulatory oversight role for the Economic Community of West African States (“ECOWAS”) aimed at driving further effectiveness of regulatory framework for transnational corporations (“TNCs”) in Nigeria. It reviews institutional and regulatory challenges that hinder effective protection of victims of environmental pollution and reviews specific regulatory concerns within the Nigerian regulatory framework which require reform. It argues that regulatory failures in Nigeria as well as the government’s attitude towards enforcing existing regulation justify the need for a regulatory oversight framework. The article is specifically concerned with problems relating to persisting oil pollution in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. It examines the implication of oil pollution on the environment, the Nigerian economy, and the Nigerian government’s responsibilities towards preventing or remediating oil pollution. The article identifies ineffective regulation as being primarily responsible for persisting oil pollution and transnational corporations as the major perpetuators of oil pollution in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The article thus interrogates the existing framework for regulation of Oil Companies in Nigeria, and reasons why such existing regulations are not effectively enforced, including the Nigerian government’s involvement in oil extraction and potential conflict of interest for enforcing existing regulation.  Rahina Zarma is a Ph. D Candidate at Osgoode Hall Law School, York University. This article is based largely on research carried out while pursuing an LLM Degree at the University of Saskatchewan. 304 ASPER REVIEW [VOL. XIX The research provides scholarly insight into challenges and consequences of ineffective regulation of TNCs in Nigeria while exploring the potential of a novel approach to addressing seemingly intractable challenges. It provides a useful contribution to identifying concerns relating to regulatory ineffectiveness in Nigeria, argues for regulatory reform of the existing framework for regulation, and proposes a framework under the ECOWAS to address challenges to regulatory effectiveness identified. I. SETTING THE CONTEXT n 2001, following an inquiry by the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights, the degree of environmental oil pollution in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria was described as “nightmarish” and “humanly unacceptable”. Several years after the Communication of the African Commission, the environmental pollution in the Niger Delta seemed unchanged and if changed at all, seemed to have only deteriorated. Environmental pollution and perhaps the activities of militant protesters of oil activities in the Niger Delta forced the Nigerian government in 2011 to request the United Nations Environment Program (“UNEP”) to investigate oil pollution in Ogoniland (one of the local communities in the Niger Delta) and make recommendations for the remediation of the effects of oil pollution on the region. UNEP’s Report was quite damning, providing details of pollution that had gone on for over 50 years, and recommended several measures for environmental restoration and alleviation of suffering on local communities. 1 The Niger Delta region is made up of 8 oil producing states in Nigeria. It consists of a total land mass of approximately 70,000 square kilometers, with a population of approximately 20 million people. See Damilola S.

Protein katabolizmasının kontrolünde, hormon sentezinin ve kemik resorbsiyonun düzenlenmesinde, inflamasyon, antijen sunumu ve T hücre bağımlı immün yanıt regülasyonunda rol almaktadır (2,3). Sistatin C’nin belirgin bir diurnal ritmi yoktur. Bütün çekirdekli hücrelerden sabit üretim hızı, renal glomerüllerden serbestçe süzülmesi ve hemen hemen tümünün proksimal tübüllerden geri emilmesi ve kreatininden farklı olarak vücut kas kitlesinden etkilenmemesi nedeniyle glomerüler filtrasyon hızı (GFR)’nın değerlendirilmesi için daha duyarlı bir parametre olduğu birçok çalışmada gösterilmiştir (4). Sistatin C’nin kanser dahil birçok hastalığın proteolitik sistem değişikliği ile ilişkili olduğu ve birçok malignitede de yüksek sistatin C düzeylerinin zararlı tümör ilişkili proteolitik aktiviteyi artırdığı ileri sürülmüştür (5). Kolorektal, akciğer, melanoma karsinomları, multipl miyeloma (MM) ve Hodgkin dışı lenfoma tanısı olan hastalarda, yüksek serum sistatin C seviyelerinin kötü prognozla ilişkisini gösteren çalışmalar vardır (6,7). Sistatin C’nin hepatosellüler kanser olgularında serum seviyesinin yükseldiği ve bir tümör belirteci olarak kullanılabileceği, nozofarengeal karsinomlarda da tanısal ve prognostik değer taşıdığı ve kötü prognostik bir belirteç olduğu bildirilmektedir (8,9). Seksen iki renal fonksiyonları normal sınırlarda olan kanser tanılı hasta ile sağlıklı kontrol grubunun karşılaştırmalı çalışmasında ise kanser grubunda sistatin C düzeylerinin yüksek bulunduğu, bu nedenle kanserli hastalarda renal fonksiyonları göstermede iyi bir belirteç olamayacağı sonucuna varılmıştır (10). İn vitro çalışmalarla da birçok tümör hücresinde sistatin C varlığı gösterilmiştir ve temel hücreden malign hücreye dönüşümün sistatinlerin ekspresyonundaki azalma ile ilişkili olduğu öne sürülmüştür. P-53 mutasyonu olan meme kanseri hücre dizilerinde sistatin C sunumunun azaldığı gösterilmiştir (11). Yine benzer bir çalışma özefagus karsinomu hücre dizilerinde yapılmış ve tümöral hücrelerde azalmış sistatin C sunumunun gösterilmesinin yanı sıra bunun özefagus karsinom hücrelerinin invazyon kabiliyetini inhibe edebileceği yönünde bir sonuç bildirilmiştir (12). Bu nedenle, sistatin C seviyelerinin malignite tanılı, normal renal fonksiyonları olan hastaların takibinde, kemoterapi yanıt değerlendirmede, hastalık sonuçlarını ve prognozu ön görmede kullanılabileceği yönünde görüşler vardır. Literatürde akut lösemi ile sistatin C düzeyleri arasındaki ilişkiye dair veri sınırlıdır. Türkiye’den yapılmış bir çalışmada 19 akut lösemi hastasının pretransplant ve posttransplant sistatin C düzeyleri araştırılmıştır. Bu çalışmada nefrotoksik ilaç kullanımı ile sistatin C yüksekliğindeki paralelliğe dikkat çekilmiştir (13). Biz de bu çalışmamızda; akut lösemi hastalarında, serum sistatin C düzeylerinin ne yönde etkilendiğini, serum sistatin C düzeylerinin tümör yükü, hastalık aktivitesi ve prognoz ile ilişkisini öngörmede kullanılabilecek bir belirteç olup olamayacağını ortaya koymayı amaçladık.",

        "title": "KAEDAH PELAKSANAAN SISTEM DIAT DALAM KES-KES KEMALANGAN JALANRAYA DI MALAYSIA; SATU TINJAUAN AWAL",
        "abstract": "Salah satu perkara yang menjadi topik besar di Malaysia sekarang ini ialah kadar kemalangan jalan raya yang sangat tinggi. Secara ringkasnya terdapat 2 isu utama dalam tajuk ini, iaitu isu kemalangan dan isu pampasan. Melihat kepada isu kemalangan, satu kajian oleh ESCAP (Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) iaitu satu badan di bawah kelolaan Pertubuhan Bangsa-bangsa Bersatu mengenai pembangunan alam sekitar di Asia Pasifik menunjukkan Malaysia mencatatkan jumlah kemalangan maut tertinggi di dunia dan tempat ketiga bagi kemalangan jalan raya secara umumnya. Satu kajian lain juga menunjukkan lebih 85 peratus punca kemalangan adalah disebabkan oleh sikap pemandu atau pengguna jalan raya itu sendiri. Berhubung isu pampasan, menurut statistik Ops Sikap 24, 62% daripada mereka yang terlibat dengan kemalangan maut adalah penunggang dan pembonceng motosikal. Rata-rata mangsa adalah masyarakat berpendapatan sederhana dan tidak memiliki insurans. Apabila berlaku kemalangan, mangsa akan menanggung kerugian kerana tiada pampasan untuk mangsa. Sekalipun mereka boleh menuntut pampasan melalui undang-undang Tort, namun ia terpaksa melalui proses yang berasingan dan memerlukan kos tambahan. Akibatnya mangsa kekal dalam keadaan menderita dan haknya terabai. Walaupun berbagai usaha telah dilakukan melalui pelbagai agensi kerajaan dan swasta seperti Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan (JPJ), Polis, Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia (LLM) dan lain-lain untuk membudayakan pemanduan berhemah, Namun masih belum menampakkan hasil yang memuaskan. Manakala dari aspek pampasan, boleh dikatakan belum ada satu kajian yang konkrit telah dilakukan. Justeru, kajian ini akan meninjau kelebihan sistem diat dalam menangani kedua-dua isu di atas  sekali gus merumuskan kaedah pelaksanaan sistem diat di Malaysia. Metodologi kajian berasaskan kaedah mix metode iaitu temubual pakar dan kajian tinjauan (survei). Sampel kajian terdiri daripada tenaga akademik, para mufti dan ulama,  peguam, ahli undang-undang dan orang awam. Teknik persampelan menggunakan kaedah purposive sampling dan simple random  sampling procedure. Data dianalisis secara deskriftif dan analisis SPSS. Dapatan kajian menunjukkan kesemua responden bersetuju sistem diat perlu diperkenalkan di negara ini dengan mewujudkan undang-undang bertulis yang lengkap serta melibatan semua agensi yang berkaitan bagi memudahkan proses pelaksanaannya. \n ",

        "abstract": "The Modified Leaky Least Mean Square (MLLMS) algorithm is used to mitigate the drifting problem of the Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS) algorithm. Though the LLMS algorithm solves drifting problem of Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm, its performance is similar to that of the LMS algorithm in which the result obtained for Bit Error Rate (BER) is 10 -3 to 10 -2.5 and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is 16 dB. In this paper, MIMO-OFDM system are used for 2x2 and 4x4 antennas for wireless communication system and which is implemented in MATLAB. The evaluation of Bit Error Rate (BER), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Mean Square Error (MSE) performance of the MIMO-OFDM technique based on comparative analysis of modulation schemes namely QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM over AWGN channel is been carried out using an improved version of the Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS) algorithm i.e. Modified Leaky Least Means Square (MLLMS) algorithm . Compared with Least Mean Square (LMS) and Leaky Least Mean Square (LLMS), Modified Leaky Least mean Square(MLLMS) algorithm gives better performance than the LLMS and LMS algorithm with obtained results of Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) from 15 to 5dB and Bit Error Rate (BER) from 0.96 to 10 -1 and similarly solves the problem of drifting in the LMS algorithm. This better performance is achieved at a negligible increase in the computational complexity. The performance of the MLLMS algorithm is compared to that of the conventional LLMS algorithm and LMS algorithm to show the better performance of MLLMS algorithm.",

        "title": "Price reduction vs Damages : a Battle without a",
        "abstract": "Damages is considered the primary remedy in English sales law. This remedy has been adopted in the CISG too. However, price reduction seems to be of higher importance than damages in the latter legal regime, while the SGA has excluded the remedy of price reduction. It remains unanswered whether it is time for English law to introduce price reduction in the SGA so that it can add significantly practical advantage to the current remedies available to a commercial buyer. This article seeks to explore the appropriateness of price reduction in comparison with its leading competitor, i.e. damages. To do this, the article examines the distinctions between damages and price reduction against a novel evaluative framework, which provides an appropriate mechanism for analysis of the relationship of doctrine to commercial utility necessary for the buyer. This framework consists of four norms: certainty, performance interest, efficiency and relational theory of contract. However, it proves difficult to determine which remedy could most effectively address and satisfy the particular needs of a commercial buyer. Damages is likely to provide very similar practical solutions to price reduction once a sales contract is breached. This may constitute the reason why the SGA excluded price reduction in business to business transactions and that no serious attempt has been carried out to include this remedy within this legal regime.  Dr Reza Beheshti, LLB, LLM, PhD, Lecturer, University of Leicester, School of Law, University Road, Leicester, UK.

        "title": "From the SelectedWorks of Alex Ansong 2015 Is Traditional Knowledge Intellectual Property ?",
        "abstract": "Traditional knowledge has become one of the areas of increasing interest in national and international fora, and in academia in recent years. Issues of protection of traditional knowledge from extinction and piracy and the possible extension of intellectual property rights (IPRs) to protect it are some of the pivotal issues in current international and domestic discourses. This article presents an exploration of the topic: ‘is traditional knowledge intellectual property? It begins with a very brief analysis of the concept of property. This sets out the general conceptual framework of the idea of property. It establishes the principles of ‘use’ and ‘exclusion’ as foundational in the general concept of property. The discussion builds upon this and undertakes a panoramic historical overview of intellectual property, its scope and some of the justifications that have been adduced in the defence of IPRs. The principles of ‘use’ and ‘exclusion’, are reemphasised in the discourse on Intellectual property to show that it is a subset of the general concept of property. After setting out the foundational arguments on property and intellectual property, the article considers the conceptual framework of traditional knowledge and undertakes a comparative study of traditional knowledge and intellectual property. The import of this comparative study is to ascertain whether there are any common grounds between the two systems that can allow the extension of intellectual property protection to traditional knowledge. The principle of ‘use’ and ‘exclusion’ reverberates again in this segment of the discussion and analysis. Foundational arguments are also presented on the issue of whether proprietary rights can be instituted in traditional knowledge and whether existing intellectual property regimes can be extended to traditional knowledge. These arguments are used in the concluding part of the article to support the position that traditional knowledge is intellectual property. I. The Concept of Property The idea of property has engaged the minds of political, legal, economic and social theorists for centuries and different schools of thought have presented different arguments on this subject matter. Ontological questions of whether the nature of property is inherently similar, whether it is conceptually or culturally construed, or whether its conceptual or cultural meaning varies in time and space are but a few of the many questions that assail the concept of property. 1 *BA (Cape Coast), Dip.
