        "abstract": "We present a simplified, task-agnostic multi-modal pre-training approach that can accept either video or text input, or both for a variety of end tasks. Existing pre-training are task-specific by adopting either a single cross-modal encoder that requires both modalities, limiting their use for retrieval-style end tasks or more complex multitask learning with two unimodal encoders, limiting early cross-modal fusion. We instead introduce new pretraining masking schemes that better mix across modalities (e.g. by forcing masks for text to predict the closest video embeddings) while also maintaining separability (e.g. unimodal predictions are sometimes required, without using all the input). Experimental results show strong performance across a wider range of tasks than any previous methods, often outperforming task-specific pre-training.

        "abstract": "Significance We have discovered that the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) catecholaminergic (CA) neurons, a group of neurons that control mouse stress response, are activated in tumor-bearing mice, and the neuronal activity promotes tumor growth in multiple syngeneic and spontaneous mouse tumor models. The tumor-promoting effect of these VLM CA neurons is mediated by cytotoxic T cells. These findings establish an interaction between a tumor and a group of neurons in the mouse brain that influences tumorigenesis and tumor growth by modulating adaptive immunity. It is known that tumor growth can be influenced by the nervous system. It is not known, however, if tumors communicate directly with the central nervous system (CNS) or if such interactions may impact tumor growth. Here, we report that ventrolateral medulla (VLM) catecholaminergic (CA) neurons in the mouse brain are activated in tumor-bearing mice and the activity of these neurons significantly alter tumor growth in multiple syngeneic and spontaneous mouse tumor models. Specific ablation of VLM CA neurons by a dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) promotor-activated apoptosis-promoting caspase-3 in Dbh-Cre mice as well as inhibition of these neurons by a chemogenetic method slowed tumor progression. Consistently, chemogenetic activation of VLM CA neurons promoted tumor growth. The tumor inhibition effect of VLM CA neuron ablation is mitigated in Dbh-Cre;Rag1−/− mice, indicating that this regulatory effect is mediated by the adaptive immune system. Specific depletion of CD8+ T cells using an anti-CD8+ antibody also mitigated the tumor suppression resulting from the VLM CA neuron ablation. Finally, we showed that the VLM CA neuronal ablation had an additive antitumor effect with paclitaxel treatment. Collectively, our study uncovered the role of VLM CA neurons in the mouse brain in controlling tumor growth in the mouse body.",

        "abstract": "Short‐term sustained Hypoxia (SH) induces a different pattern of cardiovascular and respiratory responses in rats from Wistar Ribeirão Preto (WRP), Wistar Hannover (WH) and Sprague Dawley (SD) strains. SH induces an increase in the respiratory parameters of rats from these three strains and mean arterial pressure in WRP and SD but not in WH rats. In WRP rats submitted to SH, we documented an increase in the excitability of NTS neurons sending projections to the ventral medulla (NTS‐VLM), which is part of the chemoreflex pathways. However, the role of GABAergic modulation on the neuronal excitability of NTS neurons from different strains of rats submitted to SH was not yet explored. In the present study, we evaluated the inhibitory modulation (GABAergic synaptic activity) onto NTS‐VLM neurons from WH and SD rats previously submitted to SH. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee (#136/2018). NTS‐VLM neurons were labeled with retrograde tracer (Greenbeads) previously microinjected into VLM of WH and SD rats (25‐30 days old). Ten days later, these rats were submitted to SH protocol (24hs, FiO2 0.1). Then NTS slices were obtained, and the evoked and spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs and sIPSCs, respectively) were recorded in labeled NTS‐VLM neurons using whole‐cell patch‐clamp. SH decreased the amplitude of eIPSCs in NTS‐VLM neurons from WH [‐172 ± 36 (n=7) vs ‐58.1 ± 9.3 pA (n=7), p=0.0100] and also from SD rats [‐231.8 ± 33.9 (n=9) vs ‐48.9 ± 10.5 pA (n=6), p=0.0009]. SH decreased the decay‐time in NTS‐VLM neurons from SD rats (25.4 ± 5.1 vs 9.2 ± 1.2 ms, p= 0.0247) but produced no change in the rise‐time of the events in both rat strains. SH decreased the frequency of sIPSCs in NTS‐VLM neurons from WH [1.7 ± 0.4 (n=8) vs 0.8 ± 0.2 Hz, (n=9), p=0.0290] and from SD rats [2.3 ± 0.17 (n=5) vs 0.51 ± 0.13 ms (n=6), p<0.0001]. No significant changes were observed in amplitude and half‐width of sIPSCs of NTS‐VLM neurons from both rat strains. The data show that SH decreases the evoked and spontaneous GABAergic neurotransmission on NTS‐VLM neurons from WH and SD rats, probably by affecting the presynaptic terminal. The observed change in GABAergic modulation onto the NTS neuronal excitability may explain the observed alterations in the respiratory pattern in WH and SD rats in response to SH.",

        "abstract": ": One of the latest communications technologies is wireless networking. If it uses a given frequency range for transmitting huge amounts of data, the communication system is called effective. This provides efficient data transfer and an increasing 4G to 5G communications system. The OFDM system theory notes that it is a type of multi-carrier modulation of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) that has a large demand for digital wideband communication. It encodes the data at different frequencies of the carrier. Digital audio and high definition television, broadband networks and 4G mobile communications are included in these areas of use. It is widely used for communication purposes to reduce inter-symbol interference, decreased nonlinear distortion due to its great advantages as it provides high spectral efficiency. The OFDM system suffers from the inconvenience of high PAPR, i.e. Peak to average power ratio. In this paper, clipping and filtering based new hybrid VLM pre-coded SLM technique was proposed to minimize PAPR in OFDM. And it was found that the proposed scheme achieved a significant gain in reducing PAPR without increasing the process complexity and impacting the system’s error output.",

Here, we report the use of a pedicled chimeric sensitive ALT and vastus lateralis muscle (VLM) flap in a patient with a 12 cm × 8 cm contaminated soft tissue defect of the right inguinal region with exposed femoral vessels. The flap was harvested based on two perforators, one musculocutaneous and one pure muscular, each nourished separately a sensitive fasciocutaneous component and a vastus lateralis muscle component, respectively. The muscle part was tailored to wrap around the exposed vascular structures, while the innervated skin and fascia component of the flap provided a tension‐free closure of the wound. The post‐operative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged at 1 week post‐operative. Even though it requires technical skills and experience in perforator dissection, we believe that the pedicled chimeric sensitive ALT and VLM flap may be one of the best solutions in case of exposed femoral vessels in contaminated wounds.",

A dual-bay VLM order picking (dual-bay VLM-OP) system is a particular solution where the operator works in parallel with the crane, allowing higher throughput performance. The purpose of this paper is to define models for different operating configurations able to improve the total throughput of the dual-bay VLM-OP system.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nAnalytical models are developed to estimate the throughput of a dual-bay VLM-OP. A deep evaluation has been carried out, considering different storage assignment policies and the sequencing retrieval of trays.\n\n\nFindings\nA more accurate estimation of the throughput is demonstrated, compared to the application of previous models. Some use guidelines for practitioners and academics are derived from the analysis based on real data.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nDiffering from previous contributions, these models include the acceleration/deceleration of the crane and the probability of storage and retrieve of each single tray. This permits to apply these models to different storage assignment policies and to suggest when these policies can be profitably applied. They can also model the sequencing retrieval of trays.\n",

        "abstract": "The exploration of retinal vessel structure is colossally important on account of numerous diseases including stroke, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and coronary heart diseases, which can damage the retinal vessel structure. The retinal vascular network is very hard to be extracted due to its spreading and diminishing geometry and contrast variation in an image. The proposed technique consists of unique parallel processes for denoising and extraction of blood vessels in retinal images. In the preprocessing section, an adaptive histogram equalization enhances dissimilarity between the vessels and the background and morphological top-hat filters are employed to eliminate macula and optic disc, etc. To remove local noise, the difference of images is computed from the top-hat filtered image and the high-boost filtered image. Frangi filter is applied at multi scale for the enhancement of vessels possessing diverse widths. Segmentation is performed by using improved Otsu thresholding on the high-boost filtered image and Frangi’s enhanced image, separately. In the postprocessing steps, a Vessel Location Map (VLM) is extracted by using raster to vector transformation. Postprocessing steps are employed in a novel way to reject misclassified vessel pixels. The final segmented image is obtained by using pixel-by-pixel AND operation between VLM and Frangi output image. The method has been rigorously analyzed on the STARE, DRIVE and HRF datasets.",

        "abstract": "This work presents the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based maneuver loads calculations for a flying wing configuration. Euler solutions of the DLR Tau code are compared to vortex lattice method (VLM) results for maneuver loads in the preliminary design stage. The trim parameters of the quasi-steady maneuver load case, the structural deformation and the flow solution are determined in an iterative process. The focus is on a comprehensive loads analysis including a broad selection of load cases to cover the whole flight envelope. This is necessary to ensure a thorough preliminary design. Integration of this approach in an automated, preliminary design process and application of parametric, aeroelastic modeling allows to perform structural optimization loops to evaluate the difference between VLM and CFD on the structural design in terms of structural net mass. 1 MOTIVATION AND INTRODUCTION The design process for new aircraft configurations is complex, costly, and involves various disciplines like aerodynamics, structure, loads analysis, aeroelasticity, flight mechanics, and weights. The task is to substantiate the selected design, based on physically meaningful simulations and analyses. Modifications are much more costly at a later stage of the design process. Thus, the preliminary design should be as good as possible to avoid “surprises” at a 1 Figure 1: The MULDICON structural layout and mass discretization of the basic flight design mass (BFDM).",

        "abstract": "\n <p>In this study, we focus on better constraint of the long term glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) signal at present-day, and its role as a contributor to total present-day rates of change. The main study area extends from the coastal regions of northern Europe to Scandinavia. Both Holocene relative sea level (RSL) data as well as vertical land motion (VLM) data are incorporated as constraints in a semi-empirical GIA model. Specifically, 70 geological rates of GIA-driven RSL change are inferred from Holocene data; peak RSL fall is indicated in central Scandinavia and the northern British Isles where past ice sheets were thickest, RSL rise is indicated in the southern British Isles and along the northern European coastline. Rates of vertical land motion from GPS at 108 sites provide an additional measure of regional GIA deformation. Within the study area, the geological RSL data complement the spatial gaps of the VLM data and vice versa; both datasets are inverted in a semi-empirical GIA model to yield updated estimates of regional present-day GIA deformations. A regional validation is presented for the North Sea, where the GIA signal may be complicated by lateral variations in Earth structure and existing predictions of regional and global GIA models are discrepant. The model validation in the North Sea region indicates that geological data are needed to fit independent estimates of GIA-related RSL change inferred from tide gauge rates, suggesting that the geological rates provide an important additional constraint of present-day GIA.</p>\n",

Euler solutions of the DLR Tau code are compared to vortex lattice method (VLM) results for maneuver loads in the preliminary design stage. The trim parameters of the quasi-steady maneuver load case, the structural deformation and the flow solution are determined in an iterative process. The focus is on a comprehensive loads analysis including a broad selection of load cases to cover the whole flight envelope. This is necessary to ensure a thorough preliminary design. Integration of this approach in an automated, preliminary design process and application of parametric, aeroelastic modeling allows to perform structural optimization loops to evaluate the difference between VLM and CFD on the structural design in terms of structural net mass.",

Il y a un besoin dans la communaute de developper des modeles numeriques pour toutes les disciplines qui permettent de relier les phases de design conceptuel, preliminaire et detaillee \nde facon continue, de telle sorte que les choix faits soient consistants entre eux. \nL’objectif de ce travail est de developper un modele aerodynamique adapte pour l’optimisation conceptuelle multidisciplinaire avec un faible cout de calcul et une fidelite suffisante pour explorer un vaste espace de conception dans les regimes transsoniques et basses vitesses avec systemes hypersustentateurs.

There is a need in the community to have numerical models in all disciplines that span the conceptual, preliminary and detail design \nphases in a seamless fashion so that choices made in each phase remain consistent with each other. \nThe objective of this work is to develop an aerodynamic model suitable for conceptual multidisciplinary design optimization with low computational cost and sufficient fidelity to explore a large design space in the transonic and high-lift regimes. The physics-based reduce order \nmodel is based on the inviscid Vortex Lattice Method (VLM), selected for its low computation time. Viscous effects are modeled with two-dimensional high-fidelity RANS calculations at various sections along the span and incorporated as an angle of attack correction inside \nthe VLM. The viscous sectional data are calculated with infinite swept wing conditions to allow viscous crossflow effects to be included for a more accurate maximum lift coefficient and spanload evaluations. These viscous corrections are coupled through a modified alpha coupling \nmethod for 2.5D RANS sectional data, stabilized in the post-stall region with artificial dissipation. \nThe fidelity of the method is verified against 3D RANS flow solver solutions on the Bombardier Research Wing (BRW). Clean and high-lift configurations are investigated. The overall results show impressive precision of the VLM/2.5D RANS approach compared to \n3D RANS solutions and in compute times in the order of seconds on a standard desktop computer. \nFinally, the aerodynamic solver is implemented in an optimization framework with a Covariant Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) optimizer to explore the design space of aerodynamic wing planform. Single-objective low-speed and high-speed optimizations are \nperformed along with composite-objective functions for combined low-speed and high-speed optimizations with high-lift configurations as well. Moreover, the VLM/2.5D approach is capable of capturing stall cells phenomena and this characteristic is used to define a new spanwise stall criteria to be introduced as an optimization constraint. The work concludes on the limitations of the method and possible avenues for further research.",

The experimental investigation with a VLM-1 model in 1:50 scale is carried out at the Brazilian Pilot Transonic Wind Tunnel, located in the Aerodynamics Division of the mentioned Institute, using the classical schlieren flow visualization technique. Schlieren images are obtained for nominal Mach number varying from 0.9 to 1.01. Numerical simulation using Stanford’s SU2 code is conducted together with the experimental investigation in order to improve the understanding of the complex physical phenomena associated with the experimental results of this particular regime. The combination of the 2 techniques allowed the assessment of some important aspects on the flow field around the vehicle in the conditions considered in this study, such as shock wave/boundary-layer interaction. The numerical simulation is also very important, allowing the quantification of some important parameters and confirming the shock wave formation patterns observed in the simulation when compared with the schlieren images. A good agreement regarding the position of the shock wave, when compared with the schlieren images, with a maximum error of about 6%, is observed over the VLM model.",

Also, center of pressure location was found using data from VLM and wing geometry. Comparisons between literature, finite wing theory and VLM theory were done. It was found that maximum lifting coefficient error between literature and VLM was about 4.0%. Moreover, that between finite wing theory and VLM was about 2.2%.

Formation mechanisms of very low-mass (VLM) objects are still under considerable debate and an accurate assessment of their multiplicity and orbital properties are essential for constraining current theoretical models. Taking advantage of the Virtual Observatory capabilities, we looked for comoving low and VLM binary (or multiple) systems using the Large Area Survey of the UKIDSS LAS DR10, SDSS DR9, and the 2MASS Catalogues. Other catalogues (WISE, GLIMPSE, SuperCosmos ...) were used to derive the physical parameters of the systems. We report the identification of 36 low and VLM (∼M0-L0 spectral types) candidates to binary/multiple system (separations between 200 and 92000 AU), whose physical association is confirmed through common proper motion, distance and low probability of chance alignment. This new system list notably increases the previous sampling in their mass-separation parameter space (∼100). We have also found 50 low-mass objects that we can classify as ∼L0-T2 according to their photometric information. Only one of these objects presents a common proper motion high-mass companion. Although we could not constrain the age of the majority of the candidates, probably most of them are still bound except four that may be under disruption processes. We suggest that our sample could be divided in two populations: one tightly bound wide VLM systems that are expected to last more than 10 Gyr, and other formed by weak bound wide VLM systems that will dissipate within a few Gyrs.",

        "abstract": "We propose Unicoder-VL, a universal encoder that aims to learn joint representations of vision and language in a pre-training manner. Borrow ideas from cross-lingual pre-trained models, such as XLM (Lample and Conneau 2019) and Unicoder (Huang et al. 2019), both visual and linguistic contents are fed into a multi-layer Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) for the cross-modal pre-training, where three pre-trained tasks are employed, including Masked Language Modeling(MLM), Masked Object Classification(MOC) and Visual-linguistic Matching(VLM). The first two tasks learn context-aware representations for input tokens based on linguistic and visual contents jointly. The last task tries to predict whether an image and a text describe each other. After pretraining on large-scale image-caption pairs, we transfer Unicoder-VL to caption-based image-text retrieval and visual commonsense reasoning, with just one additional output layer. We achieve state-of-the-art or comparable results on both two tasks and show the powerful ability of the cross-modal pre-training.",

        "abstract": "Most existing methods in vision language pre-training rely on object-centric features extracted through object detection and make fine-grained alignments between the extracted features and texts. It is challenging for these methods to learn relations among multiple objects. To this end, we propose a new method called X-VLM to perform `multi-grained vision language pre-training.' The key to learning multi-grained alignments is to locate visual concepts in the image given the associated texts, and in the meantime align the texts with the visual concepts, where the alignments are in multi-granularity. Experimental results show that X-VLM effectively leverages the learned multi-grained alignments to many downstream vision language tasks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

        "abstract": "We provide a new analysis of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) with the goal of assembling the model uncertainty statistics required for rigorously extracting trends in surface mass from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Such statistics are essential for deciphering sea level, ocean mass, and hydrological changes because the latter signals can be relatively small (≤2 mm/yr water height equivalent) over very large regions, such as major ocean basins and watersheds. With abundant new >7 year continuous measurements of vertical land motion (VLM) reported by Global Positioning System stations on bedrock and new relative sea level records, our new statistical evaluation of GIA uncertainties incorporates Bayesian methodologies. A unique aspect of the method is that both the ice history and 1‐D Earth structure vary through a total of 128,000 forward models. We find that best fit models poorly capture the statistical inferences needed to correctly invert for lower mantle viscosity and that GIA uncertainty exceeds the uncertainty ascribed to trends from 14 years of GRACE data in polar regions.",

        "abstract": "We estimate the rates and patterns of vertical land motion (VLM) on all locations on Earth's land surface using GPS Imaging. The solution is based on a large database of uniformly processed GPS data from solutions that are aligned to the International Terrestrial Reference Frame. We provide global maps and estimates of VLM at all tide gauges of the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level to better constrain the difference between geocentric and relative sea level rise. To enable critical assessment of the VLM estimate, the temporal and spatial contributions to rate uncertainty and variability are generated and included for every gauge. Seasonality and trends of uplift are assessed and found to be strongly correlated with observations from gravity data suggesting that loading from the terrestrial hydrosphere is a dominant driver of non‐glacial isostatic adjustment (non‐GIA) VLM. Although stations are dominantly concentrated at subsiding parts of continents, GPS Imaging geographically balances VLM signals, correcting for bias associated with network distribution. This allows us to make a global assessment of the budget of uplift and subsidence attributable to GIA and non‐GIA sources. We show that the surface motion of the continents is on average upward, implying that the unobserved areas (composed of the ocean basins and ice‐covered areas) move on average downward with respect to Earth center. However, after correcting for the GIA the reverse is true, and observed areas subside on average implying that the unobserved areas undergo net non‐GIA‐related uplift.",

        "abstract": "\n The volcanism of the Eifel volcanic field (EVF), in west-central Germany, is often considered an example of hotspot volcanism given its geochemical signature and the putative mantle plume imaged underneath. EVF's setting in a stable continental area provides a rare natural laboratory to image surface deformation and test the hypothesis of there being a thermally buoyant plume. Here we use Global Positioning System (GPS) data to robustly image vertical land motion (VLM) and horizontal strain rates over most of intraplate Europe. We find a spatially coherent positive VLM anomaly over an area much larger than the EVF and with a maximum uplift of ∼1 mm yr−1 at the EVF (when corrected for glacial isostatic adjustment). This rate is considerably higher than averaged over the Late-Quaternary. Over the same area that uplifts, we find significant horizontal extension surrounded by a radial pattern of shortening, a superposition that strongly suggests a common dynamic cause. Besides the Eifel, no other area in NW Europe shows significant positive VLM coupled with extensional strain rates, except for the much broader region of glacial isostatic adjustment. We refer to this 3-D deformation anomaly as the Eifel Anomaly. We also find an extensional strain rate anomaly near the Massif Central volcanic field surrounded by radial shortening, but we do not detect a significant positive VLM signal there. The fact that the Eifel Anomaly is located above the Eifel plume suggests that the plume causes the anomaly. Indeed, we show that buoyancy forces induced by the plume at the bottom of the lithosphere can explain this remarkable surface deformation. Plume-induced deformation can also explain the relatively high rate of regional seismicity, particularly along the Lower Rhine Embayment.",

Most common disorders, i.e., stroke, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and cardiac diseases, often change the normal structure of the retinal vascular network. A lot of research has been committed to building an automatic RVS system. But, it is still an open issue. In this article, a framework is recommended for RVS with fast execution and competing outcomes. An initial binary image is obtained by the application of the MISODATA on the preprocessed image. For vessel structure enhancement, B-COSFIRE filters are utilized along with thresholding to obtain another binary image. These two binary images are combined by logical AND-type operation. Then, it is fused with the enhanced image of B-COSFIRE filters followed by thresholding to obtain the vessel location map (VLM). The methodology is verified on four different datasets: DRIVE, STARE, HRF, and CHASE_DB1, which are publicly accessible for benchmarking and validation.

Exploiting the horizontal GNSS observations, we estimate the vertical component of the deformation to provide the VLM for the entire 15,000‐km‐long coastline. The estimated vertical rates show large variability around the country as a result of volcanic, tectonic, and anthropogenic sources.

        "abstract": "Monitoring vertical land motions (VLMs) at the level of 0.1 mm/yr remains one of the most challenging scientific applications of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). Such small rates of change can result from climatic and tectonic phenomena, and their detection is important to many solid Earth‐related studies, including the prediction of coastal sea‐level change and the understanding of intraplate deformation. Reaching a level of precision allowing to detect such small signals requires a thorough understanding of the stochastic variability in GNSS VLM time series. This paper investigates how the aperiodic part of non‐tidal atmospheric and oceanic loading (NTAOL) deformations influences the stochastic properties of VLM time series. Using the time series of over 10,000 stations, we describe the impact of correcting for NTAOL deformation on 5 complementary metrics, namely: the repeatability of position residuals, the power‐spectrum of position residuals, the estimated time‐correlation properties, the corresponding velocity uncertainties, and the spatial correlation of the residuals. We show that NTAOL deformations cause a latitude‐dependent bias in white noise plus power‐law model parameter estimates. This bias is significantly mitigated when correcting for NTAOL deformation, which reduces velocity uncertainties at high latitudes by 70%. Therefore, removing NTAOL deformation before the statistical analysis of VLM time series might help to detect subtle VLM signals in these areas. Our spatial correlation analysis also reveals a seasonality in the spatial correlation of the residuals, which is reduced after removing NTAOL deformation, confirming that NTAOL is a clear source of common‐mode errors in GNSS VLM time series.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Vertical land motion (VLM) at the coast is a substantial contributor to relative sea level change. In this work, we present a refined method for its\ndetermination, which is based on the combination of absolute satellite altimetry (SAT) sea level measurements and relative sea level changes\nrecorded by tide gauges (TGs). These measurements complement VLM estimates from the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) by increasing their spatial\ncoverage. Trend estimates from the SAT and TG combination are particularly sensitive to the quality and resolution of applied altimetry data as well as\nto the coupling procedure of altimetry and TGs. Hence, a multi-mission, dedicated coastal along-track altimetry dataset is coupled with\nhigh-frequency TG measurements at 58 stations. To improve the coupling procedure, a so-called “zone of influence” (ZOI) is defined, which confines\ncoherent zones of sea level variability on the basis of relative levels of comparability between TG and altimetry observations. Selecting 20 %\nof the most representative absolute sea level observations in a 300  km radius around the TGs results in the best VLM estimates in terms of\naccuracy and uncertainty. At this threshold, VLM SAT-TG estimates have median formal uncertainties of\n0.58  mm yr−1 . Validation against GNSS VLM estimates yields a root mean square (rms ΔVLM ) of VLM SAT-TG and\nVLM GNSS differences of 1.28  mm yr−1 , demonstrating the level of accuracy of our approach. Compared to a reference\n250  km radius selection, the 300  km zone of influence improves trend accuracies by 15 % and uncertainties by 35 %. With\nincreasing record lengths, the spatial scales of the coherency in coastal sea level trends increase. Therefore, the relevance of the ZOI for\nimproving VLM SAT-TG accuracy decreases. Further individual zone of influence adaptations offer the prospect of bringing the accuracy of\nthe estimates below 1  mm yr−1 .",

        "abstract": "We analyzed a set of geodetic data to investigate the contribution of local factors, namely the sea level natural variability (SLNV) and the vertical land motion (VLM), to the sea-level trend. The SLNV is analyzed through the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) on tidal data (>60 years of recordings) and results are used to evaluate its effects on sea levels. The VLM is measured at a set of continuous GPS (cGPS) stations (>5 years of recordings), located nearby the tide gauges. By combining VLM and SLNV with IPCC-AR5 regional projections of climatic data (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5), we provide relative sea-level rise projections by 2100. Results show that the combined effects of SLNV and VLM are not negligible, contributing between 15% and 65% to the sea-level variability. Expected sea levels for 2100 in the RCP8.5 scenario are between 475 ± 203 (Bakar) and 818 ± 250 mm (Venice). In the Venice Lagoon, the mean land subsidence at 3.3 ± 0.85 mm a−1 (locally up to 8.45 ± 1.69 mm a−1) is driving the local sea-level rise acceleration.",

        "abstract": "The descending motor nerve conduction of voluntary swallowing is mainly launched by primary motor cortex (M1). M1 can activate and regulate peripheral nerves (hypoglossal) to control the swallowing. Acupuncture at “Lianquan” acupoint (CV23) has a positive effect against poststroke dysphagia (PSD). In previous work, we have demonstrated that electroacupuncture (EA) could regulate swallowing-related motor neurons and promote swallowing activity in the essential part of central pattern generator (CPG), containing nucleus ambiguus (NA), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), and ventrolateral medulla (VLM) under the physiological condition. In the present work, we have investigated the effects of EA on the PSD mice in vivo and sought evidence for PSD improvement by electrophysiology recording and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI). Four main conclusions can be drawn from our study: (i) EA may enhance the local field potential in noninfarction area of M1, activate the swallowing-related neurons (pyramidal cells), and increase the motor conduction of noninfarction area in voluntary swallowing; (ii) EA may improve the blood flow in both M1 on the healthy side and deglutition muscles and relieve PSD symptoms; (iii) EA could increase the motor conduction velocity (MCV) in hypoglossal nerve, enhance the EMG of mylohyoid muscle, alleviate the paralysis of swallowing muscles, release the substance P, and restore the ability to drink water; and (iv) EA can boost the functional compensation of M1 in the noninfarction side, strengthen the excitatory of hypoglossal nerve, and be involved in the voluntary swallowing neural control to improve PSD. This research provides a timely and necessary experimental evidence of the motor neural regulation in dysphagia after stroke by acupuncture in clinic.",

The spread between the methods has a comparable size as the formal uncertainties of the GNSS trends. Taking the median of the surrounding GNSS trends shows the best agreement with differenced altimetry - tide gauge (ALT-TG) trends. An attempt is also made to improve VLM trends from ALT-TG time series. Only using highly correlated along-track altimetry and TG time series, reduces the standard deviation of ALT-TG time series up to 10%. As a result, there are spatially coherent changes in the trends, but the reduction in the RMS of differences between ALT-TG and GNSS trends is insigniﬁcant. However, setting correlation thresholds also acts like a ﬁlter to remove problematic TG stations. This results in sets of ALT-TG VLM trends at 344-663 TG locations, depending on the correlation threshold. Compared to other studies, we decrease the RMS of differences between GNSS and ALT-TG trends (from 1.47 to 1.22 mm/yr ), while we increase the number of locations (from 109 to 155), Depending on the weighting methods the mean of differences between ALT-TG and GNSS trends varies between 0.1-0.2 mm/yr. We reduce the mean of differences by taking into account the effect of elastic deformation due to present-day mass redistribution into account.",

        "abstract": "Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is the response of the solid Earth to past ice loading, primarily, since the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20 K yr BP. Modelling GIA is challenging because of large uncertainties in ice loading history and also the viscosity of the upper and lower mantle. GPS data contain the signature of GIA in their uplift rates but these also contain other sources of vertical land motion (VLM) such as tectonics, human and natural influences on water storage that can mask the underlying GIA signal. In this study, we use about 4000 GPS vertical velocities as observational estimates of global GIA uplift rates, after correcting for major elastic deformation effects. A novel fully automatic strategy is developed to postprocess the GPS time-series and to correct for non-GIA artefacts. Before estimating vertical velocities and uncertainties, we detect outliers and jumps and correct for atmospheric mass loading displacements. We correct the resulting velocities for the elastic response of the solid Earth to global changes in ice sheets, glaciers and ocean loading, as well as for changes in the Earth’s rotational pole relative to the 20th century average. We then apply a spatial median filter to remove sites where local effects are dominant to leave approximately 4000 GPS sites. The resulting novel global GPS data set shows a clean GIA signal at all post-processed stations and is therefore suitable to investigate the behavior of global GIA forward models. The results are transformed from a frame with its origin in the centre of mass of the total Earth’s system (CM) into a frame with its origin in the centre of mass of the solid Earth (CE) before comparison with 13 global GIA forward model solutions, with best fits with Pur-6- VM5 and ICE-6G predictions. The largest discrepancies for all models were identified for Antarctica and Greenland, which may be due to either uncertain mantle rheology, ice loading history/magnitude and/or GPS errors.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study is aimed to design a novel vocabulary learning mechanism (VLM) in the previously developed video-annotated learning and reviewing system (VALRS) that allows learners to identify unfamiliar or unknown words when listening to the video and generate personalized input enhancement from English subtitles for vocabulary learning. It is expected that the VALRS with VLM (VALRS-VLM) can help learners improve their English listening comprehension in the recognition of speech sounds of individual vocabulary words and meaning understanding of vocabulary words and oral sentences. To investigate the learning effectiveness and learners’ experiences of the newly developed VLM, this study compared the outcomes of English listening comprehension performance and technology acceptance between the experimental group using the VALRS-VLM and the control group using the VALRS without the VLM (VALRS-NVLM). Analytical results show that the learners using the VALRS-VLM achieved remarkably better in both English listening learning outcomes and learning retention for vocabulary learning and overall English listening comprehension performance than those who used the VALRS-NVLM. Besides, according to the results of the questionnaire surveyed after the experiment, both the VALRS-VLM and VALRS-NVLM groups showed good technology acceptance. This study confirms that the proposed VALRS-VLM could effectively facilitate learners’ English listening learning as well as provide them with a positive learning experience.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Observations from permanent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations are commonly used to correct tide-gauge observations for vertical land motion (VLM). We combine GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) observations and an ensemble of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) predictions to assess and evaluate the impact of solid-Earth deformation (SED) due to contemporary mass redistribution and GIA on VLM trends derived from GNSS stations. This mass redistribution causes relative sea-level (RSL) and SED patterns that not only vary in space but also exhibit large interannual variability signals. We find that for many stations, including stations in coastal locations, this deformation causes VLM trends on the order of 1  mm yr−1 or higher. In multiple regions, including the Amazon Basin and large parts of Australia, the SED trend flips sign between the first half and second half of the 15-year GRACE record. GNSS records often only span a few years, and due to these interannual variations SED causes substantial biases when the linear trends in these short records are extrapolated back in time. We propose a new method to avoid this potential bias in the VLM-corrected tide-gauge record: instead of correcting tide-gauge records for the observed VLM trend, we first remove the effects from GIA and contemporary mass redistributions from the VLM observations before computing the VLM trend. This procedure reduces the extrapolation bias induced by SED, and it also avoids the bias due to sea-floor deformation: SED includes net sea-floor deformation, which is ignored in global-mean sea-level reconstructions based on VLM-corrected tide-gauge data. We apply this method to 8166 GNSS stations. With this separation, we are able to explain a large fraction of the discrepancy between observed sea-level trends at multiple long tide-gauge records and the global-mean sea-level trend from recent reconstructions.",

        "abstract": "During the subsequent deploying process after the launch, the vehicle experiences dramatic changes in geometry as well as aerodynamics, which cannot be ignored for the flight stability of the aircraft. The investigation on the flight dynamics modeling and stability analysis during the unsteady deploying process is of great significance for the flight control system design and the launch system design. The nonlinear multibody dynamic model of the vehicle, which mainly consists of the airframe and four wings, is established through the Newton–Euler method. Meanwhile, the unsteady vortex lattice method (VLM), which is suitable for tandem wing aircraft and combined with the viscosity effect in light of the strip theory, is proposed to calculate the aerodynamic loads of the vehicle during the deploying process. A series of simulations about the motion of the vehicle after the launch are calculated to analyze the effects of various parameters, including the deploying forms, the start-up time of the power system along with the launching parameters, on the stability of the aerial vehicle in the deployment process. As results indicated, a small difference in the deploying rates of wings and larger deploying rates of wings on the same side are beneficial to the stability of the vehicle during the deploying process. Additionally, it is advantageous to the pitching stability but not the lateral stability of the vehicle when the power system is started earlier. Besides, the attitude control strategy of the vehicle can be formulated in advance by analyzing the attitude of the vehicle with different launch parameters at the launching moment.",

This current study continues the refinement and improvement in analysis techniques for sea level research beyond the Fourth US National Climate Assessment (NCA4) report by incorporating further advancements in the time series analysis of long tide gauge records integrated with an improved vertical land motion (VLM) assessment. This analysis has also been synthesised with an updated regional assessment of satellite altimetry trends in the sea margins fringing the USA. Coastal margins more vulnerable to the threats posed by rising sea levels are those in which subsidence is prevalent, higher satellite altimetry trends are evident and higher ‘geocentric’ velocities in mean sea level are being observed. The evidence from this study highlights key spatial features emerging in 2020, which highlight the northern foreshore of the Gulf Coast and along the east coast of the USA south of the Chesapeake Bay region being more exposed to the range of factors exacerbating threats from sea level rise than other coastlines at present. The findings in this study complement and extend sea level research beyond NCA4 to 2020.",

        "abstract": "Cloud data centers have become a popular infrastructure to host diversified application services for tenants. To provide agility and elasticity in resource usage for cloud services, the virtual data center (VDC) is proposed to allocate both virtual machines (VM) and network bandwidth. However, at cloud scale, hardware (e.g., link, server, and switch) failures are inevitable, which may lead to degradation in service performance. To address this challenge, we study the survivable virtual data center allocation problem (SVAP), which aims at allocating survivable virtual data center (SVDC) to each tenant to guarantee resource demands will always be satisfied even after failures. Our objective is to minimize the total bandwidth consumption in order to accommodate more SVDCs. We prove that SVAP is NP-hard and design the Collocation-Aware survivable VM placement and Link Mapping algorithm (CALM). CALM solves the problem in two stages, i.e., VM placement (VMP) and virtual link mapping (VLM). We further find that without an appropriate VMP strategy, VLM cannot lead to the minimum network resource usage. Therefore, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm called collocation-aware survivable placement (CASP) for VMP. For the VLM stage, we formulate a linear programming model to map flows onto the data center network in order to ensure survivability under switch failures. We evaluate the performance via simulations and show that CALM could save up to 42 percent network resource compared to the baseline algorithm. We further show that CALM uses only additional 13 percent network resource to guarantee survivability as compared to a typical VDC strategy.",

However, it is not known which CA neurons elicit different glucoregulatory responses or whether selective activation of CA neurons is sufficient to elicit these responses. Therefore, to selectively activate CA subpopulations, we injected male or female Th-Cre+ transgenic rats with the Cre-dependent DREADD construct, AAV2-DIO-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry, at one of four rostrocaudal levels of the VLM: rostral C1 (C1r), middle C1 (C1m), the area of A1 and C1 overlap (A1/C1), and A1. Transfection was highly selective for CA neurons at each site. Systemic injection of the Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) receptor agonist, clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), stimulated feeding in rats transfected at C1r, C1m, or A1/C1 but not A1. CNO increased corticosterone secretion in rats transfected at C1m or A1/C1 but not A1. In contrast, CNO did not increase blood glucose or induce c-Fos expression in the spinal cord or adrenal medulla after transfection of any single VLM site but required dual transfection of both C1m and C1r, possibly indicating that CA neurons mediating blood glucose responses are more sparsely distributed in C1r and C1m than those mediating feeding and corticosterone secretion. These results show that selective activation of C1 CA neurons is sufficient to increase feeding, blood glucose levels, and corticosterone secretion and suggest that each of these responses is mediated by CA neurons concentrated at different levels of the C1 cell group.",

        "abstract": "Advancements in electric propulsion and the emergence of Advanced Air Mobility are driving the evolution of new aircraft designs. Since electric propulsion enables flexibility in propeller location, there is an increasing need for reliable, quick analyses of propeller-airframe interactions during the conceptual design phase. Many existing analysis tools capable of accurately modeling propeller-airframe interactions are computationally expensive and require a high level of expertise and significant time investment for setup. VSPAERO is a NASA-developed, open source, computational analysis tool that runs a Vortex-Lattice Method (VLM) solver and is targeted at conceptual design. This paper assesses the applicability of the VSPAERO VLM in the conceptual design phase by comparing VSPAERO predictions to predictions by OVERFLOW, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes Computational Fluid Dynamics solver, and RoBIN, another VLM tool. The paper details the modeling, meshing, and analysis techniques used within VSPAERO. Analyses were performed for a wing in isolation, a propeller in isolation, and then for two propeller-blown wing configurations: one with a propeller located at the midspan and another with a propeller located at the wingtip. The propeller was modeled both as an actuator disk and as rotating blades.",

Such architecture is typical in off-road construction machinery. The paper also describes the application of the proposed control strategy referred to as variable load sensing margin (VLM) on a full-size wheel loader. The paper first presents the rationale for the proposed strategy, showing how the state-of-the art LS architecture present in commercial machines has margin for lowering the throttling losses present at the control valves. A feedforward controller, derived from an empirical study on a reference vehicle, is used to control the flow to the front-end loader functions. Test results show improvements of the hydraulic power consumption up to 45%, based on the commanded speed of each front-end loader actuator. The paper also describes a gain scheduling pressure feedback control strategy which is used to allow controlling also functions that include priority. For the case of off-road vehicles this is typically the steering function. The experimental results show how good performances with an error in controlled velocity below 5%, is achieved when the front-end loader functions are used concurrently with the steering.",

        "abstract": "To face and properly mitigate coastal changes at a local level, it is necessary to recognize and characterize the specific processes affecting a coastline. Some of these processes are local (e.g., sediment starvation), while others are regional (e.g., relative sea-level change) or global (e.g., eustatic sea-level rise). Long tide gauge records help establish sea-level trends for a region that accounts for global (eustatic, steric) and regional (isostatic) sea-level changes. Local sea-level changes are also the product of vertical land motion (VLM), varying depending on tectonic, sedimentological, and anthropogenic factors. We investigate the role of coastal land subsidence in the present-day dynamics of an abandoned delta in the Colombian Caribbean. Satellite images and synthetic aperture radar acquisitions are used to assess decadal-scale coastline changes and subsidence rates for the period 2007–2021. We found that subsidence rates are highly variable alongshore. Local subsidence rates of up to −1.0 cm/yr correspond with an area of erosion rates of up to −15 m/yr, but coastal erosion also occurs in sectors where subsidence was not detected. The results highlight that local coastline changes are influenced by multiple, interacting drivers, including sand supply, coastline orientation and engineering structures, and that subsidence alone does not explain the high rates of coastal erosion along the study area. By the end of the century, ongoing coastal erosion rates of up to −25 m/yr, annual rates of subsidence of about −1 cm/yr, and current trends of global sea-level rise are expected to increase flooding levels and jeopardize the existence of the deltaic barrier island.",

        "abstract": "We determine late Holocene (past 4 kyr) vertical land motion (VLM) rates from relative sea level observations along the coastline of western North America and compare these to contemporary (decadal‐scale) rates inferred from Global Positioning System data. The residual rates (contemporary minus late Holocene) indicate uplift at most locations, which likely reflects short‐term signals associated with the Cascadia subduction earthquake cycle and processes that were recently activated. Regarding the latter, we model and remove the signals associated with ground water extraction and twentieth‐century glacier retreat, which have a significant influence in, respectively, California and southern British Columbia. We interpret the remaining signal as being dominated by interseismic deformation associated with the locking of the Cascadia megathrust. A preliminary comparison of this signal with output from a model of interseismic deformation indicates good agreement at most locations within a range of key model parameter values. This agreement is particularly encouraging as the locking model is based on the inversion of only horizontal land motion observations. Considering the data‐model fit at all locations, preference was found for models featuring nearly full locking to a relatively shallow depth (<30 km), although the locking state preference is variable along the coast and not strong. The best fitting parameter set varies considerably from site to site, and no set of parameter values was able to capture the residual VLM rates in northwestern Vancouver Island. Our study indicates that the residual VLM data provide useful constraints for megathrust locking models of Cascadia subduction.",

        "abstract": "Vertical land motion (VLM) at the coast is a substantial contributor to relative sea level change. In this work, we present a refined method for its determination, which is based on the combination of absolute satellite altimetry (SAT) sea level measurements and relative sea level changes recorded by tide gauges (TGs). These measurements complement VLM estimates from the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) by increasing their spatial coverage. Trend estimates from the SAT and TG combination are particularly sensitive to the quality and resolution of applied altimetry data as well as to the coupling procedure of altimetry and TGs. Hence, a multi-mission, dedicated coastal along-track altimetry dataset is coupled with high-frequency TG measurements at 58 stations. To improve the coupling procedure, a so-called “zone of influence” (ZOI) is defined, which confines coherent zones of sea level variability on the basis of relative levels of comparability between TG and altimetry observations. Selecting 20 % of the most representative absolute sea level observations in a 300 km radius around the TGs results in the best VLM estimates in terms of accuracy and uncertainty. At this threshold, VLMSAT-TG estimates have median formal uncertainties of 0.58 mmyr−1. Validation against GNSS VLM estimates yields a root mean square (rms1VLM) of VLMSAT-TG and VLMGNSS differences of 1.28 mmyr−1, demonstrating the level of accuracy of our approach. Compared to a reference 250 km radius selection, the 300 km zone of influence improves trend accuracies by 15 % and uncertainties by 35 %. With increasing record lengths, the spatial scales of the coherency in coastal sea level trends increase. Therefore, the relevance of the ZOI for improving VLMSAT-TG accuracy decreases. Further individual zone of influence adaptations offer the prospect of bringing the accuracy of the estimates below 1 mmyr−1.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of network virtualization, the workloads deployed on data center are dramatically changed to support diverse service-oriented applications, which are in general characterized by the time-bounded service response that in turn puts great burden on the data-center networks. Although there have been numerous techniques proposed to optimize the virtual network allocation in data center, the research on coordinating them in a flexible and effective way to autonomically adapt to the workloads for service time reduction is few and far between. To address these issues, in this article we propose Sova, an autonomic framework that can combine the virtual dynamic SR-IOV (DSR-IOV) and the virtual machine live migration (VLM) for virtual network allocations in data centers. DSR-IOV is a SR-IOV-based virtual network allocation technology, but its operation scope is very limited to a single physical machine, which could lead to the local hotspot issue in the course of computation and communication, likely increasing the service response time. In contrast, VLM is an often-used virtualization technique to optimize global network traffic via VM migration. Sova exploits the software-defined approach to combine these two technologies with reducing the service response time as a goal. To realize the autonomic coordination, the architecture of Sova is designed based on the MAPE-K loop in autonomic computing. With this design, Sova can adaptively optimize the network allocation between different services by coordinating DSR-IOV and VLM in autonomic way, depending on the resource usages of physical servers and the network characteristics of VMs. To this end, Sova needs to monitor the network traffic as well as the workload characteristics in the cluster, whereby the network properties are derived on the fly to direct the coordination between these two technologies. Our experiments show that Sova can exploit the advantages of both techniques to match and even beat the better performance of each individual technology by adapting to the VM workload changes.",

The main study area extends from the coastal regions of northwestern Europe to northern Europe. Both Holocene relative sea level (RSL) data as well as vertical land motion (VLM) data are incorporated as constraints in a semi-empirical GIA model. 71 geological rates of GIA-driven RSL change are inferred from Holocene proxy data and 108 rates of vertical land motion from GNSS provide an additional measure of regional GIA deformation. Within the study area, the geological RSL data complement the spatial gaps of the VLM data and vice versa. Both data sets are inverted in a semi-empirical GIA model to yield updated estimates of regional present-day GIA deformations. A regional validation using tide gauges is presented for the North Sea, where the GIA signal may be complicated by lateral variations in Earth structure and existing predictions of regional and global GIA models show discrepancies. The model validation in the North Sea region suggests that geological data are needed to fit independent estimates of GIA-related RSL change inferred from tide gauge rates, indicating that geological rates from Holocene data do provide an important additional constraint for data-driven approaches to GIA estimation.",

The present study aims to evaluate the effects of the health promotion model-based visual learning module (HPM-VLM) on self-efficacy and behavioral modifications among stroke survivors. Methods This nonrandomized controlled trial was conducted on 70 stroke survivors (intervention group, n = 35, and control group, n = 35). The intervention group was subjected to two sessions of the HPM-VLM and the control group received routine instructions. Data were collected through face-to-face structured interview, and observation using a self-structured self-efficacy questionnaire and health promotion behavior questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive (frequency and percentage) and inferential (Chi-square, independent t-test, mixed model, and ANCOVA) values by IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS; version 23) software. Results Eventually, follow-up could have been completed for 66 participants (intervention group, n = 34, and control group, n = 32). HPM-VLM is found to be effective in the promotion of self-efficacy (19.2 ± 1.6 vs. 16.12 ± 2.5; p = 001) and health promotion behavior of stroke survivors in most of the domains (p < 0.01).

        "abstract": "We estimate the rate of vertical land motion (VLM) in the region around the Western Transverse Ranges (WTR), Ventura, and Big Bend of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) of southern California using data from four geodetic techniques: GPS, interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), leveling, and tide gauges. We use a new analysis technique called GPS Imaging to combine the techniques and leverage the synergy between (1) high geographic resolution of InSAR, (2) precision, stability, and geocentric reference frame of GPS, (3) decades long observation of VLM with respect to the sea surface from tide gauges, and (4) relative VLM along dense leveling lines. The uncertainty in the overall rate field is ~1 mm/yr, though some individual techniques have uncertainties as small as 0.2 mm/yr. The most rapid signals are attributable to subsidence in aquifers and groundwater changes. Uplift of the WTR is geographically continuous, adjacent to the SAF and appears related to active crustal contraction across Pacific/North America plate boundary fault system. Uplift of the WTR and San Gabriel Mountains is ~2 mm/yr and is asymmetrically focused west of the SAF, consistent with interseismic strain accumulation across thrust faults in the Ventura area and Santa Barbara channel that accommodate contraction against the near vertical SAF.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Watson, P.J., 2020. Updated mean sea-level analysis: Australia. Journal of Coastal Research, 36(5), 915–931. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. As an island nation with 60,000 km of open coastline and extensive margins of increasingly urbanised intertidal estuarine foreshores, Australia is critically exposed to the global threat posed by rising sea levels into the future. This study provides a contemporary assessment of sea-level rise around Australia to the end of 2018, based on all available tide gauge records and satellite altimetry. The study provides the first national assessment of vertical land motion (VLM) around the coast, identifying margins more prevalent to subsidence, which in turn exacerbate the localised effects of a rising global mean sea level. These areas include coastlines between Townsville and Coffs Harbour, Burnie to Port Pirie, and Fremantle to Wyndham. State-of-the-art time-series analysis techniques applied to all high-quality tide gauge records exceeding 75 years in length (four sites) enabled improved insights into the temporal resolution of current rates of rise and accelerations in mean sea level around Australia than were previously available. Averaged across these four records in 2018, approximately 40% of the “relative” velocity observed (∼2.2 ± 1.8 mm/y, 95% confidence limit [CL]) is attributable to VLM. When corrected for VLM, only the Fort Denison site exhibits “geocentric” mean sea-level velocity in 2018 exceeding 2 mm/y. The average geocentric velocity across all four sites in 2018 equates to 1.3 ± 2.0 mm/y (95% CL). Interestingly, each long record exhibits similar temporal characteristics, whereby a low point in the velocity time series occurs sometime in the period from 1970 to 1990, after which velocity increases over time to a peak occurring sometime after ca. 2010, suggesting the presence of a small acceleration (albeit not statistically different to zero at the 95% CL) in the record.",

We present a high‐resolution VLM model for the wider Arctic, that includes both present‐day ice loading (PDIL) and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). The study shows that the nonlinear elastic uplift from PDIL is significant (0.5–1 mm yr−1) in most of the wider Arctic and exceeds GIA at 15 of 54 Arctic GNSS sites, including sites in nonglaciated areas of the North Sea region and the east coast of North America. Thereby the sea level change from PDIL (1.85 mm yr−1) is significantly mitigated from VLM caused by PDIL. The combined VLM model was consistent with measured VLM at 85% of the GNSS sites ( R=0.77 ) and outperformed a GIA‐only model ( R=0.64 ). Deviations from GNSS‐measured VLM can be attributed to local circumstances causing VLM.",

        "abstract": "Large‐scale subsidence due to aquifer‐overdraft is an ongoing hazard in the San Joaquin Valley. Subsidence continues to cause damage to infrastructure and increases the risk of extensional fissures.Here, we use InSAR‐derived vertical land motion (VLM) to model the volumetric strain rate due to groundwater storage change during the 2007–2010 drought in the San Joaquin Valley, Central Valley, California. We then use this volumetric strain rate model to calculate surface tensile stress in order to predict regions that are at the highest risk for hazardous tensile surface fissures. We find a maximum volumetric strain rate of −232 microstrain/yr at a depth of 0 to 200 m in Tulare and Kings County, California. The highest risk of tensile fissure development occurs at the periphery of the largest subsiding zones, particularly in Tulare County and Merced County. Finally, we assume that subsidence is likely due to aquifer pressure change, which is calculated using groundwater level changes observed at 300 wells during this drought. We combine pressure data from selected wells with our volumetric strain maps to estimate the quasi‐static bulk modulus, K, a poroelastic parameter applicable when pressure change within the aquifer is inducing volumetric strain. This parameter is reflective of a slow deformation process and is one to two orders of magnitude lower than typical values for the bulk modulus found using seismic velocity data. The results of this study highlight the importance of large‐scale, high‐resolution VLM measurements in evaluating aquifer system dynamics, hazards associated with overdraft, and in estimating important poroelastic parameters.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Coasts in tectonically active regions face varying threat levels as land subsides or uplifts relative to rising sea levels. We review the processes influencing relative sea-level change in New Zealand, and the geological context behind ongoing land movements, focussing on major population centres. Whilst Holocene sea levels have been reconstructed using a variety of techniques, recent work uses salt-marsh microfossil assemblages to reconstruct relative sea-level changes over the past few centuries. For the twentieth century, these proxy-based studies often show enhanced rates of sea-level rise relative to tide-gauge observations. The effects of tectonic subsidence must be considered, alongside vertical and dating uncertainties in the sea-level reconstructions. Global Positioning Systems (GPS) observations for the past few decades show that vertical land movement (VLM) may be influencing rates of relative sea-level rise. However, the short period of GPS observations, during which trends and rates have varied at some localities, raises questions over the longer-term contribution of VLM to sea-level change over the past few centuries and for future projections. We argue that high-resolution palaeo-sea-level reconstructions from salt-marsh sedimentary sequences can help to answer these questions regarding the interplay between sea-level change and VLM at key locations.",

        "abstract": "Different space-borne geodetic observation methods combined with in-situ measurements enable resolving the single-point vertical land motion (VLM) and/or the VLM of an area. Continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements can solely provide very precise VLM trends at specific sites. VLM area monitoring can be performed by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology in combination with the GNSS in-situ data. In coastal zones, an effective VLM estimation at tide gauge sites can additionally be derived by comparing the relative sea-level trends computed from tide gauge measurements that are related to the land to which the tide gauges are attached, and absolute trends derived from the radar satellite altimeter data that are independent of the VLM. This study presents the conjoint analysis of VLM of the Dubrovnik area (Croatia) derived from the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-1 InSAR data available from 2014 onwards, continuous GNSS observations at Dubrovnik site obtained from 2000, and differences of the sea-level change obtained from all available satellite altimeter missions for the Dubrovnik area and tide gauge measurements in Dubrovnik from 1992 onwards. The computed VLM estimates for the overlapping period of three observation methods, i.e., from GNSS observations, sea-level differences, and Sentinel-1 InSAR data, are −1.93±0.38 mm/yr, −2.04±0.22 mm/yr, and −2.24±0.46 mm/yr, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Historically tide gauge (TG) data have been used to estimate global sea level rise. Critical to the analysis of TG records is the assumption that the TG sites are stable and not affected by vertical land motion (VLM). We analyze century‐long TG records from New Zealand that have been affected by VLM due to both major and transient earthquake events at a regional level as well as local instabilities. Using combined GPS and precise leveling, we estimate relative VLM between the GPS and TG of up to 1 mm/year. Based on 15–20 years of GPS data, the effect of seismic activity and slow slip events has uplifted sites by up to 0.8 mm/year on average in Wellington and Dunedin. Updated estimates of long‐term relative sea level (RSL) at four New Zealand TGs, as well as an estimate of RSL at a new fifth TG (New Plymouth), are determined using data through 2013—an additional 13 years compared to the previous study. The VLM corrected RSL rates gives our best estimate absolute sea level of +1.45 ± 0.28 mm/year (1891−2013). It is important that absolute sea level derived from RSL rates include realistic estimates of VLM, especially at TG sites that are close to plate boundaries, located in seismically active regions, affected by glacial isostatic adjustment, land ice loss, or gas/oil/water extraction.",

        "abstract": "The relative sea-level changes from tide gauges in the Korean peninsula provide essential information to understand the regional and global mean sea-level changes. Several corrections to raw tide gauge records are required to account for coastal vertical land motion (VLM), regional and local coastal variability. However, due to the lack of in-situ measurements such as leveling data and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), making precise assessments of VLM at the tide gauges is still challenging. This study aims to address the above limitation to assess the VLM in the Korean tide gauges using the time-series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technique. For 10 tide gauges selected in the Korean peninsula, we applied the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS)—Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) method to C-band Sentinel-1 A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired during 2014/10–2020/05, with the novel sequential interferograms pair selection approach to increase the slowly decorrelating filtered phase (SDFP) pixels density near the tide gauges. Our findings show that overall the tide gauges in the Korean peninsula are stable, besides the largest VLM observed at Pohang tide gauge station (East Sea) of about −26.02 mm/year; also, higher rates of uplift (>1 mm/year) were observed along the coast of Yellow Sea (Incheon TG and Boryeong TG) and higher rates of subsidence (<−2 mm/year) were observed at Jeju TG and Seogwipo TG. Our approach estimates the rate of VLM at selected tide gauges with an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution and is applicable when the in-situ and GNSS observations are not available.",

        "title": "Ocular Toxocariasis",
        "abstract": "Toxocariasis is a zoonotic infection of global importance. Transmission is typically fecal-oral and results from accidental exposure to food, water, or soil contaminated by either dog or, less commonly, cat roundworms – the helminths Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati, respectively. Infection is common and affects approximately 20% of the world’s population, with seroprevalence rates surpassing 80% in some tropical and subtropical regions in Africa and Asia. While many Toxocara infections are asymptomatic, moderate to severe systemic, neurologic, and/or ocular infections can occur. These are referred to respectively as visceral (VLM), neurologic (NVM), and ocular larva migrans (OLM; also known as ocular toxocariasis OT). Three classic patterns or OT have been described, including posterior granuloma – typically submacular or peripapillary and with pronounced retinal striae or folds; peripheral granuloma, often with a vitreoretinal traction band extending toward the posterior pole; and severe, unilateral intermediate or panuveitis referred to as nematode or Toxocara endophthalmitis. Atypical presentations of OT also exist. One metanalysis, three original articles, and one letter in this issue of Ocular Immunology & Inflammation (OII) address aspects of the prevalence, presentation, treatment and outcome of OT. Badri et al. performed a meta-analysis of five English language database listings (PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) from January 1966 to December 2019 to explore the prevalence of OT in six recognized World Health Organization (WHO)-epidemiological regions. A total of 101 studies with 331,602 cases from 35 countries met the inclusion criteria. Overall, studies that utilized immunologic methods, such as serology for nematodespecific antibodies, showed a higher pooled prevalence than those where the diagnosis was based on ophthalmological examination (9%, 95% CI 6–12% vs 1%, 95% CI 1–2%), male subjects were identified slightly more often than female subjects (OR 1.44, 95% CI 0.94–2.20, nominal p < .01), and the diagnosis of OT was made most often in the second decade of life (7%, 95% CI 1–18%, nominal p < .01) vs roughly half that prevalence for other age groups, and regions of lower-middle class income (6%, 95% CI 2–12%, nominal p < .01). The pooled prevalence of OT in the African WHO-epidemiological region was highest at 10% (95% CI 7–13%), followed by the European region at 8% (95% CI 4–12%), the region of the Americas at 6% (95% CI 2–10%), the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions at 3% each (95% CI 0–10% and 1–5%, respectively), and the South-East Asia Region at 1% (95% CI 0–3%). It should be noted, however, that only one study was available from Africa – specifically Sierra Leone (10%, 95% CI 7–13%). Other countries of high prevalence included Peru (39%, 95% CI0-99%) and Slovenia (39%, 95% CI17-36%). Pooled prevalences of near zero were identified in Ireland, Germany, Spain and Nepal, and slightly higher at about 1% in Turkey, Myanmar, and the Czech Republic. Identified risk factors for a higher pooled prevalence of OT included ownership of dogs or cats (18%, 95% CI 0–96%), contact with dogs (17%, 95% CI3-39%), consumption of raw or undercooked meat (12%, 95% CI 0–53%), and exposure to soil (6%, 95% CI 0–27%). The anatomic location of inflammation was described most often as intermediate (6%, 95% CI 1–15%), followed by anterior (3%, 95% CI 0–10%), posterior (2%, 95% CI 1–4%), and panuveitis (1%, 95% CI 0–1%). Granulomas, when described, were most often central (5%, 95% CI 3–7%), followed by peripheral (4%, 95% CI1-8%). The authors concluded that their findings were generally in agreement with those of global epidemiologic studies based on the analyses of anti-Toxocara seroprevalence. They also emphasized the importance of considering OT in endemic areas, and of good hygiene, limiting pet exposure to public places, such as playgrounds and parks, and of monitoring and treating dogs and cats for helminthic infections. Martinez et al retrospectively reviewed the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics, as well as treatment and outcome of 157 patients less than 13 years of age with OT seen in a tertiary referral center in Costa Rica between January 1998 and December 2018. All patients had unilateral disease, the mean age was 6.7 ± 2.8 years, 97 (61.8%) were male, 145 (92.4%) had positive serology for T. canis, and 79 (50.3%) had eosinophilia. The most common reasons for consultation included decreased vision (29.9%), strabismus (26.7%), leukocoria (19.7%) and red eye (17.8%). The vast majority of patients presented with vision between 20/200 and no light perception (NLP, 89.2%). Associated ocular complications included cataract (17.5%), posterior synechiae formation (9.7%), band keratopathy (3.9%), and hypopyon formation (1.3%). The posterior segment could not be visualized in 12.7% of affected eyes. In the remaining eyes, a peripheral granuloma was identified in 57 (54.2%), a posterior granuloma in 27 (25.8%), and no granuloma in 21 (20.0%). Eighty-eight (56.1%) had a retinal detachment (RD). Treatments were tailored to findings and included no therapy in 64 eyes (40.8%), use of prednisone in 32 eyes (20.4%), pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) alone in 23 eyes (14.6%), prednisone plus thiabendazole in 16 eyes (10.2%), cataract surgery in 9 eyes (5.7%), 5 eyes (3.2%) treated with thiabendazole alone, and 3 eyes (1.9%) treated with regional corticosteroids alone. Most eyes with RD failed to show functional improvement despite treatment. The authors concluded that OT is an important cause of moderate-to-severe vision loss in Costa Rica, and that RD, in particular, is a predictor of poor visual outcome. Wang and Tao retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics, pattern of inflammatory cytokines, ocular complications and predictors of recurrence of inflammation within 6 months of presentation and treatment in a cohort OCULAR IMMUNOLOGY AND INFLAMMATION 2021, VOL. 29, NOS. 7–8, 1243–1245 https://doi.org/10.1080/09273948.2021.2018825",

In this paper, we first propose a review of the international literature focused on MEMS VLM development, reviewing the different geometries and heating solutions proposed in the literature. Then, we focus on a critical aspect of these micro thrusters: the presence of unstable phenomena. In particular, the boiling instabilities and reverse channel flow substantially impact the MEMS VLMs’ performance and limit their applicability. Finally, we review the research focused on the passive and active control of the boiling instabilities, based on VLM geometry optimization and active heating strategies, respectively. Today, these ones represent the two principal research axes followed by the scientific community to mitigate the drawbacks linked to the use of MEMS VLMs.",

Using knowledge obtained from past probing trials or Finite Element (FE) simulations, we implemented this likelihood conditioning in an autonomous palpation control strategy. Based on a recursive Bayesian inferencing framework, this new control strategy adapts the sweeping direction and the stiffness of the probe to detect abnormal stiff inclusions in soft tissues. This original control strategy for compliant palpation probes shows a sub-millimeter accuracy for the 3D localization of the nodules in a soft tissue phantom as well as a 100% reliability detecting the existence of nodules in a soft phantom.",

        "abstract": "Morphing aircraft are the flight vehicles that can reconfigure their shape during the flight in order to achieve superior flight performance. However, this promising technology poses cross-disciplinary challenges that encourage widespread design possibilities. This research aims to investigate the flight dynamic characteristics of various morphed wing configurations that can be incorporated in small-scale UAVs. The objective of this study was to analyze the effects of in-flight wing sweep and wingspan morphing on aerodynamic and flight stability characteristics. Longitudinal, lateral, and directional characteristics were evaluated using linearized equations of motion. An open-source code based on Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) assuming quasi-steady flow was used for this purpose. Trim points were identified for a range of angles of attack in prestall regime. The aerodynamic coefficients and flight stability derivatives were compared for the aforementioned morphing schemes with a fixed-wing counterpart. The results indicated that wingspan morphing is better than wing sweep morphing to harness better aerodynamic advantages with favorable flight stability characteristics. However, extension in wingspan beyond certain limits jeopardizes the advantages. Dynamically, wingspan and sweep morphing schemes behave in an exactly opposite way for longitudinal modes, whereas lateral-directional dynamics act in the same fashion for both morphing schemes. The current study provided a baseline to explore the advanced flight dynamic aspects of employed wing morphing schemes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract: The objective of this work is to study the differences that occur in behavior and properties of the emitted electron beam from tungsten (W) tips before and after coating these tips with a thin layer of a good proven dielectric material. Core metallic tips have been prepared from a polycrystalline (99.995% purity) tungsten (W) wire. Analysis has been carried out for clean W emitters before and after coating these tips with two differences types of epoxy resins; namely: (Epoxylite 478 and UPR-4). For critical comparison and analysis, several tungsten tips with various apex- radii (very sharp) have been prepared with the use of electrochemical etching techniques. The tips have been coated by dielectric thin films of various thicknesses. Their characteristics have been recorded before and after the process of coating. These measurements have included the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics, Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) plots, visible light microscope (VLM) image and scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrographs to measure the influence of the Epoxylite resin coating’s thickness on the tips after coating. Special distributions have been recorded from the phosphorescent screen of a field electron emission microscope as well. Comparing the two sets of composite systems tested under similar conditions has provided several advantages. Recording highly interesting phenomena has produced a wide opportunity to develop a new type of emitter that includes the most beneficial features of both types.\nKeywords: Cold field emission, Epoxylite 478, Epoxylite UPR-4.",

        "abstract": "The analysis of retinal vascular is quite important because many diseases including stroke, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and coronary heart diseases can damage retinal vessel structure. In this research, a technique has been proposed using a combination of pre-processing steps, vessel enhancement techniques, segmentation and post-processing. The pre-processing section comprises of adaptive histogram equalisation for dissimilarity enhancement between vessels and background, a morphological top hat filter for macula and optic disc removal and high boost filtering, edges enhancement. Frangi filter is applied at multi-scale for enhancement of different vessel widths. Segmentation has been performed using global Otsu thresholding with some offset applied on difference image and enhanced image separately. A vessel location map (VLM) has been extracted using the post-processing steps of raster to vector transformed area and eccentricity-based threshold to eliminate the exudate/unwanted region from binarised image. Post-processing has been used in a new way to reject misclassified vessel pixels. The final segmented image has been obtained by using pixel-by-pixel AND operation between VLM and Frangi binarised image. The method has been rigorously analysed using STARE and DRIVE datasets.",

        "abstract": "Continuously operating Global Navigation Satellite Systems (cGNSS) can be used to convert relative values of vertical land motion (VLM) derived from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to absolute values in a global or regional reference frame. Artificial trihedral corner reflectors (CRs) provide high-intensity and temporally stable reflections in SAR time series imagery, more so than naturally occurring permanent scatterers. Therefore, it is logical to co-locate CRs with cGNSS as ground-based geodetic infrastructure for the integrated monitoring of VLM. We describe the practical considerations for such co-locations using four case-study examples from Perth, Australia. After basic initial considerations such as land access, sky visibility and security, temporary test deployments of co-located CRs with cGNSS should be analysed together to determine site suitability. Signal to clutter ratios from SAR imagery are used to determine potential sites for placement of the CR. A significant concern is whether the co-location of a deliberately designed reflecting object generates unwanted multipath (reflected signals) in the cGNSS data. To mitigate against this, we located CRs >30 m from the cGNSS with no inter-visibility. Daily RMS values of the zero-difference ionosphere-free carrier-phase residuals, and ellipsoidal heights from static precise point positioning GNSS processing at each co-located site were then used to ascertain that the CR did not generate unwanted cGNSS multipath. These steps form a set of recommendations for the installation of such geodetic ground-infrastructure, which may be of use to others wishing to establish integrated InSAR-cGNSS monitoring of VLM elsewhere.",

This prompts us to examine the full sample of seven short (t E < 7 days) planetary events with good q measurements. We find that six have clustered Einstein radii θ E = 115 ± 20 μas and lens–source relative proper motions μ rel ≃ 9.5 ± 2.5 mas yr−1. For the seventh, these two quantities could not be measured. These distributions are consistent with a Galactic bulge population of very low mass (VLM) hosts near the hydrogen-burning limit. This conjecture could be verified by imaging at first adaptive optics light on next-generation (30 m) telescopes. Based on a preliminary assessment of the sample, “planetary” companions (i.e., below the deuterium-burning limit) are divided into “genuine planets,” formed in their disks by core accretion, and VLM brown dwarfs, which form like stars. We discuss techniques for expanding the sample, which include taking account of the peculiar “anomaly-dominated” morphology of the KMT-2016-BLG-2605 light curve.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: Treatment for orbital venolymphatic malformations (VLMs) commonly includes 3 major options: sclerotherapy, surgery, and embolization followed by surgical excision. Each has certain advantages, although it is not clear whether all are effective. The authors characterize the clinical course for a series of patients with distensible orbital venous-dominant VLM treated with sclerotherapy and/or embolization with excision. Methods: In this cross-sectional cohort study, patients affected by distensible orbital venous-dominant VLM presenting to the orbital and ophthalmic plastic surgery service from 2014 to 2020 were identified. Patients were included if they presented with a moderate-flow, distensible venous-dominant malformation associated with Valsalva-related symptoms (e.g., pain, proptosis, and diplopia). Results: Six cases were treated with sclerotherapy. Four underwent multiple treatments, with a mean ± SD of 3.5 ± 2.3 (range 1–7). All patients in this group failed to improve or experienced recurrence of symptoms after sclerotherapy. Twelve cases were treated with embolization and excision.

        "abstract": "A comprehensive method which determines the most efficient propeller blade shapes for a given axisymmetric hull to travel at a desired speed, is presented. A nonlinear optimization method is used to design the blade, the shape of which is defined by a 3-D B-spline polygon, with the coordinates of the B-spline control points being the parameters to be optimized for maximum propeller efficiency, for given effective wake and propeller thrust. The performance of the propeller within the optimization scheme is assessed by a vortex-lattice method (VLM). To account fully for the hull/propeller interaction, the effective wake to the propeller and the hull resistance are determined by analyzing the designed propeller geometry by the VLM, coupled with a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver. The optimization method re-designs the optimum blade with the updated effective wake and propeller thrust (taken to be equal to the updated hull resistance), and the procedure continues until convergence of the propeller performance. The current approach does not require knowledge of the wake fraction or the thrust deduction factor, both of which must be estimated a priori in traditional propeller design. The method is applied for a given hull to travel at a desired speed, and the optimum blades are designed for various combinations of propeller diameter and RPM, in the case of open and ducted propellers with provided duct shapes. The effects of the propeller diameter and RPM on the designed propeller thrust, torque, propeller efficiency, and required power are presented and compared with each other in the case of open and ducted propellers. The present approach is shown to provide guidance on the design of propulsors for underwater vehicles, and is applicable to the design of propulsors for surface ships.",

Treatment with minocycline, a microglial inhibitor, attenuated the increase in AP in response to SH. The increase in the amplitude of glutamatergic postsynaptic currents in the NTS‐VLM neurons, induced by postsynaptic mechanisms, was blunted by minocycline treatment. The number of microglial cells was increased in the NTS of vehicle‐treated SH rats but not in the NTS of minocycline‐treated rats.

It is thus of importance to study solid-phase forms of VLM in order to be able to ensure its polymorphic purity in drug formulations. The previously available solid-state NMR (SSNMR) data are combined with the plane-wave DFT computations in the NMR crystallography framework. Structural/spectroscopical predictions (the PBE functional/GIPAW method) are obtained to characterize four polymorphs of VLM. Interactions which confer a conformational stability to VLM molecules in these crystalline forms are described in detail. The way how various structural factors affect the values of SSNMR parameters is thoroughly analyzed, and several SSNMR markers of the respective VLM polymorphs are identified. The markers are connected to hydrogen bonding effects upon the corresponding (13C/15N/1H) isotropic chemical shifts of (CO, Namid, Hamid, Hα) VLM backbone nuclei. These results are expected to be crucial for polymorph control of VLM and in probing its interactions in dosage forms.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Background High rates of physical and mental health comorbidities are associated with functional impairment among persons who are homeless. Cognitive dysfunction is common, but how it contributes to various functional outcomes in this population has not been well investigated. This study examines how cognition covaries with community functioning and subjective quality of life over a 6-year period while accounting for the effects of risk and protective factors. Methods Participants were 349 homeless adults (mean age = 39.8) recruited from the Toronto site of the At Home/Chez Soi study, a large Canadian randomized control trial of Housing First. Participants completed up to four clinical evaluations over 6 years. Factor scores were created to index verbal learning and memory (vLM) and processing speed-cognitive flexibility (PSCF). The primary outcomes were community functioning and subjective quality of life. Risk factors included lifetime homelessness, mental health diagnoses, medical comorbidity, and childhood adversity. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted to examine cognition-functional outcome associations over time, with resilience as a moderator. Results Better vLM (b = 0.787, p = 0.010) and PSCF (b = 1.66, p < 0.001) were associated with better community functioning, but not with quality of life. Resilience conferred a protective effect on subjective quality of life (b = 1.45, p = 0.011) but did not moderate outcomes. Conclusions Our findings suggest a need to consider the unique determinants of community functioning and quality of life among homeless adults. Cognition should be prioritized as a key intervention target within existing service delivery models to optimize long-term functional outcomes.",

The lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) contains GABAergic neurons that participate in control of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and cardiovagal responses. We sought to determine whether there was loss of putative GABAergic neurons in the LPGi and adjacent regions in MSA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSections of the medulla were processed for GAD65/67 immunoreactivity in eight subjects with clinical and neuropathological diagnosis of MSA and in six control subjects.

Then a 40-kg DEP Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) demonstrator is designed and developed by using the developed initial sizing method and the aerodynamic analyses method of Vortex Lattice Method (VLM). The aerodynamic characteristics of the demonstrator are investigated and analysed in detail by using the ground mobile testing and numerical calculation methods. Finally, the DEP demonstrator is used for flight testing, and the sizing method and performance of the demonstrator are preliminarily verified. The results showed that due to the influence of the DEP system, the lift coefficient of the wing segment is increased by around 0.2 in the linear phase, and the drag coefficient is also increased due to the propulsors’ incidence angle induced airflow separation.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper presents a new simplified numerical approach (SNA) for predicting hydrodynamic data of underwater wings (UWs). Instead of full three-dimensional (3D) flow field analyses, SNA combines Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and several two-dimensional Reynolds-Average Navier-Stokes (2D RANS) simulations of wing sections to gain results. Hence, SNA shows a remarkably lower computational cost than higher-fidelity methods such as 3D RANS. Moreover, SNA shows good agreements with 3D RANS and experimental data. Thereafter, SNA is applied to shape optimizations of UWs for efficiency and accuracy. Two kinds of optimisation algorithms that include local and global finders are adopted in the optimiser. Searching behaviours of the two algorithms indicate that the problem is not proper to be solved by the local optimiser for its multimodality, while the global optimiser is more efficient. Furthermore, the final optimised wing has few wing-tip vortices and a smooth pressure distribution.",

        "abstract": "The West Qinling orogen has played an important role in accommodating the deformation in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau induced by the India-Eurasia convergence. Here we construct a vertical land motion (VLM) model based on the latest leveling observations adjacent to the West Qinling orogen. Combined with the horizontal deformation field, the crustal deformation pattern in this area is investigated. Additionally, slip rate and coupling coefficients of the West Qinling fault, the longest fault separating the West Qinling orogen from the Lanzhou (Longxi) block, are inverted and constrained with GPS and VLM observations. Results show that the West Qinling fault slips slowly at a rate of 1–2 mm/yr and is strongly coupled with a moment magnitude deficit of Mw7.4. The crustal uplift rates adjacent to the West Qinling orogen are 0–3 mm/yr; which combined with 0–12.5 × 10−9/yr contraction rates, suggests that strain transformation plays a key role in controlling the tectonic uplift in the West Qinling orogen, and furthers our understanding of the contemporary geomorphic and topographic features. We identify a significant deformation transition belt at longitudes of 105°–106°E, which indicates that crustal deformation, induced from the northeastern expansion of the Tibetan Plateau, is mainly constrained to the plateau, rather than accommodated by crustal materials escaping eastward along the Qinling Mountains.",

        "abstract": "The stall behavior of an empennage is a crucial and conditioning factor for its design. Thus, the preliminary design of empennages requires a fast low-order method which reliably computes the stall behavior and which must be sensitive to the design parameters (taper, sweep, dihedral, airfoil, etc.). Handbook or semi-empirical methods typically have a narrow scope and low fidelity, so a more general and unbiased method is desired. This paper presents a nonlinear vortex lattice method (VLM) for the stall prediction of generic fuselage-empennage configurations which is able to compute complete aerodynamic polars up to and beyond stall. The method is a generalized form of the van Dam algorithm, which couples the potential VLM solution with 2.5D viscous data. A novel method for computing 2.5D polars from 2D polars is presented, which extends the traditional infinite swept wing theory to finite wings, relying minimally on empirical data. The method has been compared to CFD and WTT results, showing a satisfactory degree of accuracy for the preliminary design of empennages.",

        "abstract": "Today, more and more studies are devoted to activation of primary components of building materials. This paper is concerned with the viability of activating mineral bonding materials, Portland cement in particular, in the Vortex Layer Machine (VLM) with a purpose of physical modification. By applying modern methods for studying the specific surface, pH change, X‐ray phase and differential‐thermal analysis, and IR spectroscopy, it was found that activation of Portland cement in the VLM constitutes an efficient method for enhancing physical and chemical activity. It was also found that, depending on the content of mineral additives in the VLM, activation of Portland cement leads to significant extension of its specific surface, decrease of particle size, and also to prevalence of processes related to activation of an agent in the surface layer. During activating Portland cement, mineral crystal structure is being destructed, with the most significant changes observed for C3S. Besides, processing Portland cement in the VLM results in polycondensation of SiO4‐tetrahedral units, which reduces the basicity of hydrated calcium silicates during hydration; in the cement stone, ettringite content increases, and so does content of low‐basic hydrated calcium silicates and aluminates, which reinforces strength and chemical resistance of concrete. The acquired results speak for benefits of activating mineral bonding materials in the VLM with the purpose of enhancing physical‐mechanical properties of building materials.",

The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitude about SDM and preference of CycleBeads over CycleBead mobile application amongst accredited social health activist (ASHA) as a public health worker. A mixed-method study was conducted on 140 ASHA workers, allocated into two groups of 70 members each in experimental and control group. A simple random sampling technique was used for quantitative strand and purposive sampling for qualitative strand. A self-structured knowledge questionnaire, attitude scale and focus group discussion were used for data collection. Self-developed virtual learning module (VLM) on SDM with CycleBeads was used as an intervention. In the experimental group, there was a significant difference between pre-existing (5.74 ± 2.05) and post-test (14.64 ± 2.25) knowledge score, whereas the difference between the mean of pre-test (4.32 ± 0.67) and post-test (4.68 ± 0.46) attitude scores was not significant. There was no statistically significant difference in the knowledge and attitude scores in the control group. In the qualitative interview, participants expressed their preference for CycleBeads over CycleBead mobile application to teach women about SDM. VLM is useful in improving the knowledge regarding SDM of ASHAs as a public health worker. Public health workers (ASHA) preferred teaching SDM with CycleBeads in person instead of a mobile application for educating the beneficiaries.",

We identified isolates of Rothia nasisuis in the upper respiratory tract of weaned healthy piglets that produce valinomycin in vitro and in vivo via its vlm-encoded non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) enzyme complex. Valinomycin is an antiviral and antibiotic ionophore that shuttles potassium ions across membranes and is capable of inflammasome activation and apoptosis in LPS-primed macrophages at concentrations of 1 uM. Polarized monolayers of epithelial cells were much less sensitive to valinomycin but concentrations ≥ 10 µM decreased trans-epithelial resistance. R. nasisuis inhibited growth of closely related species of Rothia. Deliberate inoculation of valinomycin-producing R. nasisuis into newborn piglets suggested this species can shape the microbiota post weaning. Our findings support the idea that valinomycin is a competitive niche factor potentially also compromising epithelial integrity to gain access to (micro)nutrients.",

Follower forces effect and geometric nonlinearity are considered to calculate the deformation of the wing by finite element method (FEM). In the wind tunnel tests, the divergence dynamic pressure is predicted by the Southwell method, and the static aeroelastic displacement is measured by a photogrammetric method. The results obtained by the medium fidelity model calculations show reasonable agreement with wind tunnel test results.

So to show the ability of T. cati to produce such migration in the rats as experimental model and detection through histopathological observations to detect larval migratory patterns. Adult females T. cati were collected from naturally infected feral cats. Eight rats, Rattus norvegicus had acted as a model for experimental infection, each receiving an infectious dose of about 1000 infective T. cati eggs, while 2 rats served as non-infected control group. Two infected rats were sacrificed and examined at 7, 14, 21, and 28 day post infection (dpi) and tissue samples were taken for digestioning order to recover migrated larvae and for histopathological examination. In vitro embryonation of T. cati eggs was successfully carried out, although the percentage of embryonation was 10%, prepared inoculums were also infective to rats. Larvae recovered from the lungs at 7 and 14 dpi and were also present at 21, and 28 dpi. The larvae of T. cati were present in the intestines at 14, and 21 dpi. There were no larvae or less than one larva per gram found in other studied tissues. Histopathological changes in different organs were observed. Generally speaking, a multi-tissue response can be defined as the histopathological response of T. cati larval migration. The migratory larvae of T. cati can cause severe histopathological alterations in various tissues and organs of infected animals, within the current study shows that the lungs are a favorable site of migration for these larvae. T. cati is a zoonotic parasite that is underestimated.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Journalists work in a creative profession and often become emotionally attached to “their” medium. Emotions toward their work are an integral part of journalists’ career histories. At the same time, working conditions within contemporary journalism are in a state of constant change that could lead to job precariousness and general insecurity. Emotions are also understood to be part of the journalists’ engagement with the local media environment: though local newsrooms are experiencing similar changes, peripheral newsrooms have different opportunities to respond. The aim of this article is to investigate local journalists’ emotions toward their work during times of change. Drawing on a longitudinal qualitative case study based on interviews, this article focuses on how journalists manage their emotions throughout their career histories in the local media environment. The study focuses on local journalists in the VLM group, the dominant local press owner in the Czech Republic, which has experienced permanent losses and staff layoffs over the past few years. The interviewed journalists manifest deepening contradictions in their feelings towards work, the media organisation which employs them and the local community. The increasing volatility of their emotional responses has led to a general dissatisfaction and the growing importance of emotional management.",

The clinical characteristics of pulmonary VLM caused by A. suum, however, are unclear. We assessed the clinico-radiologic features of this disease. Methods Medical records, including the results of chest radiography and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), were retrospectively reviewed from January 2000 through June 2019, at the University of Miyazaki Hospital and Kyoritsuiin Hospital in Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. Results Seven patients with VLM caused by A. suum were identified. All seven patients had a unique habit of consuming raw foods, such as organic vegetables, chicken, turkey, wild boar, and venison. All but one patient, who had eosinophilic pneumonia with a fever and severe fatigue, had only mild or no respiratory symptoms. All 7 patients had remarkable eosinophilia (median, 1,960 /μL) and high serum IgE levels (median, 1,346 IU/mL). Chest HRCT revealed multiple nodules and multiple nodular ground-glass opacities in 57% and 29% of the patients, respectively. The pulmonary lesions were located predominantly in subpleural areas. All seven patients were treated with albendazole, which led to improvement within two to three months. Neither eggs nor parasites were detected in the feces or sputum of any patient. Conclusion Consumption of raw organic vegetables or raw meat is a possible route of A. suum infection. Infected patients exhibit mild respiratory symptoms, and multiple nodules with a halo in the subpleural area are a common finding on chest HRCT. Treatment with albendazole was effective in these cases.",

        "abstract": "Sometimes a pavement deflects only because of seasonal volume change of expansive soils in the pavement subgrade. Engineering practitioners expect an implementable and straightforward analysis method for a geosynthetic-reinforced pavement subjected to the swelling/shrinkage issue of expansive clayey subgrade, in an effort to find the bending moment, shear force and tension force distributions through the reinforced pavement, which are induced from the volumetric changes of subgrade soils. The virtual load method (VLM) was proposed in the past following the Timoshenko beam theory to analyze geosynthetic-reinforced pavement on expansive soils. In the VLM, the unknown virtual distributed load was obtained in the way by applying the inverse theory for the identification of material parameters of the pavementfoundation system. It was seen that the selection of the number of material parameters to obtain virtual load significantly affects the accuracy of the structural properties of the pavement and tensile properties of the geosynthetics if the linear least square method is used. In this paper, a unique numerical scheme was proposed in the hopes of solving the issue. After a forward problem was solved numerically, the Timoshenko beam deflection was taken as a start-up for the inverse problem to back analyze the load applied to the pavement. Solutions from forward/backward examples have explicitly shown the accuracy achieved related to the bending moment in the pavement and tension in the geosynthetic reinforcements. The proposed methodology can be applied for an in-depth understanding of the geosynthetic function for the mitigation of longitudinal cracks on pavements caused by heave/shrinkage of expansive soils.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Human toxocariasis is caused by several species of the nematode Toxocara. Two common clinical syndromes are ocular and visceral larva migrans. Objectives To determine the Toxocara antibody positivity in clinically suspected VLM patients and to describe demographic factors and clinical manifestations of seropositive patients. Methods 522 clinically suspected patients were studied between 1993 and 2014. Relevant data was gathered from referral letters. Serum samples were subjected to Toxocara antigen ELISA. Results Overall, seropositivity was 50.2% (262), of which 109 (40.8%) were positive at high level of Toxocara antibody carriage and 153 (58.4%) were positive at low levels. The seropositives ranged from 3 months to 70 years (mean = 7.8). Younger age group had higher levels of seropositivity and it was statistically significant. Majority of children under 5 years were seropositive (47.7%, n = 125). Seropositivity was common in males (55.3%, n = 145). Clinical manifestations of seropositives include lymphadenopathy (24.1%) skin rash (22.5%), dyspnoea (21.7%), fever (21%), hepatosplenomegaly (9.2%), and abdominal pain (3.8%). 197 (75.2%) seropositive cases had eosinophilia. These symptoms were not statistically significant. Conclusions This study confirms toxocariasis as an important cause of childhood ill health identifying common clinical symptoms recommending preventive measures to limit transmission.",

        "abstract": "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is mechanistically complex and one probable cause is seizure‐related respiratory dysfunction. Medullary respiratory regulatory nuclei include the pre‐Bötzinger complex (pre‐BötC) in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM), the medullary raphé nuclei (MR) and nucleus of solitary tract in the dorsomedial medulla (DMM). The region of the VLM also contains intermingled tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) catecholaminergic neurones which directly project to the pre‐BötC and regulate breathing under hypoxic conditions and our aim was to evaluate these neurones in SUDEP cases. In post‐mortem cases from three groups [SUDEP (18), epilepsy controls (8) and non‐epilepsy controls (16)] serial sections of medulla (obex + 2 to + 13 mm) were immunolabeled for TH. Three regions of interest (ROI) were outlined (VLM, DMM and MR) and TH‐immunoreactive (TH‐IR) neurones were evaluated using automated detection for overall labeling index (neurones and processes) and neuronal densities and compared between groups and relative to obex level. C‐fos immunoreactivity was also semi‐quantitatively evaluated in these regions. We found no significant difference in the density of TH‐IR neurones or labeling index between the groups in all regions. Significantly more TH‐IR neurones were present in the DMM region than VLM in non‐epilepsy cases only (P < 0.01). Regional variations in TH‐IR neurones with obex level were seen in all groups except SUDEP. We also identified occasional TH neurones in the MR region in all groups. There was significantly less c‐fos labeling in the VLM and MR in SUDEP than non‐epilepsy controls but no difference with epilepsy controls. In conclusion, in this series we found no evidence for alteration of total medullary TH‐IR neuronal numbers in SUDEP but noted some differences in their relative distribution in the medulla and c‐fos neurones compared to control groups which may be relevant to the mechanism of death.",

        "abstract": "Due to the lack of a physical line of defense, intrusion detection becomes one of the key issues in applications of underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), especially when the confidentiality has prime importance. However, the resource-constrained property of UWSNs such as sparse deployment and energy constraint makes intrusion detection a challenging issue. This paper considers a virtual-lattice-based approach to the intrusion detection problem in UWSNs. Different from most existing works, the UWSNs consist of two kinds of nodes, i.e., sensor nodes (SNs), which cannot move autonomously, and actuator nodes (ANs), which can move autonomously according to the performance requirement. With the cooperation of SNs and ANs, the intruder detection probability is defined. Then, a virtual lattice-based monitor (VLM) algorithm is proposed to detect the intruder. In order to reduce the redundancy of communication links and improve detection probability, an optimal and coordinative lattice-based monitor patrolling (OCLMP) algorithm is further provided for UWSNs, wherein an equal price search strategy is given for ANs to find the shortest patrolling path. Under VLM and OCLMP algorithms, the detection probabilities are calculated, while the topology connectivity can be guaranteed. Finally, simulation results are presented to show that the proposed method in this paper can improve the detection accuracy and save the energy consumption compared with the conventional methods.",

Intralesional bleomycin is now commonly being used to treat such malformations. Objective The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize evidence on the safety and efficacy of bleomycin/pingyangmycin sclerotherapy for the treatment of orbital and peri-orbital VLM. Methods We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus and Cochrane database for studies reporting outcomes of bleomycin/pingyangmycin sclerotherapy for orbital and peri-orbital VLM between 1974 to April 5th, 2019. Nine retrospective cohort studies enrolling 132 patients were included. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Predefined outcome measures were subjective and objective reduction of the lesion and associated complications. Results Subjective reduction of the lesions was seen in 96.2% of the studies. Objective reduction of the lesion and symptomatic improvement were reported in 91.6 and 95% of the studies respectively. Non responders were 9.0%. Minor adverse events were reported in 18.1% of the studies. Major complications like pulmonary toxicity or pulmonary fibrosis was not encountered in any of the included studies. Quality of evidence was generally low. Conclusion Bleomycin/pingyangmycin sclerotherapy is very effective and relatively safe for the treatment of orbital and periorbital VLM and is not associated with any major side effects including pulmonary fibrosis. Limitations: The systematic review is limited mainly due to low quality of the included studies with retrospective design.",

        "abstract": "Lineage reprogramming has become a prominent focus in research since it was demonstrated that lineage restricted transcription factors can be used in vitro for direct reprogramming [1]. Recently, we reported that the ventral longitudinal musculature (VLM) of the adult Drosophila heart arises in vivo by direct lineage reprogramming from alary muscles (AM), a process which starts with dedifferentiation and fragmentation of syncytial alary muscles into mononucleate myoblasts. Central upstream activators of the genetic program regulating the development of VLMs from alary muscles are the T-box factor Org-1 (Drosophila Tbx1) and the LIM homeodomain factor Tup (Drosophila Islet1) [2]. However, the events downstream of Org-1 and Tup that exert dedifferentiation and fragmentation of alary muscles have been unknown. In the present report, we shed light on the initiation of this first step of transdifferentiation and show that AM lineage specific activation of Yorkie (Yki), the transcriptional co-activator of the transcription factor Scalloped (Sd), has a key role in initiating AM lineage reprogramming. An additional necessary input comes from active dJNK signaling, which contributes to the inactivation of the Hippo kinase cascade upstream of Yki and furthermore activates dJun. The synergistic activities of the Yki/Sd and dJun/dFos (AP-1) transcriptional activator complexes in the absence of Hippo activity initiate AM dedifferentiation and lead to the expression of Myc and piwi, which are crucial for different aspects of AM transdifferentiation. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms that mediate muscle lineage plasticity during a cellular reprogramming process occurring in vivo. Highlights Direct lineage reprogramming of alary muscles depends on Yorkie and JNK Yorkie and JNK mediate reversal of syncytial muscle cell fate Yki/Sd and AP-1 induce alary muscle dedifferentiation synergistically Yki dependent Myc induces and Piwi mediates reprogramming of alary muscles",

        "abstract": "Leveling remains the most precise technique for measuring changes in heights. However, for the purposes of determining vertical land motion (VLM), a time series of repeat leveling measurements is susceptible to artifacts and aliasing that may arise due to systematic errors, seasonal surface fluctuations, motions occurring during a survey, and any inconsistencies in the observation conditions among epochs. Using measurements from 10 repeat leveling surveys conducted twice yearly along a profile spanning ~40 km across the Perth Basin, Western Australia, we describe the observation, processing, and analysis methods required to mitigate these potential error sources. We also demonstrate how these issues may lead to misinterpretation of the VLM derived from repeat leveling and may contribute to discrepancies between geologically inferred rates of ground motion or those derived from other geodetic measurement techniques. Finally, we employ historical (~40‐year‐old) leveling data in order to highlight the errors that can arise when attempting to extrapolate VLM derived from a geodetic time series, particularly in cases where the long‐term motion may be nonlinear.",

        "abstract": "Live migration of virtual network functions (VNF) is a powerful technique with benefits of server maintenance, resource management and dynamic workload re-balance, among others. Downtime and total migration time are mainly two vital indicators to describe the performance of the VNF live migration (VLM). Modern research has effectively reduced the downtime to zero for some specific VNFs (eg. virtual router). However, for general VNFs predominantly leveraging pre-copy approach, such as firewalls, network address translators (NAT), load balancers, etc., there still remain some intractable problems: inevitable service downtime and long migration time on account of large amount of data transferred during migration, both of which result in a severe performance degradation of VNF services. To resolve these issues, we present a solution called PV-QAT to accelerate the migration process for these general VNFs. The PV-QAT creatively exploits the Para-Virtualization (PV) driver to filter out the useless memory pages in the process of migration, and unprecedentedly applies QuickAssist Technology (QAT) to provide fast compression of memory pages with low overhead, The experimental results show that PV-QAT can significantly reduce 77.5% of downtime and 80.5% of total migration time on average when compared with original pre-copy migration of KVM.",

The study area extends from the coastal regions of northern Europe to Scandinavia. Both Holocene relative sea level (RSL) data as well as vertical land motion (VLM) data are incorporated as constraints in a semi-empirical GIA model. Specifically, 71 geological rates of GIA-driven RSL change are inferred from Holocene proxy data. Rates of vertical land motion from GNSS at 108 sites provide an additional measure of regional GIA deformation; within the study area, the geological RSL data complement the spatial gaps of the VLM data and vice versa. Both datasets are inverted in a semi-empirical GIA model to yield updated estimates of regional present-day GIA deformations. A regional validation is presented for the North Sea, where the GIA signal may be complicated by lateral variations in Earth structure and existing predictions of regional and global GIA models show discrepancies. The model validation in the North Sea region suggests that geological data are needed to fit independent estimates of GIA-related RSL change inferred from tide gauge rates, indicating that geological rates from Holocene data can provide an important additional constraint for data-driven approaches to GIA estimation. The geological proxy rates therefore provide a unique dataset with which to complement or validate existing data-driven approaches that use satellite era rates of change.</p>",

        "abstract": "We propose a vertical linear motor (VLM) for semiconductor manufacturing equipment that compensates for the weight of the moving part by using the balance of magnetic and elastic forces. The developed VLM achieves zero stiffness with a constant upward force over a working range. The magnetic circuit of the VLM is designed to provide a linear negative stiffness over a ±2 mm stroke, with an upward force of 14 N at a 0 mm stroke. The negative stiffness is compensated for by the positive stiffness of elastic component-like springs. The upward force is then constant over the working range and corresponds to the weight of the moving part. The proposed VLM is designed to minimize the coupling effects of stiffness and gravity compensation forces by using magnetic flux saturation and magnetic flux path design. We investigate the effects of each design parameter on VLM operation through finite element analysis. Finally, the simulated forces in the proposed VLM are experimentally verified, indicating a linear negative stiffness of approximately −13.5 N/mm and a gravity compensation force of 14.9 N.",

        "abstract": "\n Purpose The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the vastus medialis oblique (VMO) compensates in patella dislocation patients with the increase of femoral anteversion angle (FAA).Methods From January 2016 to January 2021, a total of 30 knees of 27 patients with recurrent patellar dislocation (RPD Group) were reviewed for this study. Among these patients, 13 patients with patellar dislocation and excessive FAA, >30° were assigned to A Group, and 17 patients with the patellar dislocation without excessive FAA,≤30 were assigned to B Group. And 27 age and sex matched knees without patellofemoral disorders were enrolled as control (C Group). The area of the VMO and vastus lateralis muscle (VLM) was measured 20 mm above the upper edge of the patella, and the ratio of the VMO and VLM area was calculated. The correlation relationship of FAA and VMO, VLM was analyzed.Results Comparing with the C Group, the RPD Group had a significantly larger FAA (30.10± 9.61°vs 15.00± 1.85°, P< 0.05), and smaller VMO/VLM ratio (3.49±1.00/4.18±1.51, P< 0.05), and the VMO/VLM ratio was significantly greater in A Group than the B Group (3.97±1.11 vs3.12±0.70, P< 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in VMO/VLM ratio among A Group and C Group (3.12±0.70/3.97±1.11, P> 0.05). And the VMO/VLM ratio was decreased in the B Group compared with the C Group (3.12±0.70/4.18±1.51, P< 0.05). The VMO/VLM ratio was positively correlated with the FAA(r=0.42) in the RPD Group.Conclusion Compared with the C Group, the patients with recurrent patellar dislocation had a smaller VMO/VLM ratio. Moreover, the FAA was positively correlated with the VMO/VLM in patients with patella dislocation. This finding explained the compensatory thickening of the VMO in response to excessive FAA in patients with patella dislocation.",

        "abstract": "Background: Physical training of lower leg skeletal muscle has been shown to increase exercise tolerance in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients. The objective of this study was to measure the effect of concurrent aerobic-resistance interval exercise on lower leg muscle function and local muscle tissue oxygenation in the vastus lateralis muscle (VLM) of COPD patients. Methods: Peripheral muscle oxygenation in the VLM was measured using Near Infrared Spectrometry (NIRS) during the sixminute walk test (6MWT) in 15 COPD patients: Experimental (EXP., n = 9) and control (CTL., n = 6). Both groups trained for 3 weeks (1 hour/day and 5 days/ week). Training sessions consisted of upper body strength exercises for 20 minutes. Next, the CTL. Group performed 30 minutes of aerobic exercise (motorized treadmill or stationary bike), while the EXP. group completed 30 minutes of aerobic-resistance (concurrent training) interval exercise (non-motorized treadmill). Pre and post-intervention NIRS measurements included oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), hemoglobin difference (HbDif), total hemoglobin (tHb), and tissue saturation index (TSI). Systemic arterial oxygen saturation (SPO2), heart rate and the rating of perceived exertion with the modified Borg scale were also measured pre and post-intervention during the 6MWT. Results: All patients were able to complete three weeks of training. A significant increase in the 6MWT (51.4%, p < 0.05) distance was noted in the EXP. group and in the VLM HbDiff (69%, p < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the other muscle oxygenation variables. Conclusion: Concurrent aerobic-resistance interval exercise increases the total distance covered at the 6MWT (increased functional capacity) and muscle oxygen extraction.",

        "abstract": "<p>Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) and the hydrological cycle are both associated with mass changes, which are observed by GRACE, and vertical land motion (VLM), which is observed by GPS. Hydrology-related VLM results from the instantaneous response of the elastic solid Earth to surface loading by freshwater, whereas GIA-related VLM reveals the long-term response of the visco-elastic Earth mantle to past glacial cycles. Thus, observations of mass changes and VLM are interrelated and GIA and hydrology are difficult to investigate independently. Taking advantage of the differences in the spatio-temporal characteristics of the GIA and hydrology fields, we can separate the respective contributions of each process. In this work, we use a Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling (BHM) approach to provide a new data-driven estimate of GIA and time-evolving hydrology-related VLM for North America. We detail our processing strategy to prepare the input data for the BHM while preserving the content of the original observations. We discuss the separation of GIA and hydrology processes from a statistical and geophysical point of view. Finally, we assess the reliability of our estimates and compare our results to the latest GIA and hydrological models. Specifically, we compare our GIA solution to a forward-model global field, ICE-6G, and a recent GIA estimate developed for North America (Simon et al. 2017). Our time-evolving hydrology field is compared with WaterGAP, a global water balance model. Overall, for both GIA and hydrology, there is a good agreement between our results and the forward models, but we also find differences which possibly highlight deficiencies in these models.</p>",

        "abstract": "The work presented in this paper describes the modelling of a low-order aeroelastic solver, built with the aim of analysing the dynamics of very flexible wing aircraft, with a focus on the coupling between the flight dynamics and the structural dynamics. The model implements a geometrically exact, low-order nonlinear beam solver based on beam shape functions coupled with Vortex Lattice Method (VLM), specifically adapted to account for large deformations. The static solution calculated by implementing the VLM was compared with the one calculated using strip theory as aerodynamic solver, showing good agreement in magnitude, but different load distribution. The aeroelastic solver was then used to analyse the dynamics of a flexible aircraft constrained to a circular trajectory with free pitch (resembling the motion on a Pendulum Rig) and on a spherical motion with free pitch and yaw (resembling the motion on the University of Bristol 5-DOF Manoeuvre Rig), for two different values of pitch stiffness and three different flexible wings (5% deflection, 10% deflection and 15% deflection with respect to the wing semispan). The results show that when the stiffness is high, it suppresses any interaction between the flight dynamics and the structural dynamics. Therefore there is no impact of the wing flexibility on the aircraft motion. On the other hand, when lowering the value of the pitch stiffness, the interaction between the wing dynamics and the pitch dynamics become evident. However, the impact of the wing flexibility was found to be always negligible on the yaw dynamics.",

This is true for all the inversion approaches that estimate GIA signal from contemporary datasets such as GNSS vertical land motion (VLM) time-series and GRACE geopotential time-series. One of the assumptions in these GIA inversions is that the change in VLM due to GIA can be written in terms of surface mass change and average mantle density. Furthermore, the surface density change is obtained from GRACE data using the relations derived in Wahr et al., 1998, which actually is only applicable for surface processes (such as hydrology) and not for sub-surface processes such as GIA. This leaves us with a tricky signal-separation problem. Although many studies try to overcome this by constraining the inversion with the help of constrains from a priori GIA models, the output is not free from influence of GIA models that are known to have huge uncertainties. In this presentation, we discuss this problem in detail, then provide a novel mathematical framework that solves for GIA without any a priori GIA model. We validate our method in a synthetic environment first and then estimate a completely data-driven GIA field from contemporary Earth-observation data.</p>",

The methods are evaluated regarding their ability to predict the performance of a configuration consisting of four rigid wing sails of an approximate height of 80 m and average chord length of 23 m. The distance between the wing sails, from trailing to leading edge, is about one chord length. For a limited number of test cases, it is evaluated how well the methods balance computational cost and accuracy and their potential to predict the performance of multiple rigid wing configurations. Two different types of aerodynamic methods are compared; one method under development based on potential flow/lifting line theory in combination with pre-calculated 2D CFD RANS data (CORR-SILL), and a vortex lattice method (VLM). The results from the two different methods are compared with 3D CFD RANS simulations. The parameters compared are the induced velocities around the sails, system forces and longitudinal center of effort.

        "abstract": "Abstract Laboratory transmission soft X-ray microscopy (L-TXM) has emerged as a complementary tool to synchrotron-based TXM and high-resolution biomedical 3D imaging in general in recent years. However, two major operational challenges in L-TXM still need to be addressed: a small field of view and a potentially misaligned rotation stage. As it is not possible to alter the magnification during operation, the field of view in L-TXM is usually limited to a few tens of micrometers. This complicates locating areas and objects of interest in the sample. Additionally, if the rotation axis of the sample stage cannot be adjusted prior to the experiments, an efficient workflow for tomographic imaging cannot be established, as refocusing and sample repositioning will become necessary after each recorded projection. Both these limitations have been overcome with the integration of a visible-light microscope (VLM) into the L-TXM system. Here, we describe the calibration procedure of the goniometer sample stage and the integrated VLM and present the resulting 3D imaging of a test sample. In addition, utilizing this newly integrated VLM, the extracellular matrix of cryofixed THP-1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cells) was visualized by L-TXM for the first time in the context of an ongoing biomedical research project.",

        "abstract": "Many real-world problems require modeling and forecasting of time series, such as weather temperature, electricity demand, stock prices and foreign exchange (FX) rates. Often, the tasks involve predicting over a long-term period, e.g. several weeks or months. Most existing time series models are inheritably for one-step prediction, that is, predicting one time point ahead. Multi-step or long-term prediction is difficult and challenging due to the lack of information and uncertainty or error accumulation. The main existing approaches, iterative and independent, either use one-step model recursively or treat the multi-step task as an independent model. They generally perform poorly in practical applications. In this paper, as an extension of the self-organizing mixture autoregressive (AR) model, the varied length mixture (VLM) models are proposed to model and forecast time series over multi-steps. The key idea is to preserve the dependencies between the time points within the prediction horizon. Training data are segmented to various lengths corresponding to various forecasting horizons, and the VLM models are trained in a self-organizing fashion on these segments to capture these dependencies in its component AR models of various predicting horizons. The VLM models form a probabilistic mixture of these varied length models. A combination of short and long VLM models and an ensemble of them are proposed to further enhance the prediction performance. The effectiveness of the proposed methods and their marked improvements over the existing methods are demonstrated through a number of experiments on synthetic data, real-world FX rates and weather temperatures.",

        "abstract": "In this work we explore the initial design space for composite kites, focusing on the configuration of the bridle line system and its effect on the aeroelastic behaviour of the wing. The computational model utilises a 2D cross sectional model in conjunction with a 1D beam model (2+1D structural model) that captures the complex composite coupling effects exhibited by slender, multi-layered composite structures, while still being computationally efficient for the use at the initial iterative design stage. This structural model is coupled with a non-linear vortex lattice method (VLM) to determine the aerodynamic loading on the wing. In conjunction with the aerodynamic model, a bridle model is utilised to determine the force transfer path between the wing and the bridles connected with the tethers leading to the ground station. The structural model is coupled to the aerodynamic and bridle models in order to obtain the equilibrium aero-structural-bridle state of the kite. This computational model is utilised to perform a design space exploration to assess the effects of varied load introduction to the structure and resulting effects on the kite.",

        "abstract": "Many companies selling products through e-commerce are on the rise. Their products must be stored, picked and send. Most of them do not need huge storage space and consider using a limited number of Vertical Lift Modules (VLM). These companies experience though that the throughput of a standalone VLM is sometimes too low for efficient picking. This paper presents throughput models for both (i) Existing and (ii) New concepts for standalone VLMs, in order for these companies to project future VLM performance. The models are built starting from already existing throughput models for single bay VLMs and dual bay VLMs. They are extended with new available configurations including multiple lifts in a single lift shaft and buffer systems under the picking bay. The models are parametrized so that the influence of VLM height, vertical transport speed and acceleration of trays, transfer time of trays between lift shaft and storage area can be properly assessed. The paper introduces also a novel VLM configuration based on a combination of existing VLMs which proves to have a considerably higher picking capacity. The models show that mainly the effective availability of trays for picking is increased.",

        "abstract": "Two induced drag analysis techniques, Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and panel method are renowned for inviscid aerodynamic computations and are widely used in the aerospace industry and academia. To demonstrate the applicability of potential flow theory and to establish an extensive correlation of linearized, attached potential flow-solver codes for estimating lift and induced drag, a generic rectangular wing planform is analyzed. Due to a wide range of applicability in conceptual design, the two solvers are compared for accuracy, computational time and input controllability to find an optimum solver that can predict inviscid aerodynamics accurately and efficiently but with the least amount of time. VLM-based code is founded upon the Laplace equation. It approximates a three-dimensional wing into a two-dimensional planform, making it apposite for moderate aspect ratio and thin-airfoil aircraft. A modified VLM is used that takes a suction parameter, calculated analytically, as an input to capture three-dimensional leading-edge thrust and vortex lift effects. On the contrary, the higher-order panel method takes the complete wing surface and changes the wake orientation to model modified flow to better predict the effects of downwash. These codes, allow computation in both subsonic and supersonic regimes, as they include Prandtl-Glauert compressibility correction. The rectangular wing is generated with an identical number of panels and networks for coherent comparison. Distinguishable pre-processing techniques are utilized and similar boundary conditions and flow conditions are maintained over the surfaces that are then given to solvers. The induced drag polar is plotted and compared with wind tunnel and analytical data.",

        "abstract": "Introduction Data on the comparative effectiveness of Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPPs) in the workplace are limited. Methods Between September 2015 and July 2016, employees of the City and County of San Francisco who were at risk for type 2 diabetes (N = 158) were randomly assigned to one of 2 DPP-derived programs recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: an in-person YMCA-DPP (n = 78) or an online virtual lifestyle management DPP (VLM-DPP) offered through Canary Health (n = 80). The primary outcome was change in body weight assessed at 6 and 12 months. Follow-up ended in August 2017. Results Both the YMCA-DPP and VLM-DPP yielded a significant reduction in percentage body weight at 6 months. For the YMCA-DPP, mean percentage change at 6 months was −2.70% (95% confidence interval [CI], −3.91% to −1.48%) and at 12 months was −2.46% (95% CI, −4.24% to −0.68%). For the VLM-DPP, mean percentage change at 6 months was −2.41% (95% CI, −4.07% to −0.77%) and at 12 months was −1.59% (95% CI, −3.51% to 0.33%). The mean between-condition difference at 6 months was −0.25% (95% CI, −2.04% to 1.55%) and at 12 months was −0.84% (95% CI, −3.03% to 1.34%). No significant differences were observed between conditions. The YMCA-DPP had a slightly higher reduction in waist circumference than VLM-DDP at 6 months (mean between-condition difference −2.00 cm [95% CI, −4.24 to 0.25 cm]). Participant engagement, expressed as mean number of completed core program sessions, was significantly higher for the YMCA-DPP than the VLM-DPP. Participants of the YMCA-DPP completed an average of 10.2 sessions (95% CI, 9.0 to 11.4), and participants of the VLM-DPP completed an average of 5.9 sessions (95% CI, 4.7 to 7.1). The adjusted mean between-condition difference was 4.2 sessions (95% CI, 2.54 to 5.99). Conclusion Both the YMCA-DPP and VLM-DPP yielded weight loss at 6 months, which was maintained at 12 months in the YMCA-DPP. The workplace may be an effective setting to offer DPPs.",

        "abstract": "Polymers are often added with water as a viscosifier to improve oil recovery from hydrocarbon reservoirs. Polymer might be lost wholly or partially from the injected polymer solution by adsorption on the grain surfaces, mechanical entrapment in pores, and hydrodynamic retention in stagnant zones. Therefore, having a clear picture of polymer losses (and retention) is very important for designing a technically and economically successful polymer flood project. The polymer adsorption and mechanical entrapment are discussed more in depth in the literature, though the effect of hydrodynamic retention can be just as significant. This research investigates the effect of the hydrodynamic retention for low and high molecular weight (AN 113 VLM and AN 113 VHM) sulfonated polyacrylamide polymer. Two high permeability Bentheimer core plugs from outcrops were used to perform polymer corefloods. Polymer retention was first determined by injecting 1 cm3/min, followed by polymer core floods at 3, 5, and 8 cm3/min to determine the hydrodynamic retention (incremental retention). A higher molecular weight polymer (AN 113 VHM) showed higher polymer retention. In contrast, hydrodynamic retention for lower molecular weight (AN 113 VLM) was significantly higher than that of the higher molecular weight polymer. Other important observations were the reversibility of the hydrodynamic retention, no permanent permeability reduction, the shear thinning behavior in a rheometer, and shear thickening behavior in core floods.",

        "abstract": "Optimisation is aimed at enhancing aircraft design by identifying the most promising wing planforms at the early stage while discarding the least performing ones. Multiple disciplines must be taken into account when assessing new wing planforms, and a model-based framework is proposed as a way to include mass estimation and longitudinal stability alongside aerodynamics. Optimisation is performed with a particle swarm optimiser, statistical methods are exploited for mass estimation, and the vortex lattice method (VLM) with empirical corrections for transonic flow provides aerodynamic performance. Three surrogates of the aerodynamic model are investigated. The first one is based on radial basis function (RBF) interpolation, and it relies on a precomputed database to evaluate the performance of new wing planforms. The second one is based on an artificial neural network, and it needs precomputed data for a training step. The third one is a hybrid model which switches automatically between VLM and RBF, and it does not need any precomputation. Its switching criterion is defined in an objective way to avoid any arbitrariness. The investigation is reported for a test case based on the common research model (CRM). Reference results are produced with the aerodynamic model based on VLM for two- and three-objective optimisations. Results from all surrogate models for the same benchmark optimisation are compared so that their benefits and limitations are both highlighted. A discussion on specific parameters, such as number of samples for example, is given for each surrogate. Overall, a model-based implementation with a hybrid model is proposed as a compromise between versatility and an arbitrary level of accuracy for wing early-stage design.",

        "abstract": "Present-day climate-change-related ice-melting induces elastic glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) effects, while paleo-GIA effects describe the ongoing viscous response to the melting of late-Pleistocene ice sheets. The unloading initiated an uplift of the crust close to the centers of former ice sheets. Today, vertical land motion (VLM) rates in Fennoscandia reach values up to around 10 mm/year and are dominated by GIA. Uplift signals from GIA can be computed by solving the sea-level equation (SLE), \n \n \n \n S \n ˙ \n \n \n \n = \n \n \n \n N \n ˙ \n \n \n \n − \n \n \n \n U \n ˙ \n \n \n \n . All three quantities can also be determined from geodetic observations: relative sea-level variations ( \n \n \n \n S \n ˙ \n \n \n \n ) are observed by means of tide gauges, while rates of absolute sea-level change ( \n \n \n \n N \n ˙ \n \n \n \n ) can be observed by satellite altimetry; rates of VLM ( \n \n \n \n U \n ˙ \n \n \n \n ) can be determined by GPS (Global Positioning System). Based on the SLE, \n \n \n \n U \n ˙ \n \n \n \n can be derived by combining sea-surface measurements from satellite altimetry and relative sea-level records from tide gauges. In the present study, we have combined 7.5 years of CryoSat-2 satellite altimetry and tide-gauge data to estimate linear VLM rates at 20 tide gauges along the Norwegian coast. Thereby, we made use of monthly averaged tide-gauge data from PSMSL (Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level) and a high-frequency tide-gauge data set with 10-min sampling rate from NMA (Norwegian Mapping Authority). To validate our VLM estimates, we have compared them with the independent semi-empirical land-uplift model NKG2016LU_abs for the Nordic-Baltic region, which is based on GPS, levelling, and geodynamical modeling. Estimated VLM rates from 1 Hz CryoSat-2 and high-frequency tide-gauge data reflect well the amplitude of coastal VLM as provided by NKG2016LU_abs. We find a coastal average of 2.4 mm/year (average over all tide gauges), while NKG2016LU_abs suggests 2.8 mm/year; the spatial correlation is 0.58.",

        "abstract": "A morphing trailing-edge (TE) wing is an important morphing mode in aircraft design. In order to explore the static aeroelastic characteristics of a morphing TE wing, an efficient and feasible method for static aeroelastic analysis has been developed in this paper. A geometrically exact vortex lattice method (VLM) is applied to calculate the aerodynamic forces. Firstly, a typical model of a morphing TE wing is chosen and built which has an active morphing trailing edge driven by a piezoelectric patch. Then, the paper carries out the static aeroelastic analysis of the morphing TE wing and corresponding simulations were carried out. Finally, the analysis results are compared with those of a traditional wing with a rigid trailing edge using the traditional linearized VLM. The results indicate that the geometrically exact VLM can better describe the aerodynamic nonlinearity of a morphing TE wing in consideration of geometrical deformation in aeroelastic analysis. Moreover, out of consideration of the angle of attack, the deflection angle of the trailing edge, among others, the wing system does not show divergence but bifurcation. Consequently, the aeroelastic analysis method proposed in this paper is more applicable to the analysis and design of a morphing TE wing.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Watson, P.J., 2019. An assessment of the utility of satellite altimetry and tide gauge data (ALT-TG) as a proxy for estimating vertical land motion. Journal of Coastal Research, 35(6), 1131–1144. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Policy, planning, and adaptation responses to sea-level rise are being developed at increasingly localised scales, placing greater emphasis on sea-level studies to more accurately account for all vertical land motions (VLM) at tide gauge sites using technologies such as global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs). Although the spatial coverage and length of GNSS data records continues to increase in proximity to tide gauges, large tracts of the world's coastlines contain limited or no GNSS data. Various studies have investigated proxy methods of estimating VLM by trends from differenced altimetry–tide gauge techniques (ALT-TG). This study has concentrated on investigating the utility of ALT-TG techniques using so-called ‘off the shelf’ gridded satellite altimetry products (U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration Jet Propulsion Laboratory [NASA JPL] and Copernicus Climate Change Service [C3S]) for use in regional and local scale sea-level studies to estimate VLM. Twenty locations across the globe were analysed; these locations met specific data constraints designed to ensure the longest overlapping coverage of GNSS, altimetry, and tide gauge data, with the proximity of the GNSS record limited to within 1 km of the tide gauge. The utility of ALT-TG estimates was significantly improved by using gridded altimetry products no closer than 30 km from the open coast. When compared directly with measured GNSS solutions from NASA JPL, Systeme d'Observation du Niveau des Eaux Littorales (SONEL), and Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (NGL), both ALT-TG VLM estimates agree with the NGL GNSS solution for 19 of the 20 locations (95% confidence interval). This is significant given that the NGL estimates are derived over the longest timeframe available from all three key GNSS data repositories considered. If one considers the limitations of altimetry sea surface height measurements in the coastal zone, the results using gridded sea surface height anomaly products for ALT-TG derived estimates of VLM are extremely encouraging for sea-level research.",

        "abstract": "Toxocara canis is an important zoonotic roundworm distributed worldwide. The infective larvae of T. canis are one of the causes of visceral larva migrans (VLM), a clinical syndrome in humans. Diagnosing VLM is difficult, and the differential diagnosis of the larval development stage is limited. Therefore, this experimental research aimed to diagnose T. canis larvae using a molecular method, not only in liver tissue, which is the most commonly affected tissue, but also in the limb muscles, lungs and brain tissues. For this purpose, 24 BALB/c mice were infected with 1000 embryonated T. canis eggs. Necropsies were performed on the second, fourth, seventh and 14th days post-infection. While a part of the samples were digested with pepsin-HCl, the molecular method was used for the remainder of the samples to replicate the mitochondrial DNA adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase subunit-6 gene region of T. canis. BbsI, a restriction endonuclease, was used to determine the specificity of the amplicons obtained from Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The detection limit for embryonated eggs was recorded. The PCR results showed that the sensitivity of the PCR analysis was 83.3% in the liver (with 88.8% accuracy), 87.5% in the lungs (with 91.6% accuracy) and 75.0% in the brain, forelimb and hindlimb muscles (with 83.3% accuracy). In all tissues, the test specificity was determined to be 100%. In this study, the molecular method was applied to only experimentally infected BALB/c mice tissues; thus, it is suggested that it can be also employed in different paratenic hosts and materials possibly infected with T. canis.",

Design: Children with CIs were compared to NH peers using the California Verbal Learning Test for Children (CVLT-C). Study sample: Participants were 21 deaf (before age 6 months) children (6–16 years old) implanted prior to age 3 years, and 21 age-IQ matched NH peers. Results: Results revealed no differences between groups in number of words recalled. However, CI users showed a pattern of increasing use of serial clustering strategies across learning trials, whereas NH peers decreased their use of serial clustering strategies. In the CI sample (but not in the NH sample), verbal working memory test scores were related to resistance to the build-up of proactive interference, and sentence recognition was associated with performance on the first exposure to the word list and to the use of recency recall strategies. Conclusions: Children with CIs showed robust evidence of VLM comparable to NH peers. However, their VLM processing (especially recency and proactive interference) was related to speech perception outcomes and verbal WM in different ways from NH peers.",

        "abstract": "The ventrolateral medulla (VLM), including the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) and rostral VLM (RVLM), is commonly considered to be a chemosensitive region. However, the specific mechanism of chemoreception in the VLM remains elusive. Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), a family of voltage-independent proton-gated cation channels, can be activated by an external pH decrease to cause Na+ entry and induce neuronal excitability. TWIK-related acid-sensitive potassium channels (TASKs) are members of another group of pH-sensitive channels; in contrast to AISICs, they can be stimulated by pH increases and are inhibited by pH decreases in the physiological range. Our previous study demonstrated that ASICs take part in chemoreception. The aims of this study are to explore whether TASKs participate in the acid sensitivity of neurons in the VLM, thereby cooperating with ASICs. Our research demonstrated that TASKs, including TASK1 and TASK3, are colocalized with ASIC1 in VLM neurons. Blocking TASKs by microinjection of the non-selective TASK antagonist bupivacaine (BUP), specific TASK1 antagonist anandamide (AEA) or specific TASK3 antagonist ruthenium red (RR) into the VLM increased the integrated phrenic nerve discharge (iPND), shortened the inspiratory time (Ti) and enhanced the respiratory drive (iPND/Ti). In addition, microinjection of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at a pH of 7.0 or 6.5 prolonged Ti, increased iPND and enhanced respiratory drive, which were inhibited by the ASIC antagonist amiloride (AMI). By contrast, microinjection of alkaline ACSF decreased iPND and respiratory drive, which were inhibited by AEA. Taken together, our data suggest that TASK1 and TASK3 are coexpressed with ASIC1 in the VLM. Moreover, TASK1 and TASK3 contribute to the central regulation of breathing by coordinating with each other to perceive local pH changes; these results indicate a novel chemosensitive mechanism of the VLM.",

We evaluate MPSPNet on two standard object segmentation datasets (NYUDv2, PASCAL VOC) and two recently published and challenging datasets focusing on scenarios in which the hands overlap the face, VLM-HandOverFace and HOF. Additionally, we compare our method against several state-of-the-art hand segmentation methods such as RefineNet and PSPNet.

        "abstract": "This research focuses on calculating the force distribution on the wings of the LSU 05-NG aircraft by several numerical methods. Analysis of the force distribution on the wing is important because the wing has a very important role in producing sufficient lift for the aircraft. The numerical methods used to calculate the lift force distribution on the wings are Computational Flow Dynamics (CFD), Lifting Line Theory, Vortex Lattice Method and 3D Panel Method. The numerical methods used will be compared with each other to determine the accuracy and time required to calculate wing lift distribution. Because CFDs produce more accurate estimates, CFD is used as the main comparison for the other three numerical methods. Based on calculations performed, 3D Panel Method has an accuracy that is close to CFD with a shorter time. 3D Panel Method requires 400 while CFD 1210 seconds with results that are not much different. While LLT and VLM have poor accuracy, however, shorter time is needed. Therefore to analyze the distribution of lift force on the wing it is enough to use the 3D Panel Method due to accurate results and shorter computing time.",

        "title": "Wing Optimisation for Tractor Propeller Configurations: Validation and Application of Low-Order Numerical Models Adapted to Include Propeller-Induced Velocities",
        "abstract": "Even though propellers are the oldest form of propulsion, they are still a popular choice for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and passenger aircraft in certain market segments. If the propellers are mounted on the wing, strong propeller-wing interactions alter the aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft. Using low-order numerical models, it is shown in literature that the wing chord and twist distribution can be changed to maximise this efficiency. These results are only theoretical. This thesis, therefore, aims to validate and apply a numerical model for optimisation of the wing design taking propeller-wing interactions into account. A vortex lattice method (VLM) was adapted to include the effects of propeller-induced velocities. Comparing the results of the adapted VLM with existing experimental data already validates the numerical model for predicting the lift distribution. To validate it for changes in lift distribution due to wing design changes, a wind-tunnel experiment is set up. Two wings are tested in a tractor propeller configuration. The only difference between the wings is in the twist distribution. To find the lift distribution, the circulation is evaluated in the flow around a wing at several stations along the wingspan. Particle-image velocimetry was used to obtain this flow field. Indeed, the lift distributions measured on both wings are matched by predictions from the adapted VLM, which proofs the numerical model is suitable for qualitative optimisation studies. For the wing and operating conditions used for the wind-tunnel experiment, an optimisation study is performed using the adapted VLM. It shows the drag can be reduced with 34% by adopting the optimal chord and twist distribution. Even though the operating conditions are not representative for full-scale aircraft or UAVs, it does show there is a great potential for taking propeller-wing interactions into account for the design of the wing.",

Human infections can lead to syndromes called visceral larva migrans (VLM), ocular larva migrans, neurotoxocariasis, and covert toxocariasis. VLM is most commonly diagnosed in children younger than 8 years of age, but adult cases are relatively frequent among those infected by ingesting the raw tissue of paratenic hosts in East Asia. This research reports the case of a 59-year-old man with sigmoid colon cancer, who visited our institution for surgery. An intraperitoneal mass was found on preoperative computed tomography, and it was thought to be a metastatic mass from sigmoid colon cancer. A postoperative histologic examination and serum test showed eosinophilic granuloma due to toxocariasis. Diagnosis of VLM is often difficult and highly suspicious in adults. Researchers suggest, although rarely, that VLM be included in the differential diagnosis as a cause of intraperitoneal tumors.",

We report a case of hepatic VLM presenting preprandial malaise and epigastric discomfort in a 58-year-old woman drinking raw roe deer blood. The imaging studies of the abdomen showed a 74-mm hepatic mass featuring hepatic VLM. Anti-Toxocara canis immunoglobulin G (IgG) was observed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot. Despite anthelmintic treatment, the patient complained of newly developed cough and skin rash with severe eosinophilia. Hepatic lesion increased in size. The patient underwent an open left lobectomy of the liver. After the surgery, the patient was free of symptoms such as preprandial malaise, epigastric discomfort, cough, and skin rash. Laboratory test showed a normal eosinophilic count at postoperative 1 month, 6 months, 1 year, and 4 years. The initial optical density value of 2.55 of anti-T. canis IgG in ELISA was found to be negative (0.684) at postoperative 21 months. Our case report highlights that a high degree of clinical suspicion for hepatic VLM should be considered in a patient with a history of ingestion of raw food in the past, presenting severe eosinophilia and a variety of symptoms which reflect high worm burdens. Symptom remission, eosinophilia remission, and complete radiological resolution of lesions can be complete with surgery.",

        "abstract": "Eine Moglichkeit den Treibstoffverbrauch zu senken besteht darin, das Aufwindfeld von Wirbelschleppen vorausfliegender Flugzeuge auszunutzen. Dieses Prinzip machen sich Zugvogel im Formationsflug zunutze. Fur Piloten ist der manuelle Formationsflug im treibstoffsparenden Optimalpunkt zu arbeitintensiv. Diese Aufgabe muss ein Flugregler ubernehmen. Die Auslegung eines solchen Formationsflugreglers erfordert ein Wirbelschleppensimulationsmodell, welches die von der Wirbelschleppe induzierten Windfelder berechnet. In diesem Beitrag werden zwei verschiedene Wirbelschleppensimulationsmodelle fur das Szenario eines stationaren Horizontalflugs verglichen und anhand des Ergebnisses des etablierten Stangenwirbelmodells beurteilt. Die zu vergleichenden Simulationsmodelle nutzen einerseits die Prandtlsche Traglinientheorie (engl.: Lifting Line Method, LLM) und andererseits eine instationare Wirbelgittermethode (engl.: Vortex Lattice Method, VLM). Beide Methoden basieren auf der Lagrangeschen Betrachtungsweise der Bewegung von Fluidteilchen, bei der einzelne Fluidteilchen an vordefinierten Tragflachenpositionen in die Nachlaufstromung ubergeben werden und sich dort frei bewegen konnen. Die Bewegung der Fluidteilchen im Nachlauf fuhrt zur Bildung von Streichlinien. Die Streichlinien werden durch abschnittsweise gerade Wirbelfilamente approximiert. Die Wirbelstarke der Wirbelschleppe wird durch Zirkulationswerte der Wirbelfilamente diskretisiert. Aus den Lage der Wirbelfilamente und ihrer Zirkulation kann das Windfeld der Wirbelschleppe berechnet werden. Die LLM-Simulation basiert auf starker vereinfachten Annahmen als die VLM. Die Gegenuberstellung beider Modelle leistet einen Beitrag, Modellierungsfehler zu untersuchen, welche durch diese Vereinfachungen entstehen konnen. Der Vergleich zeigt auch, dass die Ergebnisse beider Berechnungsmethoden in Bezug auf die Wirbelfilamentpositionen und Windfelder bei identischen Parametern ahnlich sind. Die in der LLM umgesetzten Vereinfachungen fuhren zu einer mit der VLM vergleichbaren Wirbelschleppenberechnung im Falle eines stationaren Horizontalfluges. Die Abhangigkeit der Verfahren von ihren Parametern und die Konvergenz hin zu feineren Parametern wird untersucht. Daraus werden Empfehlungen fur Parameterwerte abgeleitet.",

This study proposes a novel video- annotated learning and review system with vocabulary learning mechanism (VALRS-VLM), which can assist learners to manually mark any video section that they cannot fully understand, and then clarify the pronunciation and usage of the unfamiliar vocabulary words appearing in the video section through an online dictionary, so as to enhance learners’ English listening performance and perception. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed VALRS-VLM, this study examines the effects of the learners in the experimental group using the VALRS-VLM with those in the control group using the video-annotated learning and review system without vocabulary learning mechanism (VALRS-NVLM) on English listening comprehension performance, learning satisfaction, technology acceptance, cognitive load, and learning retention. Analytical results show that the learners in the experimental group achieved remarkably better-listening comprehension performance and learning retention than those in the control group. Besides, both groups of the learners showed good learning satisfaction and technology acceptance, and low cognitive load. This study confirms that the proposed VALRS-VLM could effectively assist learners in facilitating English listening comprehension performance as well as achieve good learner perceived usefulness and easy of use.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the significance of the influence of VLM and SLR on inundation. We address this issue for Semarang, Central Java, by estimating VLM using the small baseline subset time series interferometry SAR method for 24 Sentinel-1 satellite data for the period March 2017 to May 2019. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) method was used to reveal the phase difference between two SAR images with two repetitions of satellite track at different times. The results of this study indicate that the average land subsidence that occurred in Semarang between March 2017 and May 2019 was from (-121) mm/year to + 24 mm/year. Through a combination of VLM and SLR scenario data obtained from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it was found that the Semarang coastal zone will continue to shrink due to inundation (forecast at 7% in 2065 and 10% in 2100).",

        "abstract": "Abstract. We derive trends and monthly anomalies in global and regional sea-level and solid-earth deformation that result from mass redistribution observed by GRACE and an ensemble of GIA models. With this ensemble, we do not only compute mean changes, but we also derive uncertainty estimates of all quantities. We find that over the GRACE era, the trend in land mass change has led to a sea-level trend of 1.28–1.82 mm/yr, which is driven by ice mass loss, while terrestrial water storage has increased over the GRACE period, causing a sea-level drop of 0.11–0.47 mm/yr. This redistribution of mass causes sea-level and deformation patterns that do not only vary in space, but also in time. The temporal variations affect GNSS-derived vertical land motion (VLM) observations, which are now commonly used to correct tide-gauge observations. We find that for many GNSS stations, including GNSS stations in coastal locations, solid-earth deformation resulting from present-day mass redistribution causes trends in the order of 1 mm/yr or higher. Since GNSS records often only span a few years, these trends are generally not representative for the tide-gauge records, which often span multiple decades, and extrapolating them backwards in time could cause substantial biases. To avoid this possible bias, we computed trends and associated uncertainties for 8228 GNSS stations after removing deformation due to GIA and present-day mass redistribution. With this separation, we are able to explain a large fraction of the discrepancy between observed sea-level trends at multiple long tide-gauge records and the reconstructed global-mean sea-level trend from recent reconstructions.\n",

        "abstract": "Catecholamine (CA) neurons within the A1 and C1 cell groups in the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) potently increase food intake when activated by glucose deficit. In contrast, CA neurons in the A2 cell group of the dorsomedial medulla are required for reduction of food intake by cholecystokinin (CCK), a peptide that promotes satiation. Thus dorsal and ventral medullary CA neurons are activated by divergent metabolic conditions and mediate opposing behavioral responses. Acute glucose deficit is a life-threatening condition, and increased feeding is a key response that facilitates survival of this emergency. Thus, during glucose deficit, responses to satiation signals, like CCK, must be suppressed to ensure glucorestoration. Here we test the hypothesis that activation of VLM CA neurons inhibits dorsomedial CA neurons that participate in satiation. We found that glucose deficit produced by the antiglycolytic glucose analog, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, attenuated reduction of food intake by CCK. Moreover, glucose deficit increased c-Fos expression by A1 and C1 neurons while reducing CCK-induced c-Fos expression in A2 neurons. We also selectively activated A1/C1 neurons in TH-Cre+ transgenic rats in which A1/C1 neurons were transfected with a Cre-dependent designer receptor exclusively activated by a designer drug (DREADD). Selective activation of A1/C1 neurons using the DREADD agonist, clozapine- N-oxide, attenuated reduction of food intake by CCK and prevented CCK-induced c-Fos expression in A2 CA neurons, even under normoglycemic conditions. Results support the hypothesis that activation of ventral CA neurons attenuates satiety by inhibiting dorsal medullary A2 CA neurons. This mechanism may ensure that satiation does not terminate feeding before restoration of normoglycemia.",

Manipulation of brainstem nuclei with known inputs to the RVLM (nucleus tractus solitarius and caudal VLM) unmasked tonic glycinergic inhibition in the RVLM. Whole‐cell, patch clamp recordings demonstrate that both GABA and glycine inhibit RVLM neurons. Potentiation of neurotransmitter release from the active synaptic inputs in the RVLM produced saturation of GABAergic inhibition and emergence of glycinergic inhibition. Our data suggest that GABA controls threshold excitability, wherreas glycine increases the strength of inhibition under conditions of increased synaptic activity within the RVLM.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the occurrence of anti- T. canis IgG in children attended at Basic Health Care Units in the city of Lages, Santa Catarina Brazil. Children’s blood samples were collected by digital puncture, stored in filter papers and later analyzed by the Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to detect IgG antibodies against T. canis . Laboratory tests were conducted at the Zoology and Parasitology Laboratory of the Planalto Catarinense University (UNIPLAC). The research was conducted from July 2014 to May 2015, in children of both genders aged two to six years old, residing in the peripheral area of the city. Of the 82 children sampled, 43 were boys and 39 girls where 23.17% (19/82) aged five years old. Positivity for anti- T. canis IgG was 15.85% (13/82), i.e., 20.33% of all boys and 10.26% of the girls. Although the seroepidemiological anti- T. canis data in children at the national level present many variations, it is of paramount importance to know the parasitosis data atdifferent regions of Brazil, since the cities harbor an elevated number of urban dogs transiting in parks and schools.",

        "abstract": "\n <p>&#160; &#160; Global warming-related SLR (sea level rise) constitutes a substantial threat to Macau, due to its low elevation, small size and ongoing land reclamation. This study was devised to determine the long-term variation of sea level change in Macau, as well as to develop future projections based on tide gauge and satellite data and GCM simulations, aiming to provide knowledge for SLR mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>&#160; &#160; Based on local tide gauge records, sea level in Macau is now rising at an accelerated rate: 1.35 mm yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> over 1925&#8211;2010 and jumping to 4.2 mm yr<sup>&#8722;1</sup> over 1970&#8211;2010, reflecting an apparent acceleration of SLR. Furthermore, the sea level near Macau rose 10% faster than the global mean during the period from 1993 to 2012. In addition, the rate of VLM (vertical land movement) at Macau is estimated at -0.153mm yr<sup>-1</sup>, contributing little to local sea level change.</p><p>&#160; &#160; In the future, as projected by a suite of climate models, the rate of SLR in Macau will be about 20% higher than the global average. This is induced primarily by a greater-than-average rate of oceanic thermal expansion in Macau, together with enhanced southerly anomalies that lead to a piling up of sea water. Specifically, the sea level is projected to rise 8&#8211;12, 22&#8211;51 and 35&#8211;118 cm by 2020, 2060 and 2100 with respect to the 1986&#8211;2005 baseline climatology, respectively, depending on the emissions scenario and climate sensitivity. If we consider the medium emissions scenario RCP4.5 along with medium climate sensitivity, Macau can expect to experience an SLR of 10, 34 and 65 cm by 2020, 2060 and 2100. If the worst case happens (RCP8.5 plus high climate sensitivity), the SLR will be far higher than that in the medium case; namely, 12, 51 and 118 cm by 2020, 2060, and 2100, respectively. The SLR under the lower emissions scenario is expected to be less severe than that under the higher emissions scenarios: by 2100, an SLR of 65&#8211;118 cm in Macau under RCP8.5, almost twice as fast as that under RCP2.6. The key source of uncertainty stems from the emissions scenario and poor knowledge of climate sensitivity. By 2020, the uncertainty range is only 4 cm, yet by 2100 the range will be increased to 83 cm.</p>\n",

However, this approach leads to the the problem of mismatched meshes.

COMPASS is a social impact bond partnership between Victorian government, not-for-profit organisations and investors. COMPASS uses linked data in every phase from design, to implementation, to outcome measurement. \nIntroductionStudies demonstrates that young care leavers experience significantly poorer outcomes than their peers. COMPASS is a preventative program progressivelyproviding 200 care leavers with access to housing and individualised support. The Centre for Victorian Data Linkage (CVDL) developed the Victorian Linkage Map (VLM) in 2016, linking 20 plus health and human services datasets with births and deaths data. Linked data provides a critical evidence base for COMPASS. \nObjectives and ApproachThe presentation describes application of linked data for COMPASS design, implementation and measurement. Linked data cohort analysis of post-care service use of 6000 young people informed the program design. Linked data also provides the basis for a stratification tool to measure the complexity profile of referrals. Health, housing and justice payable outcomes are measured by comparing relative performance of participants with a matched control group using linked data. \nResultsImplementation of COMPASS has highlighted the value of linked data in service design and measurement of payable outcomes. It has also highlighted the challenges of using linked data in a real-world environment, including the need for thorough documentation and testing of specifications, calculations and processes. \nConclusion / ImplicationsThe use of linked data for COMPASS provides a model for evidence-based service design and tests the use of linked data for robust and sustainable outcome measurement. The lessons from COMPASS are applicable to other social impact bonds and service implementation and outcome measurement more broadly.",

        "abstract": "Objectives: To analyse the effects of rutile (TiO2) and Alumina (Al2O3) on impact toughness properties of Submerged arc welded joints for low temperature applications. Methods: Al2O3 and TiO2 have been added to F7AZ/PZ-EL8 Submerged arc welding (SAW) flux in varying quantities and the base material used for joining is low carbon structural steel having E350 grade. To verify the effect of these elements by flux modification, the Charpy V-Notch impact tests, scanning electron microscope (SEM) fractography and visible light microscopy (VLM) have been conducted. Findings: Charpy V-Notch impact testing and analysis have shown that there is considerable improvement in the impact properties of welds with the addition of 20% TiO2 and 20% Al2O3 in the 80% of flux as separate constituents i.e., when these elements have been added in the flux in separate form or two new modified fluxes were prepared, where one is doped with alumina and other is with rutile. Fractography of welds with addition of 20% alumina in 80% F7AZ/PZ-EL8 SAW fluxes are having best impact properties at lower temperature and addition of 20% rutile also as almost effective as alumina in flux. consequently, mode of failure is ductile fracture with dimples as a result of good amount of acicular ferrite microstructure. Novelty: Analysis of previous studies implicated that there is lack of significant studies in the low temperature impact properties of low carbon steel submerged arc welds. Present study shows that the significant improvement in the toughness properties of welds at lower temperature of -40◦C can be achieved through flux modification, it would ensure the application of Low carbon steel structures at lower working temperature. The applications may be pressure vessels, ships or containers. \nKeywords: Submerged arc welding (SAW); low temperature impact toughness; flux modification; low carbon steels",

        "abstract": "Assessing exactly the flutter speed and frequency is of prior importance when designing an aircraft to ensure a safe flight envelope and to this purpose, experimental and numerical tests have been developed throughout the years. To simplify the computation of the critical speed and frequency, this master thesis proposes to build a mathematical model for flutter characterisation as a function of geometrical parameters of cantilever flat plates namely the Aspect Ratio, the taper ratio and the sweep angle, on the basis of the unsteady Vortex Lattice Method (VLM). The investigation of the hump mode activation as a function of those parameters is carried out in first place to assess its conditions of appearance and it is concluded that a straight discontinuity line can be drawn on the domain to distinguish the zone where the hump is active from the zone where it is not. Then, the linear regression theory is used for building the model and three different polynomial orders are compared. and conclusion is made that a incomplete second order model provides results reliable up to 99%. A comparison is made with experimental results obtained in wind tunnel. To do so, an excitation system is designed so that its eigenfrequencies do not interfere with those of the tested plates. Several issues encountered due to lack of time because of the sanitary crisis prevented to perform more than two tests for which the different problems could not all be checked and solved. In the end, a proper conclusion about the practical validity of the model could not be drawn.",

        "abstract": "\n <p>The establishment of the Inter-Commission Committee on \"Geodesy for Climate Research\" (ICCC) of the International Association of Geodesy (IAG) emphasizes on the usefulness of geodetic sensors for estimating high-resolution water mass variation, which is due to broad applications of geodetic tools ranging from water cycle studies to water resources management. As such, data from both GRACE missions continue to provide insight into the alarming rates of groundwater depletion in large aquifers worldwide. Observations of vertical land motion (VLM) from GPS and InSAR may reflect elastic responses of the Earth's crust to changes in mass load, including those in aquifers. However, above confined aquifers, VLM observations are dominated by poroelastic deformation processes. In previous works, Ojha et al. 2018 and 2019 show that GRACE-based estimates of groundwater storage change in the Central Valley, California, are consistent with those obtained by utilizing measurements of surface deformation. These studies also show that annual variations in VLM correlate well in time with groundwater levels.</p><p>Here, we investigate seasonal variations in groundwater storage by identifying how their effect is manifested in geodetic and hydrological datasets. Groundwater well observations in the Central Valley indicate maximum groundwater levels at the beginning of the year between February to April and lowest water levels in the middle of the year about July to October. Meanwhile, GRACE groundwater storage estimates peak about four months later. To get insight into the mechanisms leading to this discrepancy, we perform a Wavelet multi-resolution analysis of GRACE TWS variations and complementary groundwater, snowcap, soil moisture, and reservoir level variations. We show that the majority of the differences between wavelet spectrums at seasonal frequencies occur during drought periods when there is no supply of precipitation in the high elevations. We employ a 1D diffusion model to demonstrate that the variations in groundwater levels across the Central Valley are due to the propagation of the pressure front at recharge sites due to gradual snowmelt. Such a model could explain the different timing of peaks in groundwater time series based on satellite gravimetry compared to deformation and well observations. We also discuss that winter rains are not able to directly contribute to recharging deep aquifers in the Central Valley, whereas most of the recharge must source from lateral flow caused by differential pressure at the sites of snow-melt in the Sierra Nevada as well as from agricultural return flows.</p><p>This analysis addresses the question of how well the different geodetic signals that reflect groundwater discharge and recharge processes agree with one another and what are the possible causes of disagreements. We emphasize the need for interdisciplinary efforts for the successful integration of available geodetic and hydrological datasets to improve our ability to utilizing geodetic sensors for climate research and water resources management.</p><p>References:</p><p>Ojha, C., Werth, S., & Shirzaei, M.

Materials and methods: From June 2016 to March 2019, 61 patients with PFPS were collected into the study group, and an age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) matched cohort of 61 patients with normal knees were randomly selected into the control group. All enrolled subjects had undergone computed Tomography (CT) scans in the supine position. The cross-sectional area of the VMO and VLM in the sections of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 mm above the upper pole of the patella were measured, and VMO/VLM area ratio were evaluated as well. Results: In the study group and the control group, the VMO area in the section that 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 mm above the upper pole of the patella were 732.64±306.43 mm2 and 941.66±366.83 mm2 (P<0.001), 876.32±341.47 mm2 and 1119.6±405.01 mm2 (P<0.001), 1039.31±410.21 mm2 and 1302.75±425.14 mm2 (P<0.001), 1178.26±449.10 mm2 and 1496.67±474.70 mm2 (P<0.001), 1289.78±487.78 mm2 and 1643.33±507.08 mm2 (P<0.001); the VLM area in the section that 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 mm above the upper pole of the patella were 127.61±66.74 mm2 and 192.2±152.40 mm2 (P=0.003), 183.47±85.41 mm2 and 262.55±187.98 mm2 (P=0.004), 250.66±133.70 mm2 and 352.35±291.96 mm2 (P=0.015), 326.06±139.94 mm2 and 466.27±343.11 mm2 (P=0.013), 574.19±390.00 mm2 (P=0.005); the VMO/ VLM area ratio in the section that 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 mm above the upper pole of the patella were 0.83±0.11 and 7.44±5.13 (P<0.001), 5.37±2.49 and 6.32±4.69 (P=0.168), 4.64±2.43 and 4.15±1.94 (P=0.554), 3.90±1.55 and 3.96±1.66 (P=0.434), 3.42±1.36 and 3.48±1.62 (P=0.826).Conclusion: In patients with PFPS, the VMO and VLM atrophy was existed in the section of 0-20 mm above the upper pole of the patella in comparison with normal people; and the atrophy of the VMO was more evident than that of the VLM in the section that 0-5 mm above the upper pole of the patella.

        "abstract": "\n <p> The Eifel hotspot is one of the few known active continental hotspots. The evidence is based on volcanism as recent as 11ka and a seismic velocity anomaly that shows a plume-like feature downward to at least the upper transition zone. However, the volcanism lacks a clear space-time progression of activity, and evidence for surface deformation has been ambiguous. Here, we show that the greater area above the Eifel plume shows a distinct and significant surface deformation anomaly not seen anywhere else in intraplate Europe. We use GPS data of thousands of stations in western Europe to image contemporary vertical land motion (VLM) and horizontal strain rates. We show significant surface uplift rates with a maximum of ~1.0 mm/yr (after subtracting the broader-scale VLM predicted by glacial isostatic adjustment) roughly centered on the Eifel Volcanic Field, and above the mantle plume. The same area that uplifts also undergoes significant N-S-oriented extension of ~3 nanostrain/yr, and this area is surrounded by a radial pattern of shortening. River terrace data have revealed tectonic uplift of <span>~</span>150&#8211;250 m of the Eifel since 800 ka, when recent volcanism and uplift reactivated, which would imply an average VLM of <span>0.1</span>&#8211;<span>0.3 mm/yr </span>since that time. Our VLM results suggest that the uplift may have accelerated significantly since Quaternary volcanism commenced. <span>The remarkable superimposition of significant uplift, horizontal extension, and volcanism strongly suggests a causal relationship with the underlying mantle plume. We</span><span> model the plume buoyancy as a half-space vertical force applied to a bi-modal Gaussian areal distribution exerted on a plane at 50 km depth. </span><span>Our modelling shows a good regional fit to the long-wavelength aspects of the surface deformation by applying buoyancy forces related to the plume head at the bottom of the lithosphere. From our spatially integrated force and the first-order assumption that the plume has effectively been buoyant since 250 ka (to explain Quaternary uplift) or 800 ka (at today&#8217;s rate), we estimate that a 360 km high plume requires density reduction of 57-184 kg m</span><sup><span>-3</span></sup><span> (i.e., ~0.7-5.6% of a 3300 kg m</span><sup><span>-3</span></sup><span> dense reference mantle), which is consistent with observed seismic velocity reductions. Finally, we note that the highest extension rates are centred on the Lower Rhine Embayment (LRE), where intraplate seismicity rates are high, and where paleoseismic events increased since 800 ka. We suggest that the surface uplift imposed by the Eifel plume explains the relatively high activity rate on faults along the LRE, particularly since the N-S extension would promote failure on the NW-SE trending faults in the LRE.</span></p>\n",

        "abstract": "\n <p>Vertical Land Motion (VLM) is a composite of several earth dynamics caused by changes of earth&#8217;s surface load or tectonics. In most of the Northern Hemisphere mainly two dynamics are causing large scale vertical land motion &#8211; Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), which is the rebound from the loading of the latest glacial cycle (10-30 kyr ago) and elastic rebound from contemporary land ice changes, that happens immediately when loading is removed from the surface.</p><p>With glacial mass balance data and observations of the Greenland Ice Sheet we have created an Northern Hemisphere ice history from 1996-2015 that is used to make a model for elastic VLM caused by ice mass loss that varies in time.</p><p>It shows that, in most cases, the elastic VLM model is able to close gaps between GIA induced VLM and GNSS-measured VLM, giving confidence that the combined GIA + elastic VLM-model is a better alternative to adjust relative sea level measurements from tide-gauges (where no (reliable) GNSS-data is available) to absolute sea level than 'just' a GIA-model. In particular for Arctic Sea Level, where elastic uplifts are prominent and large coastal regions have limited in-situ data available, the VLM-model is useful for correcting Tide Gauge measurements and thereby validate satellite altimetry observed sea levels, which is challenged by sea ice in the coastal Arctic.</p><p>Furthermore, our elastic VLM-model shows, that the uplift caused by the melt of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) is far-reaching and even in the North Sea region or along the North American coast show uplift rates in the order of 0.4-0.7 mm/yr from 1996-2015. Interestingly, this is roughly equivalent to Greenland&#8217;s sea level contribution in the same period, thereby 'neutralizing' the melt of GIS. As GIS ice mass loss continues to accelerate, the elastic uplift will have increased importance for coastal regions and future relative sea level projections. Unfortunately, the opposite effect is true for the southern hemisphere or vice versa if Antarctic ice sheet mass loss would increase.</p>\n",

        "abstract": "The genesis of syncytial muscles is typically considered as a paradigm for an irreversible developmental process. Notably, transdifferentiation of syncytial muscles is naturally occurring during Drosophila development. The ventral longitudinal heart-associated musculature (VLM) arises by a unique mechanism that revokes the differentiated fate from the so-called alary muscles and comprises at least two distinct steps: syncytial muscle cell fragmentation into single myoblasts and direct reprogramming into founder cells of the VLM lineage. Here we provide evidence that the mesodermal master regulator twist plays a key role during this reprogramming process. Acting downstream of Drosophila Tbx1 (Org-1) in the alary muscle lineage, Twist is crucially required for the derepression of the Hippo pathway effector Yki and thus for the initiation of syncytial muscle dedifferentiation and fragmentation. Subsequently, cell-autonomous FGFR-Ras-MAPK signaling in the resulting mono-nucleated myoblasts is maintaining Twist expression, thereby stabilizing nuclear Yki activity and inducing their lineage switch into the founder cells of the VLM.",

        "abstract": "\n <p>Relative sea-level changes observed by tide gauges are commonly corrected for several components including crustal displacement, ocean dynamics, and vertical land motion. Vertical Land Motion (VLM) due to local land hydrology is a crucial component that observed as localized ground motion and varies with each tide gauges. Permanent GNSS stations are used to measure the VLM trend at tide gauges, however, only few tide gauges are equipped with collocated GNSS stations. Multi-temporal InSAR analysis provides ground displacements in both the spatial and temporal domains. Therefore, in our study, we applied the spaceborne Interferometric SAR technique to measure the local ground motion using Sentinel-1 SAR data. The Korean peninsula is surrounded by the East Sea/Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea have continuously monitoring tide gauges with a record length of more than 30 years. We acquire C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data (both ascending and descending mode) over the Korean Peninsula during 2014/11 and 2019/04. We estimate the high-resolution (~ 10 m) land motion at tide gauges (mm-level accuracy) over these 21 tide gauges and, compared with available collocated GNSS observations. 2D displacements (vertical and horizontal) are derived from ascending and descending mode InSAR displacements. The linear trend of VLM observed from our InSAR estimates is used to compensate for the relative velocity of sea-level changes observed from tide gauges.</p>\n",

Initially, relative sea level trends are estimated at 7 tide gauges stations operated by the Turkish General Directorate of Mapping over the period 2001-2019. Subsequently, absolute sea level trends independent from VLM are computed from multimission satellite altimetry data over the same period. We have computed estimates of linear trends of difference time series between altimetry and tide gauge sea level after removing seasonal signals by harmonic analysis from each time series to estimate the vertical land motion (VLM) at tide gauges. Traditional way of VLM determination at tide gauges is to use GPS@TG or preferably CGPS@TG data. We therefore, processed these GPS data, collected over the years by several TG-GPS campaigns and by continuous GPS stations close to the TG processed by GAMIT/GLOBK software. Subsequently, the GPS and CGPS vertical coordinate time series are used to estimate VLM. These two different VLM estimates, one from GPS and CGPS coordinate time series and other from altimetry-TG sea level time series differences are compared.</p><p>&#160;</p><p><strong>Keywords: Vertical land motion, Sea Level Changes, Tide gauge, Satellite altimetry, GPS, CGPS </strong></p>\n",

This article presents the case study of a home improvement retailer that adopts a vertical lift module (VLM) system into one of its distribution centers. As automatic equipment dedicated for baskets, a VLM system transports two types of baskets, particularly available stock baskets preparing for picking and consolidated baskets waiting for shipping. A preliminary analysis of current operations reveals that the number of baskets allocated for each type is not suitable, resulting in low utilization of the equipment and storage space. After studying the historical data as well as nature of the business, we proposed a simulation to experiment with the effects of the following operating policies (1) the suitable number of baskets allocated for each type (2) storage policy of consolidated baskets and (3) retrieving patterns of consolidated baskets. The results suggest that the suitable level of each factor that reduces the space utilization of 6.67% and vehicles travel time of 37.5%.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Existing scientific literature and international assessments, such as those by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, provide a wide range of projections for global mean sea level rise (SLR) in the twenty-first century. At the local scale, the ranges or uncertainties of projections are even larger. There is a pressing need to compile plausible local SLR scenarios to aid coastal communities with adaptation. Here we develop three local SLR scenarios for Canadian tide-gauge stations for the twenty-first century (Low, Intermediate, and High). Our Low Scenario is based on projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) scaled down to the present global SLR rate. Our Intermediate Scenario is based on projections under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), and our High Scenario is based on the RCP8.5 projections with an adjusted contribution from the Antarctic ice sheet. For all three scenarios, we use vertical land motion (VLM) from global positioning systems (GPS) data corrected for the present-day melt of glaciers and ice sheets instead of the commonly used VLM from a glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) model. The GPS data include not only GIA but also other processes affecting VLM. For each scenario, larger SLR is projected along the southeastern Atlantic coast, the Pacific coast, and the Beaufort Sea coast than along other Canadian coasts in the twenty-first century. Under the Low, Intermediate, and High Scenarios, the median relative sea level along the southeastern Atlantic coast may rise by as much as 0.39, 0.82, and 0.96 m, respectively, over 2010–2100. The proposed scenarios allow coastal engineers and managers to consider multiple future conditions and develop multiple response options, as well as choose the most suitable option according to the risk tolerance of infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "M-dwarf stars provide very favourable conditions for finding habitable worlds beyond our solar system. The estimation of the fundamental parameters of the transiting exoplanets relies on the accuracy of the theoretical predictions for radius and effective temperature of the host M dwarf, therefore it is important to conduct multiple empirical tests of very low-mass star (VLM) models. These stars are the theoretical counterpart of M dwarfs. Recent determinations of mass, radius, and effective temperature of a sample of M dwarfs of known metallicity have disclosed an apparent discontinuity in the effective temperature-radius diagram that corresponds to a stellar mass of about 0.2 M⊙. This discontinuity has been ascribed to the transition from partially convective to fully convective stars. In this paper we compare existing VLM models to these observations, and find that theory does not predict any discontinuity at around 0.2 M⊙, but a smooth change in slope of the effective temperature-radius relationship around this mass value. The appearance of a discontinuity is due to naively fitting the empirical data with linear segments. Moreover, its origin is not related to the transition to fully convective structures. We find that this feature is instead an empirical signature for the transition to a regime where electron degeneracy provides an important contribution to the stellar equation of state, and it constitutes an additional test of the consistency of the theoretical framework for VLM models.",

        "abstract": "Grey matter (GM) volume alterations have been repeatedly demonstrated in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP). Some of these neuroanatomical abnormalities are already evident in the at‐risk mental state (ARMS) for psychosis. Not only GM alterations but also neurocognitive impairments predate the onset of frank psychosis with verbal learning and memory (VLM) being among the most impaired domains. Yet, their interconnection with alterations in GM volumes remains ambiguous. Thus, we evaluated associations of different subcortical GM volumes in the medial temporal lobe with VLM performance in antipsychotic‐naïve ARMS and FEP patients. Data from 59 ARMS and 31 FEP patients, collected within the prospective Früherkennung von Psychosen study, were analysed. Structural T1‐weighted images were acquired using a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. VLM was assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test and its factors Attention Span, Learning Efficiency, Delayed Memory and Inaccurate Memory. FEP patients showed significantly enlarged volumes of hippocampus, pallidum, putamen and thalamus compared to ARMS patients. A significant negative association between amygdala and pallidum volume and Attention Span was found in ARMS and FEP patients combined, which however did not withstand correction for multiple testing. Although we found significant between‐group differences in subcortical volumes and VLM is among the most impaired cognitive domains in emerging psychosis, we could not demonstrate an association between low performance and subcortical GM volumes alterations in antipsychotic‐naïve patients. Hence, deficits in this domain do not appear to stem from alterations in subcortical structures.",

The preliminary diagnosis was thymic carcinoma. The patient underwent extended thymectomy via median sternotomy and complete excision of the tumor.

The excess enthalpy Hex between VLM and other organic acids was calculated by COSMOthermX software and was used to evaluate the probability of forming multi-component solids between VLM and organic acids. By thermal analysis, it was confirmed that multi-component solid forms of VLM were thermodynamically more stable than VLM itself. Through dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) experiments, it was found that three multi-component solid forms of VLM had lower hygroscopicity than VLM itself. Furthermore, the intrinsic dissolution rate of VLM and its multi-component forms was determined in one kind of acidic aqueous medium by using UV-vis spectrometry.

To take a part in this global effort, a morphing study on the horizontal tail of an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) is here presented. This type of morphing consists in changing the shape of the horizontal tail wing during the flight in order to improve aircraft aerodynamical characteristics. The geometry of the horizontal tail was changed as function of 3 parameters: the dihedral (from -80 degrees to +80 degrees), the sweep (from -80 degrees to +80 degrees) or the twist angles (from -50 degrees to 50 degrees). To measure the impact of these types of changes on the horizontal tail, an aerodynamic study was performed using the Vortex-Lattice Method (VLM) implemented in OpenVSP software (distributed by NASA). The methodology consists, in the first place, to develop a reference model that can reproduce the aerodynamic behavior of the reference aircraft with its horizontal tail. Then, morphing models were developed based on the reference model, in which different dihedral, sweep or twist angles were changed for its horizontal tail. Finally, a model able to trim the UAS-S45 for static cruise conditions was used to compute the thrust force required to balance the aircraft for each case (original and morphing). A gain of 6% of thrust has been obtained when the aircraft was trimmed using twist angle instead of elevators deflection.",

        "abstract": "During recent years, all commercial vehicle manufacturers have introduced legally required and advanced predictive functionalities for their on-highway fleets. Telemetry, navigation and electronic horizon systems are the key elements for increasing safety, enabling congestion-free highways, reducing fuel consumption and pollutant emissions under real driving conditions. In this work a novel approach for lane change driver assistance is presented to advise the driver economically to change or keep in lane by using model predictive Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). The system calculates lane change costs considering detected and connected traffic participants for an 8 km prediction horizon. The novel approach applies velocity loss minimization (VLM) and advanced nonlinear online energy optimization methods. This modular approach can interact with existing conventional and hybrid energy management systems. A final lane change judgment is based on the cost optimization of speed loss, gear selection and fuel consumption trajectories. This approach converges to global optimum fuel consumption under certain traffic flows. Finally, the system is applied to a 40-ton truck in a German macroscopic highway traffic simulation. In a typical highway traffic flow range between 75,000 and 95,000 vehicles per 24 hours on a three-lane highway, an average fuel consumption saving of 6% can be achieved, while the travel time criteria remains below 1%.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nFuture liver remnant volume (FLRV) is a crucial factor impacting resectability of colorectal liver metastases (CLM). In case of low FLRV, augmentation can be done by performing portal vein embolization (PVE). However, there is a risk of progression of CLM between PVE and resection. Intraportal application of autologous hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is a possibility to accelerate the growth of FLRV. The effect of thus applied SC on CLM progression still remains unclear, though.\n\n\nMETHODS\n63 patients underwent PVE between 2003 and 2015. In 20 patients a product with HSC was applied intraportally on the first day after PVE (PVE HSC group). HSC were gained from peripheral blood (10 patients) or bone marrow (10 patients). FLRV and volume of liver metastases (VLM) were evaluated by CT volumetry. The gained data were statistically evaluated in relation to the disease free interval (DFI), overall survival (OS), achievement of CLM resectability and progression of extrahepatic metastases. We compared the PVE HSC group with the group of patient undergoing simple PVE.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant difference in FLRV and VLM growth was observed between the study groups. The percentage of exploratory laparotomies was smaller in the group with PVE and HSC application. Patients with simple PVE had a significantly higher incidence of extrahepatic metastases during follow up. We did not observe any significant differences in DFI and OS between the groups.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nHSC application did not accelerate CLM growth in comparison with PVE alone.

        "abstract": "The goal of this study is to design a dedicated, low cost satellite mission for environmental monitoring of the Amazon basin. The mission design is based on the unique characteristics of the small Brazilian launcher VLM-1. Launched from the near-equatorial Alcantara Launch Center, the vehicle allows for direct injection of about 150 kg in equatorial LEO, a low Earth orbit with zero (or near-zero) inclination. Such orbital configuration, actually used very seldom because of its limited ground coverage (restricted to equatorial regions only), proves to be ideal for near-continuous monitoring of the Amazon region. We present a possible microsatellite constellation that allows for high quality multispectral imaging of the Amazon basin with near-continuous coverage.",

        "abstract": "Protoplanetary discs around brown dwarfs and very low mass (VLM) stars offer some of the best prospects for forming Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones. To this end, we study the nature of the disc around the VLM star V410 X-ray 1, whose spectral energy distribution (SED) is indicative of an optically thick and very truncated dust disc, with our modelling suggesting an outer radius of only 0.6 au. We investigate two scenarios that could lead to such a truncation, and find that the observed SED is compatible with both. The first scenario involves the truncation of both the dust and gas in the disc, perhaps due to a previous dynamical interaction or the presence of an undetected companion. The second scenario involves the fact that a radial location of 0.6 au is close to the expected location of the H2O snowline in the disc. As such, a combination of efficient dust growth, radial migration, and subsequent fragmentation within the snowline leads to an optically thick inner dust disc and larger, optically thin outer dust disc. We find that a firm measurement of the CO J = 2–1 line flux would enable us to distinguish between these two scenarios, by enabling a measurement of the radial extent of gas in the disc. Many models we consider contain at least several Earth-masses of dust interior to 0.6 au, suggesting that V410 X-ray 1 could be a precursor to a system with tightly packed inner planets, such as TRAPPIST-1.",

When flying, the hydrofoil presents large deformations which impact significantly the hydrodynamic loads expected. The present work focuses on an experimental campaign performed on a trapezoidal hydrofoil, made of polyacetate material, in the hydrodynamic tunnel at the Research Institute of French Naval Academy. Large deformations up to 4.5% of the span on the hydrofoil's tip are measured at angle of incidence 10° for Re=0.7x106 calculated at mean chord. Vibration analysis performed on this foil, highlights an increase of its resonance frequencies with bending loading. A coupled approach between the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) potential flow code, AVL, for inviscid calculations, corrected to consider the viscous component and, an in-house structural code based on beam theory by Finite Element Method (FEM) is developed for this application. The comparisons of simulations show good agreements with experiments in a large range of angles of incidence and flow velocities.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper customises the classic one-cycle control (OCC) scheme for modular multilevel rectifiers (MMRs) and overcomes the inherent defect of the OCC. To be specific, a hybrid one-cycle control scheme is proposed combining the OCC and the virtual loop mapping (VLM). First, on the basis of the classic OCC and the volt-second equivalence principle, the relationships between the MMR arm equivalent duty cycle and the sub-module (SM) duty cycle are derived. Then, by making use of VLM methods, the switching frequency of the SM is reduced and the dynamic capacitor voltage balance is obtained as well. Further, to achieve the single-line-to-ground fault-tolerance capability and eliminate the second harmonic ripple in the DC voltage, the constant power control is presented using the negative-sequence voltage compensation. Specifically, the whole control scheme only needs one proportional integration controller, which greatly reduces the complexity of system control and the system cost. The validity of the proposed scheme is verified through simulation and experimental studies.",

        "abstract": ", Abstract Background— The number of patients in need of second-line antiretroviral drugs is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa. We aimed to project the need of second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in adults in sub-Saharan Africa up to 2030. Methods— We developed a simulation model for HIV and applied it to each sub-Saharan African country. We fitted the number of adult patients on ART to observed estimates, and predicted first-and second-line needs between 2015 and 2030. We present results for sub-Saharan Africa, and 8 selected countries. We present 18 scenarios, combining the availability of viral load monitoring (VLm), speed of ART scale-up, and rates of retention and switching to second-line. HIV transmission was not considered. Findings— Depending on the scenario, 8·7–25·6 million people are expected to receive ART in 2020, of whom 0·5–3·0 million (2·9%–15·6%) will be receiving second-line ART. The percentage was highest (15·6%) in the scenario with perfect retention and immediate switching, no further scale-up, and universal routine VLm. In 2030, the range of patients on ART remained constant, but the number (proportion) of patients on second-line ART increased to 0·8–4·6 million (6·6%– 19·6%). The need of second-line ART was 2–3 times higher if routine VLm was implemented throughout the region, compared with a scenario of no further VLm scale-up. For each monitoring strategy the future proportion of patients on second-line ART differed only minimally between countries. Interpretation— The demand for second-line ART will increase substantially in the future as countries increase access to routine VLm. Funding— World Health Organization",

        "abstract": "Assigning network resources to Virtual Links (VLs) efficiently and on-demand is a challenging problem for any network virtualization solution. Known as the Virtual Link Mapping (VLM) problem, its objective is to compute the appropriate network paths with the required network resources that meet the quality of service expectations of arriving VLs while spreading the load over all nodes to maximise the admissibility of forthcoming VLs. Despite the efficiency of existing VL mapping algorithms, when resources are allocated and released over time due to the arrivals and departures of VLs, the network inevitably drift into a fragmented state (with nodes with very different loads) often causing a VLs request rejection that could have been avoided with a different resource allocation. In practice, defragmentation algorithms are used in complement to VL mapping algorithms to proactively or reactively (on the event of a VLs request refusal) trigger some VLs reallocation (or migration). In this paper, we propose an Integer-Linear program (ILP) based reactive defragmentation and VLs mapping algorithm for an SDN/OpenFlow network. In addition to selecting the VLs that should be migrated to reduce network defragmentation, our algorithm also computes the paths (and the associated resources) that support the previously rejected VLs. Our solution was evaluated on a real network topology and the experiments showed that our proposal outperforms existing approaches from the literature by about 12% in terms of acceptance rate with a gain on migration costs around 40%.",

In this study, we investigate the problem of a high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of FBMC in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). To solve the problem of imaginary interference in the FBMC system, we use an auxiliary pilot. Then, on the basis of the pilot-assisted FBMC system, a hybrid method of the Vandermondelike matrix (VLM) and clipping with filtering is applied to reduce the PAPR. The input data is precoded by the VLM of Chebyshev polynomials to reduce the autocorrelation of the input signal. Then, the signal is sent to the clipping and filtering module to suppress the PAPR of the FBMC signal further. The pilot-assisted FBMC was applied to the multipath channel model. The performance was evaluated using the PAPR and bit error rate (BER) curves. The simulation results indicate that the hybrid method can improve the PAPR suppression performance of the FBMC system compared with the precoding method or the clipping and filtering method alone. From the results, we can also see that the hybrid method improves the BER performance.",

        "abstract": "Unlike young open clusters (with ages <250 Myr), the Hyades cluster (age ~600 Myr) has a clear deficit of very low-mass stars (VLM) and brown dwarfs (BD). Since this open cluster has a low stellar density and covers several tens of square degrees on the sky, extended surveys are required to improve the statistics of the VLM/BD objects in the cluster. We search for new VLM stars and BD candidates in the Hyades to improve the present-day cluster mass function down to substellar masses. An imaging survey of the Hyades with a completeness limit of 21m.5 in the $R$ band and 20m.5 in the $I$ band was carried out with the 2kx2k CCD Schmidt camera at the 2m Alfred Jensch Telescope in Tautenburg. We performed a photometric selection of the cluster member candidates by combining results of our survey with 2MASS JHKs photometry. We present a photometric and proper motion survey covering 23.4 deg$^2$ in the Hyades cluster core region. Using optical/IR colour-magnitude diagrams, we identify 66 photometric cluster member candidates in the magnitude range 14m.7<I<20m.5. The proper motion measurements are based on several all-sky surveys with an epoch difference of 60-70 years for the bright objects. The proper motions allowed us to discriminate the cluster members from field objects and resulted in 14 proper motion members of the Hyades. We rediscover Hy 6 as a proper motion member and classify it as a substellar object candidate (BD) based on the comparison of the observed colour-magnitude diagram with theoretical model isochrones. With our results, the mass function of the Hyades continues to be shallow below 0.15 $M_\\odot$ indicating that the Hyades have probably lost their lowest mass members by means of dynamical evolution. We conclude that the Hyades core represents the `VLM/BD desert' and that most of the substeller objects may have already left the volume of the cluster.",

Materials and Methods: A total of 13 human vascular anomalies and three human skin control tissues were used for viral analysis. RNA derived from AVM (n=4) and normal skin control (n=3) tissues was evaluated by RNA sequencing. The Virome Capture Sequencing Platform for Vertebrate Viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) was deployed on 10 tissues with vascular anomalies (2×AVM, 1×HA, 1×LM, 2×VLM, 4×VM). Results: RNA sequencing did not show any correlation of AVM with viral infection. By deploying VirCapSeq-VERT, no consistent viral association was seen in the tested tissues. Conclusion: The analysis does not point to the presence of an active viral infection in vascular anomalies. However, transient earlier viral infections, e.g. during pregnancy, cannot be excluded with this approach.",

However, limited perforator distribution patterns of traditional design methods have gradually emerged in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of a new technique (the 3–5 system) on ALT multi-paddled flap design. Material/Methods A total of 151 ALT flaps were harvested from 149 patients over a 26-month period. Among them, 100 ALT flaps were examined preoperatively using a handheld Doppler device to localize vascular perforators. Results By detecting perforator penetration points through the vastus lateral muscle (VLM) or the intermuscular septum and perforator entry points to the deep fascia, precise ALT flap perforator distribution patterns were found. Meanwhile, a 3–5 system was developed to design ALT flaps based on these findings. The remaining 51 ALT flaps from 49 patients during a 9-month period did not require the use of preoperative handheld Doppler. In addition, preoperative handheld Doppler and intraoperative findings demonstrated that all ALT flap penetration points through the VLM or intermuscular septum and the perforator entry point in the deep fascia were closely related based on 3 longitudinal lines and 5 horizontal lines. Conclusions ALT flaps were successfully harvested using a 3–5 system without the need for preoperative handheld Doppler analysis. Moreover, the 3–5 system is a simple and practical approach for preoperative ALT multi-paddled flap design.",

        "abstract": "Order picking is a cost consuming activity. Before picking the customer demands, consolidating orders into batches can contribute to decrease these costs. In this study, we will focus on order batching optimization in automated warehouses, where Vertical Lift Modules (VLM) are used to store and retrieve products. The treated order batching problem deals with the question of how to combine orders into batches in such a way the total picking time is minimized. This problem is recognized as NP-Hard and its optimal resolution is difficult with large-scale instances and within acceptable computation time. To overtake this issue, metaheuristics are applied: The Tabu Search and the Simulated Annealing algorithm. Their performance is analyzed for different instances and evaluated regarding both computation time and solution quality. We will show that the proposed approaches are able to provide powerful solutions that enable VLMs to operate effectively.",

        "abstract": "This paper opens an exciting new opportunity of new aircraft concepts specifically targeting to have higher aerodynamic efficiency than conventional designs through the synergistic interaction between the propeller and the wing. Previous literature on propeller and wing performance analysis methods provide a platform on theory description behind the aerodynamic modeling approach selected. The research effort began with attempts to verify previous NASA wind-tunnel tests (TN D-4448) on a medium and short wing span propeller-driven, short take off and landing (STOL) transport aircraft. One prediction is employed on isolated performance of the wing without the propellers and another is to capture one-way coupling, specifically the effect of the propeller slipstream on the wing. For the first decoupled analysis configuration , the vortex lattice model (VLM) technical tools comparison was made with the Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL) and VSPAERO. Next, the propeller and the wing interaction is predicted using three different coupling methods. The first stage of the work is based on VSPAERO solver which combined the actuator disk theory with VLM. The second approach is to compare with the in house code of blade element and lifting line theory (LLT) coupling. Thirdly, to couple the same BET model with VLM to capture the aerodynamics performance and the influence of the propeller on the wing with the aim to determine the lift and induced drag of the configuration. Perhaps the most compelling aspect offered by the technical tools selected is being economic; low computational cost and time. The numerical computation results of the model presented a good correlation with the experimental data. The aerodynamic model developed will be a strong base for more complex analysis and even greater efficiency improvements for a conceptual design studies of future distributed propeller aircraft .",

        "abstract": "This study compares eight weighting techniques for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-derived Vertical Land Motion (VLM) trends at 570 tide gauge (TG) stations. The spread between the methods has a comparable size as the formal uncertainties of the GNSS trends. Taking the median of the surrounding GNSS trends shows the best agreement with differenced altimetry – tide gauge (ALT-TG) trends. An attempt is also made to improve VLM trends from ALT-TG time series. Only using highly correlated along-track altimetry and TG time series, reduces the standard deviation of ALT-TG time series up to 10 %. As a result, there are spatially coherent changes in the trends, but the reduction in the RMS of differences between ALT-TG and GNSS trends is insignificant. However, setting correlation thresholds also acts like a filter to remove problematic TG stations. This results in sets of ALT-TG VLM trends at 344–663 TG locations, depending on the correlation threshold. Compared to other studies, we decrease the RMS of differences between GNSS and ALT-TG trends (from 1.47 to 1.22 mm/yr), while we increase the number of locations (from 109 to 155), Depending on the weighting methods the mean of differences between ALT-TG and GNSS trends varies between 0.1–0.2 mm/yr. We reduce the mean of differences by taking into account the effect of elastic deformation due to present-day mass redistribution into account.",

In this paradigm, a design architecture is established so that the analyses for the several disciplines pertinent to the problem are handled simultaneously, rather than sequentially. In this work, a numerical tool was developed in order to perform low-fidelity multidisciplinary optimization upon a commercial airliner the B777-300 considering models for aerodynamics, propulsion, structures and trajectory. For the aerodynamic analysis, a vortex-lattice method (VLM) is employed. The lifting surface structures were modeled by finite elements with the shape of hollow tubular spars. For the propulsion system, a model based on empirical data collected from the target engines was utilized. Finally, the system was optimized for cruise conditions, and then control optimization was performed on the resulting configuration for additional mission phases. The performance metric optimized in this work was be the amount of fuel burnt by the aircraft in order to complete its mission. The described optimization processes were successfully carried out, the former outputting the cruise-optimized wing and tail configurations, and the latter providing the optimized control parameter values for descent flight conditions. These values were validated by means of comparison with those of the original B777-300, including that of the performance metric which improved as more disciplines were considered.",

For a given set of camber surface geometry and pitch profile of the blade, the circulation distribution in a uniform or a radially non-uniform inflow is computed by means of the VLM, and used to update the camber surface geometry by the Newton-Raphson iterative scheme according to the differences between the computed and the prescribed circulation distributions. Numerical examples are given to confirm that the converged camber surface geometry and pitch profile are practically independent of the initial values, and the method converges well with the number of vortex lattices along the span and the chord. The present method has been applied to design a highly skewed propeller in open water. The hydrodynamic performance and blade-surface pressure distributions of the designed propeller are numerically verified by means of RANS simulation.",

        "abstract": "Thirty days after carotid body denervation (CBD) in goats, the number of neurons expressing the rate limiting enzyme for serotonin (5‐HT) synthesis (tryptophan hydroxylase, TPH), in the medullary raphe nuclei (MRN) and the ventrolateral medulla (VLM), was 50% of that in control goats (J. Appl. Physiol. 115, 1088–1098, 2013). This difference could be due to loss of carotid afferents per se, or it could be secondary to the CBD induced chronic hypercapnia. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of hypercapnia per se on TPH expressing neurons in the MRN and VLM. To achieve the objective, we constructed environmental chambers to chronically house and study the effects of chronic hypercapnia in adult goats. Following a room air control period, the goats were exposed to either room air or an elevated inspired CO2 (InCO2) of 6% for 30‐days. After 30 days of hypercapnia, the brainstems were harvested and immunohistochemistry and western blots were used to determine whether chronic hypercapnia altered the number of TPH expressing neurons in the MRN and VLM. We found that there was a nearly 50% decrease (P<0.01) in the number of neurons expressing TPH within both the MRN and VLM. Additionally, there was a decline in the number of total neurons within these nuclei, suggesting that the loss of TPH expressing neurons may be from neuronal death. We conclude that chronic hypercapnia per se has a major impact on the 5‐HT neuromodulatory system which is important in the control of breathing.",

Since it was first reported that the blood concentration of CO2istightly controlled, and provides the dominant drive to breathe, the search for the cells that regulate it began. It took almost 60 years for the identification of the first central chemosensitive areas, regions within the brain that respond to specific chemical stimuli (such as CO2or its proxy H+), found at the ventrolateral surface of the medulla (VLM). Since then the debate over which cells in these areas are responsible for detectingCO2and signalling its fluctuations to the respiratory oscillators, has been extensive and heated. Chemosensitive cells are thought to have cell bodies located in, or close to, the VLM with dendrites in close apposition to blood vessels to better detect changes in blood gases. Several candidates fulfil this criteria, including the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) and medullary raphe.",

The propeller’s blades vortices and free trailing vortex sheet was replaced on vortex loops. Because the propeller’s blades an oblique flow moves unsteady, then result thrust, torque and lateral force are varying in angle of rotation of the propeller. Lateral force has same direction as the lateral velocity component. In order to calculate, estimate degree of influence on thrust, torque and lateral force propeller at oblique flow. According to the proposed mathematical model (MM), has been studied numerically acting oblique flow at various angles flow. There is a noticeable increase propeller thrust coefficient and lateral force coefficient with increasing bevel angle, however, the change propeller torque coefficient is insignificant. The results calculation hydrodynamic forces for different angels flow at every instantaneous time are compared with works others authors. A mathematical model of a propeller operating in oblique flow, based on an unsteady lifting surface, allows one to estimate the magnitude of the variables per revolution of forces acting both on the propeller blade and on the screw as a whole. This MM can be used as a tool to study the hydrody-namics of propellers operating in oblique flow.",

        "title": "Role of Alpha‐1 Adrenergic Receptors (α1AR) and Norepinephrine Transporter in Parvocellular Neurons of the Hypothalamic Paraventricular Nucleus (PVN) After Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia Exposure",
        "abstract": "The Paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is critical for autonomic homeostasis and cardiorespiratory reflex responses to a variety of stimuli and stressors. This is accomplished, in part, via dense catecholaminergic and norepinephrine (NE) projections from nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS) and ventrolateral medulla (VLM). NE signaling is balanced by the uptake of NE by transporters (NET's) and the activation of one or more adrenergic receptor (AR). Within the PVN, stimulation of aAR's increases the frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs), decreases the frequency of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) and depolarizes resting membrane potential (RMP) which elevates blood pressure (BP) and sympathetic outflow. Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) is a model for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that elevates respiration, BP, sympathoexcitation and circulating NE levels. CIH activates not only PVN neurons but also the catecholaminergic neurons in the VLM and nTS. However, the contribution of aAR and NET in PVN neurons after CIH exposure remains elusive. In the present work, we determined the electrophysiological properties of PVN parvocellular neurons in response to a1AR activation and NET inhibition after normoxia (Norm) and CIH. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats (110–150g) were exposed to either 10 days normoxia (Norm, FiO2 = 21%) or CIH (alternating FiO2 = 21% and 6%, 8 hr/day). PVN slices (~280 μm) were generated and cell capacitance (Cm), initial input resistance (Rin), and sEPSCs were examined by whole cell patch clamp. sEPSCs were recorded under aCSF baseline or in the presence of one or more of the following: NE (10–100 μM, general AR agonist), phenylephrine (Phe, a1AR agonist, 100 μM), prazosin (a1AR antagonist, 10 μM), or NET inhibitor (desipramine, 100 μM). The Cm of Norm neurons was smaller than CIH, but CIH decreased Rin. Between Norm and CIH, baseline sEPSC frequency and amplitude were similar. Phe and NE significantly increased sEPSC frequency in Norm but not in CIH. Block of the a1AR with prazosin alone did not alter sEPSC frequency or amplitude in Norm (n=10) or CIH (n=6). NE in the presence of prazosin (n=7) prevented the increase in sEPSC frequency in Norm. In Norm (n=5) and CIH (n=6), NET block with desipramine increased sEPSC frequency but did not alter amplitude. However, the magnitude of increase in sEPSC frequency was comparable. These results demonstrate that a1AR activation participate of neuronal responses in Norm, but are minimized in CIH. NET function may be elevated after CIH exposure. The latter may contribute to reduced neuronal responses evoked by Phe after CIH, as well as compensatory mechanism caused by over sympathetic activity.",

According to statistical load data, high manoeuvre and gust loads (-1.0g and 2.5g) occur seldom, but they determine aircraft structures. In contrast to linear aircraft materials (e.g. aluminium, carbon), rubber like materials show nonlinear elastic behaviour. \nHence, the aim is to create passive load alleviation with nonlinear elastic materials. The idea is to increase the performance during low load cases around cruise and to decrease the loading for high load cases. In other words, we want to create a wing which is stiff during cruise and which gets more flexible at high loading cases. \nTo examine this, an iterative process computes three trimmed quasi steady manoeuvres (1.0g, 2.5g, -1.0g). In doing so, the process considers the aeroelastic coupling. It iteratively calculates loads and deformations, using the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) for the aerodynamic analysis and the Nonlinear Solution of MSC Nastran (SOL400) for the structural analysis. Also, Solution 400 computes the deformation due to the loads iteratively. \nThe process utilises a rectangular 30° aft swept wing with a wingspan of 60 m which is close to common long range aircraft. A finite element model with beam elements represents the load carrying structure. A vortex lattice simulates the aerodynamics. The reference wing structure with the linear material is untwisted. To compare two different approaches of nonlinear elastic materials, the corresponding wing structures are pretwisted. This ensures an equal lift distribution of the 1g load cases. \nThe root bending moment decreases of about 3.98% for the material with the stiffer area at cruise conditions.",

Due to the absence of effective strategies in its prevention, treatment, and control, investigation of effective control strategies against the disease is necessary. In this research, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a cold-adapted laboratory strain of Leishmania major (LMC) in the mouse model. Twenty BALB/c mice were divided into two groups. LMC group received 4 × 106 of LMC strain in 0.5 ml DMEM, and VLM group, as the control group, received 0.5 ml Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. Both groups were challenged with virulent L. major 3 weeks after inoculation. The data obtained from the analysis of immune responses and histopathological changes interestingly revealed protection against L. major in immunized mice. Compared with the VLM group, the mice immunized with LMC strain of L. major in the LMC group showed a significant increase in IFN-γ and IgG2a levels (P < 0.05) which are important indexes for Th1-related immune responses. Additionally, significant differences in concentration of IgG1 and IgG total before and after the challenge was observed in LMC group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the immunized mice showed a significant reduction in mean sizes of skin lesion and liver damage compared to the VLM group. Based on the present findings on immunogenicity of LMC strain, it seems this strain is able to induce both humoral and cellular immunity and a significant protection against L. major in the mouse model.",

The beginnings of COBISS usage have been running since 1989 within the shared cataloguing system in the SNTIJ / BIS project. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia and the failure of the shared cataloguing system, several Macedonian libraries have again started t use COBISS software due to the need to introduce new technologies and to automate their processes. In 2004, when a great number of libraries showed interest to use COBISS software, the Ministry of Culture of RM has decided to use the COBISS platform for the development of the national library information system of Macedonia, and for this purpose, in the National and University Library “Sv. Kliment Ohridski “ has established centre of the Virtual Library of Macedonia, i.e. VLM Centre. For the past 15 years, COBISS.MK has been operating and evolving according to COBISS.Net development plans. By the end of this anniversary year, more than 70 libraries (national, public, higher education and special) will be included in the system. The decades-long implementation of COBISS has made it possible for online libraries to be seen, to save and to organize the time in the process of the library materials cataloguing, and to animate the public by increasing the interest in the use of libraries.",

PAPR is defined as the ratio between the maximum instantaneous power and its average power. In this paper, we have presented new PAPR reduction technique to reduce peak to average power ratio using Linear predicting coding (LPC), Vandermonde-like matrix (VLM) algorithm and selective mapping (SLM) algorithm. These techniques show the significant reduction in PAPR without any harmful degradation in power spectral density (PSD), computational complexity (CC) and performance error of the system.

        "title": "A novel optimised design using slots for flow control and high-lift performance of UCAVs",
        "abstract": "In this study, two UCAV planforms are considered based around generic 40° edge-aligned configurations. One configuration has a moderate leading and trailing edges sweep of Λ = 40°, while the other configuration is highly swept with a leading-edge sweep of Λ = 60° and trailing edges sweep of Λ = 40°. The objectives of the present study on UCAV configurations are two-fold: first to predict aerodynamic performance particularly the maximum-lift characteristics of two flying wing planforms; second to control the flow by inserting leading-edge and chordwise slots and analysing the viscous flow development over the outboard sections of a flying-wing configuration to maximise the performance of control surfaces. \nThe first part is demonstrated using a variety of inviscid Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) and Euler, and viscous CFD Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) methods. The computational results are validated against experiment measured in a wind tunnel. The VLM predicts a linear variation of lift and pitching moment with incidence angle, and substantially under-predicts the induced drag. Results obtained from RANS and Euler agree well with experiment. \nFor the second part, a novel optimised design using chordwise slot is implemented on a highly swept Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle (UCAV) configuration to maximise the lift over trailing edge control surfaces. More airflow over the control surfaces will result in enhanced lateral control of the air vehicle at medium to high angles of attack. Four parameters describing the chordwise slot are identified for the numerical optimisation. They are: location, width, length and angle of trajectory of chordwise cavity relative to freestream. The angle of trajectory of chordwise slot is measured with respect to the trailing edge of the air vehicle. The results of CFD optimisation are compared with a clean configuration and verified with experiment. The configuration with chordwise slot has shown higher mass flow rate over the control surfaces of the air vehicle in comparison to baseline clean configuration. It is demonstrated that higher mass flow rate results in higher lift. Leading-edge slot method is considered, but the method improves the flow control for the low angles of attack regime, and is found to be ineffective for a highly-swept UCAV configuration at medium to high angles of attack.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Coupled with the occurrence of regional/local sea level rise on urbanized coastal cities is the possibility of land subsidence that contaminates the measurement by the tide gauge (TG) sensors. Another technology that could possibly check the in-situ data from tide gauge is satellite altimetry. The sea surface height (SSH) measured from satellite altimeter is compared with the observed tide gauge sea level (TGSL) to detect vertical land motion (VLM). This study used satellite altimeter retracked products near the TG Stations in Tagbilaran, Bohol; Dumaguete, Negros Oriental; and Mambajao, Camiguin located in the vicinity of the South East Bohol Trench and Fault (SEBTF). Based on the results, the TG site in Tagbilaran is undergoing land subsidence. The rate of VLM is around 5 mm/year from 2009 to 2017. The same trend was manifested in the GNSS observed data in the PHIVOLCS monitoring station in Tagbilaran and the geodetic levelling done in the area. After the October 15, 2013 earthquake in Bohol, downward trends of around 27 mm/year and 17 mm/year were observed from GNSS measurements and SSH-TGSL difference respectively. These different rates may be due to the distance between the two sensors. The comparison between SSH and TGSL in Dumaguete showed small difference with a VLM rate of 1.8 mm/year. The difference in SSH-TGSL in Mambajao is quite large with a downward rate of 9.4 mm/year. This result needs to be further investigated for TG or TGBM instability or monitored for a possibility of land uplift.",

        "abstract": "Purpose Leishmaniasis, as one of the most important vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, can be seen in different forms and is more prevalent in developing countries worldwide. Due to the absence of effective strategies in its prevention, treatment, and control, investigation of effective control strategies against the disease is necessary. In this research, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a cold-adapted laboratory strain of Leishmania major (LMC) in the mouse model. Methods Twenty BALB/c mice were divided into two groups. LMC group received 4 × 106 of LMC strain in 0.5 ml DMEM, and VLM group, as the control group, received 0.5 ml Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium. Both groups were challenged with virulent L. major 3 weeks after inoculation. Results The data obtained from the analysis of immune responses and histopathological changes interestingly revealed protection against L. major in immunized mice. Compared with the VLM group, the mice immunized with LMC strain of L. major in the LMC group showed a significant increase in IFN-γ and IgG2a levels (P < 0.05) which are important indexes for Th1-related immune responses. Additionally, significant differences in concentration of IgG1 and IgG total before and after the challenge was observed in LMC group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the immunized mice showed a significant reduction in mean sizes of skin lesion and liver damage compared to the VLM group. Conclusion Based on the present findings on immunogenicity of LMC strain, it seems this strain is able to induce both humoral and cellular immunity and a significant protection against L. major in the mouse model.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents the modeling and control design to new hydraulic actuator being developed for thrust vector assembly applied to Brazilian rockets. Traditionally PID controllers are used for this issue but based on discrete models is proposed a new digital control for best performance. It is based on models obtained from closed-loop system identification of a Brazilian electro-hydraulic actuator using Nitrogen pressure-fed system applied to Sounding Rockets and Microsatellite Launcher (VLM). The vehicles are developed at the Aeronautics and Space Institute (DCTA/IAE) and a new actuator under test is being proposed using Helium gas to the Pressure-Fed-System. Traditionally the Nitrogen gas is used in low pressure operation to feed hydraulically the actuator and a new controller is being implemented to improve the system performance. Simulations developed in AMEsim and Matlab codes show best performance using Helium gas dealing on fast movements to the high pressure hydraulic cylinder, increasing the system bandwidth. The modeling of the hydraulic actuator is presented for linear and nonlinear analysis as well as their influences on system identification algorithms. The fluid flow through the internal pipes and spool are modeled using its nonlinear flow equation while the spool linear dynamics are obtained from Newton’s law and the magnetforce from Biot-Savart law. Discrete models are obtained from system identification using experimental data from the hydraulic closed-loop operation while a digital controller is designed based on that discrete models and finally implemented in the loop. A real-time electronic system with digital-to-analog and analog-to-digital converters performs the digital control, using Labview programming environment. The linear and nonlinear dynamics associated to each sub-system are discussed and simplifications hypotheses are presented in order to obtain the Low Order Equivalent System (LOES) to the entire hydraulic actuator, as well as the influences on the predictive control strategy and linear system identification. According to results in time and frequency domain the performance attends the rocket design requirements.",

        "title": "MEMS Micropropulsion : Design, Modeling and Control of Vaporizing Liquid Microthrusters",
        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of small multi-mission platforms such as CubeSats, in an attempt to reduce costs of space missions. CubeSats have been used for different purposes including Earth observation, research and technology demonstration. However, a key technology that is still under development is the micropropulsion system that has the potential to significantly increase the capabilities of CubeSat missions. Micropropulsion has been recognized as one of the key development areas for the next generation of highly miniaturized spacecraft such as CubeSats and PocketQubes. It will extend the range of applications of this class of satellites to include missions that require, for example, orbital maneuvering or drag compensation. An interesting option for CubeSats and PocketQubes is the Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster (VLM) which has received increasing attention due to its ability to provide high thrust levels with relatively low power consumption. The thruster uses the vapor generated in the vaporization of the propellant to produce thrust using a nozzle. The vaporization is usually done by applying power to resistive heaters that could be integrated into the device or externally attached to it. The nozzle is usually a convergent-divergent nozzle that can accelerate the propellant to supersonic velocities. This thesis aims to develop modeling and control concepts for micropropulsion systems to allow the spacecraft to perform maneuvers of position and attitude control. The Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster has been selected due to its characteristics that suit the needs of very small spacecraft. The first part of the research is dedicated to an in-depth literature study of the currently available micropropulsion systems. Those that are manufactured with silicon and MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) technologies have been analyzed and compared in terms of their thrust, specific impulse, and power. A classification in terms of complexity is introduced in an attempt to identify the suitability of the devices for the current trend towards simplifying architectures. The analysis of development levels of different types of micropropulsion systems revealed that although the actual thrusters are significantly developed, the interfacing and integration to other components of the system are still to be further developed. The second part of the research focuses on the characterization and modeling of VLM systems. This is an extremely important step in the development of such systems since a proper model, i.e., one that sufficiently represents the dynamics of the system, is required during the design phase to help, for example, in designing controllers, and also during the operational phase to help reproducing the events happening when the satellite is in orbit. A comprehensive model has been developed using theoretical and empirical relations. The third part of the research addresses the problem of controlling multiple redundant devices allowing failures to occur. This is very important to guarantee the successful operation of VLM systems with many thrusters while performing combined attitude-position maneuvers. A fuzzy control system was developed introducing an automatic rule generation algorithm that allows the fuzzy controller to solve control allocation problems. Finally, the last part of the research investigates the possible applications of VLM systems. An example scenario is considered to analyze the performance required to execute different maneuvers and missions. The key contributions of the work presented in this thesis are related to the modeling and control of Vaporizing Liquid Microthrusters. A comprehensive model of the complete system has been proposed and used to develop control algorithms for individual thrusters and for a set of thrusters. A fuzzy control system has been developed to solve the problem of controlling multiple devices with redundant outputs. Finally, an in-depth literature study and an analysis on the possible applications allowed to put VLM systems into perspective offering a glimpse into the future development of such systems.",

        "abstract": "Despite the growing interest in personally tailored interventions in medicine and health care, it is not possible to reach sufficient accuracy in the prediction of psychosis to date. Many factors are associated with transition to psychosis, such as neuropsychological impairments and structural alterations of the brain that have been shown to predate the onset of frank psychosis. \nHowever, the different disease trajectories male and female patients' experience may contribute to the mixed picture representing emerging psychosis. The prospective FePsy (Fruherkennung von Psychosen) study was a project aiming to improve the early detection and intervention of psychosis through multilevel assessment. The in the following described articles are based on data assessed within the FePsy study. \nIn the first article, structural equation modelling and latent growth curve modelling were used to evaluate verbal learning and memory (VLM) performance between at-risk mental state (ARMS) and first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and healthy controls (HC). In line with our hypothesis, results indicated a worse performance of FEP compared to ARMS and HC and a performance of ARMS intermediate to those two groups. Since these differences were more pronounced in the slope than in the intercept of the learning curve, our results indicated that the verbal learning rate tends to be more impaired than attentional processes in both ARMS and FEP patients. \nIn the second article we investigated whether VLM performance is associated with subcortical brain volumes. A significant negative association between amygdala and pallidum volume and attention span was found in ARMS and FEP patients combined, which however did not withstand correction for multiple testing. Although VLM is among the most impaired cognitive domains in emerging psychosis, the deficits in this domain seem not to necessarily stem from alterations in subcortical structures. \nIn the third article, we investigated whether subcortical brain volumes are dependent on sex. Men presented with larger total brain volume and smaller caudate and hippocampus volumes than women independent of diagnostic group. These analyses confirmed previously described patterns of sexual dimorphism in total brain and caudate volume that are equally present in ARMS and FEP patients as well as HC. The only structure affected by reversed sexual dimorphism was the hippocampus (i.e. women showing higher volumes than men). \nIn conclusion, neuropsychological impairments in terms of VLM and subcortical brain structural alterations are present in emerging psychosis. However, subcortical volumes do not seem to be affected by altered sexual dimorphism and may thus not contribute to an effective prediction modelling of transition to psychosis.",

        "abstract": "The arterial baroreflex is one of the essential negative‐feedback mechanisms that compensates rapid changes in blood pressure (BP) through inhibition of presympathetic neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). There is general consensus that GABAergic projections originating from the caudal VLM (CVLM) provide the primary inhibitory input that controls the excitability of presympathetic RVLM neurons and sympathetic output. However, glycine, another inhibitory neurotransmitter, is also present in the RVLM. In anesthetized rats, we found that RVLM glycine played a critical role in arterial baroreflex function by controlling the time course of baroreflex mediated inhibition of renal sympathetic nerve activity. Blockade of glycine receptors in the RVLM, following an increase in BP, increased recovery of renal sympathetic nerve activity to baseline levels (5.1 ± 1.0 vs 11.7 ± 1.3 min, N=6, P<0.01) in comparison to control. In addition, tonic glycinergic inhibition of the RVLM was unmasked following blockade of output from the nucleus tractus solitaries and/or during disinhibition of the CVLM. Our whole‐cell, patch‐clamp recordings were obtained from brainstem slices containing presympathetic neurons in the RVLM labeled with PRV‐152. We confirmed that in steady state conditions GABAergic inhibition of RVLM neurons predominated and glycine contributed less than 25% of overall inhibition. In contrast, activation of the network produced saturation of GABAergic inhibition and glycinergic inhibition became prominent. Our findings demonstrated that blockade of glycine receptors in the RVLM decreased duration of baroreflex sympathoinhibition; increase of BP and activation of the network unmasked glycinergic inhibition of the RVLM; and release of glycine in the RVLM depended on the activity of presynaptic inhibitory inputs.",

Locally the effects of geocentric (sometimes also referred to absolute) sea level rise can further be amplified by vertical land motion (VLM) due to natural adjustments of the solid earth to the melting of the large ice-sheets during the last deglaciation (GIA) or local anthropogenic interventions such as groundwater or gas withdrawal (e.g. SantamarÃ­a-GÃ³mez et al. 2017). Both, the observed and projected geocentric sea level rise as well as VLM are critically important for coastal planning and engineering, since only their combined effect determines the total threat of coastal flooding at specific locations. Furthermore, due large spatial variability of sea level, information is required not only at isolated tide gauge (TG) locations but also along the coastline stretches in between.",

A Hybrid Electric Distributed Propulsion (HEDiP) system offers considerable promise to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

Fast and accurate estimation of wing aerodynamic characteristics in the presence of multiple propellers is one of the key needs. This need is fulfilled by the development of WASPE (Wing Aerodynamic Simulation with Propeller Effects), a modified vortex lattice method (VLM).

These verification process is aimed to verify the compliance of UAV performance with its Design Requirement and Objectives. In order to do accurate flight simulation, the accurate aerodynamic coefficients prediction is required. Wind Tunnel test is the most accurate method among others but it is not always available. Thus, the computational aerodynamics method was implemented. Among well-known Computational Aerodynamics methods to predict the aerodynamic coefficients, Vortex Lattice Method and Computational Fluid Dynamics are frequently used during aircraft conceptual design process. VLM gives less accurate prediction after separation flow occurs, meanwhile CFD method provides options for modeling the turbulent flows but requires high cost and time. In this paper, construction of aerodynamic coefficients data of fixed-wing VTOL UAV was explained. In this case, the aerodynamic coefficients data must be constructed as accurate as possible with limited computational resources and without wind tunnel data. Three different levels of geometry complexity of fixed-wing UAV were used in Vortex Lattice Method and full configuration geometry was used in CFD simulation for longitudinal force and moment analysis. The result is VLM with simplified geometry was considered as the best match with CFD result for longitudinal motion. Thus, the construction of other aerodynamics coefficients for lateral and longitudinal motion was done by the simplified model. The decision of kinds of aerodynamic coefficients was based on open source flight dynamics module JSBSim.",

        "title": "Norepinephrine modulation of parvocellular neurons of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) during normoxia and chronic intermittent hypoxia",
        "abstract": "The PVN is important for eliciting the cardiorespiratory reflex responses to a variety of stimuli and stressors. This is accomplished, in part, via reciprocal connections to several nuclei, including the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) and nucleus tractus solitarii (nTS). The PVN receives dense norepinephrine (NE) projections from the VLM and nTS. The α‐1 and α‐2 adrenergic receptors (aAR) are present in PVN, and stimulation of α‐ARs increase blood pressure and sympathetic outflow. Hypoxia is a stressor stimulus that activates PVN, VLM and nTS neurons, including catecholaminergic VLM and nTS neurons. CIH is a model for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and like OSA, elevates respiration, induces sympathoexcitation and hypertension and increases circulating NE. The contribution of the PVN, and the role of NE in the PVN, in CIH remains elusive. We determined the electrophysiological properties of PVN parvocellular neurons in response to NE in normoxia and CIH. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats (110–150 g) were exposed to either 10 days normoxia (Norm, FiO2 = 21%, n = 8) or CIH (alternating FiO2 = 21% and 6%, 8 hr/day, n = 5). PVN slices (~280 μm) were generated and cell capacitance (Cm), initial input resistance, holding currents (Ihold) and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) were examined by whole cell patch clamp. Ihold and sEPSCs were recorded under aCSF baseline, and following 10 or 100 mM NE (5 min) and/or the α‐1 AR antagonist prazocin (10 mM). Norm and CIH neurons were of similar size [Cm; Norm, 17.7 ± 2.8 pF (n=19) vs CIH, 17.1 ± 1.8 pF (n=15)], but CIH decreased initial input resistance [Rin; Norm, 2.2 ± 0.4 GΩ (n=19) vs CIH, 1.0 ± 0.4 GΩ (n=15)]. Between Norm (n=19) and CIH (n=15), baseline sEPSC frequency (15.9 ± 1.5 vs 13.5 ± 2.5 Hz) and amplitude (11.9 ± 1.4 vs 15.2 ± 2.2 pA) were similar. In Norm cells, 10 mM NE increased, but not significantly, sEPSC frequency (9.1 ± 2.4 to 19.4 ± 4.5 Hz) but did not alter amplitude. Increasing NE to 100 mM significantly increased sEPSC frequency (19.7 ± 0.7 to 32.0 ± 3.4 Hz) and amplitude (8.2 ± 0.5 to 10.3 ± 1.1 pA). Block of the α‐1‐AR with prazosin did not alter sEPSC frequency (aCSF, 17.2 ± 2.9 vs α‐1‐AR block, 17.3 ± 3.2 Hz) or amplitude (aCSF, 9.8 ± 1.3 pA vs α‐1‐AR block, 11.0 ± 1.9 pA). NE (100 mM) in the presence of α‐1‐AR antagonist blocked the increase in sEPSC frequency (14.8 ± 2.9 Hz) and amplitude (7.7 ± 0.7 pA). In contrast to Norm, CIH sEPSC frequency and amplitude were not altered by NE at 10 mM (e.g., 4.7 ± 1.1 to 6.3 ± 1.4 Hz, n=4) or 100 mM (e.g., 19.5 ± 3.1 to 19.0 ± 4.4 Hz, n=5). Prazocin alone did not alter CIH sEPSC frequency or amplitude (e.g., 14.4 ± 4.7 to 15.4 ± 4.6 Hz, n=6). Neither NE nor prazocin altered Norm or CIH Ihold measured 5 min after their application. These results demonstrate that under Norm conditions PVN parvocellular neurons are significantly influenced by NE and α‐1 AR activation. Following CIH, NE responsiveness is reduced, likely as a compensatory mechanism caused by sympathetic hyperactivity. Catecholaminergic activity therefore is likely important in cardiorespiratory reflex modulation under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.",

        "title": "Combining tide-gauge observations with estimates of spatial sea-level variability to improve reconstructions and to close the contemporary global and regional sea-level budget",
        "abstract": "All processes that affect sea level show distinct regional patterns, and therefore, sea-level changes show considerable spatial variability. This spatial variability forms a challenge when reconstructing global and regional sea-level changes from tide gauges, which are only available at a limited number of locations and are mostly located along coasts in the northern hemisphere. We can improve estimates of global and regional sea-level changes from tide-gauge records by explicitly taking the expected spatial variability into account. From estimates of global ice mass loss and land water storage changes, spatial sea-level ﬁngerprints can be computed, which identify whether sea-level changes at speciﬁc tide-gauge locations are expected to be representative for global-mean or basin-mean sea-level changes. Furthermore, developments in altimetry and GPS now allow for reliable estimates of local vertical land motion (VLM) at an increased number of tide gauges. We reconstruct global and regional sea-level changes since 1958 by combining the expected sea-level ﬁngerprints with observations from tide gauges and GPS stations. The spatial sea-level ﬁngerprints associated with glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and present-day ice mass loss and land water storage are used to detect and correct possible biases due to the uneven spatial sampling of the tide-gauge observations. The ﬁngerprints that emerge from GIA and present-day mass redistribution have an earth-deformation component",

        "title": "Closed-loop Thrust Magnitude Control System for Nano- and Pico-Satellite Applications",
        "abstract": "The growing needs of nano- and pico-satellite missions require several enhancements in micro-propulsion capabilities to enable the satellites to perform an increasing variety of orbital maneuvers. Among them, the possibility to accurately control the thrust would open up new scenarios for nano- and pico-satellites applicability to include, for example, missions such as space debris removal and orbit transfer. This thesis presents the design and the implementation of a closed-loop control system for thrust magnitude regulation in micro-resistojets. This is achieved by controlling the propellant mass flow in the micro-valve of the feeding system which is designed to make extensive use of off-the-shelf components. The Vaporizing Liquid Micro-resistojet (VLM) is one of the micro-thrusters under development at TU Delft and, for this reason, it is selected for performing the tests. The outcome of this work is meant to give insights into the design and performance level of future technologies for thrust magnitude control, which will be designed and manufactured at TU Delft. In order to develop appropriate controllers, a non-linear state-space model of the micro-valve system is developed analytically. The model includes different domains, such as electro-magnetic, fluid and mechanical, in order to bring together the complex dynamic behavior of the actuator. The performance of the analytical model is compared to a more sophisticated multi-domain analysis performed with finite element method (FEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Two controllers, namely PID (proportional-integral-derivative) and SMC (sliding mode control), are designed and tested using the models developed. The ON/OFF micro-valves are controlled with PWM (pulse width modulation) by tuning the operating duty cycle. A hybrid sliding mode control scheme is developed based on the insights gave by the experiments, which enables the thrust magnitude control of the comprehensive system. Finally, the closed-loop control system is implemented in the preliminary hardware design of the micropropulsion system. The experimental set-up comprises the propellant tank, the micro-valve, the micro-thruster, the feeding channel, pressure and temperature sensors and the processing microcontroller. The tests are focused on the performance of the controller, and the fine tuning of its parameters, and also in the validation of the design approach. The controlled micro-propulsion system delivers the commanded input with a response time of ~1.5 s and a resolution of 50 mbar in the chamber pressure. As a first implementation of a control system for micro-propulsion at TU Delft, the results are promising and certainly pave the way for future developments on this research field.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Objective. Fos protein expression in catecholamine-synthesizing neurons of the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (SNC, A8), pars reticulata (SNR, A9), and pars lateralis (SNL), the ventral tegmental area (VTA, A10), the locus coeruleus (LC, A6) and subcoeruleus (sLC), the ventrolateral pons (PON-A5), the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS-A2), the area postrema (AP), and the ventrolateral medulla (VLM-A1) was quantitatively evaluated aft er a single administration of asenapine (ASE) (designated for schizophrenia treatment) in male Wistar rats preconditioned with a chronic unpredictable variable mild stress (CMS) for 21 days. Th e aim of the present study was to reveal whether a single ASE treatment may 1) activate Fos expression in the brain areas selected; 2) activate tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-synthesizing cells displaying Fos presence; and 3) be modulated by CMS preconditioning. Methods. Control (CON), ASE, CMS, and CMS+ASE groups were used. CMS included restraint, social isolation, crowding, swimming, and cold. Th e ASE and CMS+ASE groups received a single dose of ASE (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) and CON and CMS saline (300 μl/rat, s.c.). The animals were sacrificed 90 min aft er the treatments. Fos protein and TH-labeled immunoreactive perikarya were analyzed on double labeled histological sections and enumerated on captured pictures using combined light and fluorescence microscope illumination. Results. Saline or CMS alone did not promote Fos expression in any of the structures investigated. ASE alone or in combination with CMS elicited Fos expression in two parts of the SN (SNC, SNR) and the VTA. Aside from some cells in the central gray tegmental nuclei adjacent to LC, where a small number of Fos profiles occurred, none or negligible Fos occurrence was detected in the other structures investigated including the LC and sLC, PON-A5, NTS-A2, AP, and VLM-A1. CMS preconditioning did not infl uence the level of Fos induction in the SN and VTA elicited by ASE administration. Similarly, the ratio between the amount of free Fos and Fos colocalized with TH was not aff ected by stress preconditioning in the SNC, SNR, and the VTA. Conclusions. Th e present study provides an anatomical/functional knowledge about the nature of the acute ASE treatment on the catecholamine-synthesizing neurons activity in certain brain structures and their missing interplay with the CMS preconditioning.",

        "abstract": "The interaction between fluid flows and immersed structural objects is of great interest in engineering and the physical sciences. Such interactions are often highly non-linear and their simulation requires robust methods of information transfer between fluid and structural solvers. One of the most recent and promising developments is a number of methods based around radially symmetric functions known as radial basis functions (RBFs). This paper presents results of a lightweight and robust RBF fluid-structure coupling implementation in based primarily on the works of Rendall and Allen. The coupling is demonstrated in steady and unsteady flows using VLM and CFD codes. Extensions involving localised/partitioned approaches to the method are shown. Analysis of the effects of method parameters (choice of basis functions, model partitioning/partitions of unity) is presented, as well as an exploration of problem-specific parameter selection. Applications of the method to more general interpolation problems (e.g. mesh generation and movement) are also discussed. Full details of the results discussed here can be found in [1].",

        "title": "Characterization and Testing of a MEMS-Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster for Small Satellite Propulsion",
        "abstract": "Active propulsion is required in order to further develop the capabilities of small satellites like CubeSats. At TU Delft a micropropulsion system is being developed based on a Vaporizing Liquid Microthruster (VLM), using liquid water as propellant. This research presents the manufacturing, characterization and testing of an existing VLM-design. It focuses on the thruster component of the propulsion system, which is called the MEMS-VLM. The breadboard model consists of an inlet module, multiple heating chamber modules and a nozzle, integrally manufactured using MEMS-technology. The heating chamber modules consist of flow channels etched in silicon, of which the walls support silicon carbide heaters. These heaters are suspended in the center of the cross-section. The nozzle is a two-dimensional convergent-divergent duct. Characterization and testing of the MEMS-VLMis done in a bottom-up approach. First, the geometry and electrical properties of the flow channels and heaters are characterized, after which the performance of the heating chamber and the nozzle are independently studied by models and experiments. In order to facilitate manufacturing, minor changes are implemented to the design of the nozzle, electrical interface and fluidic interface. With these changes, successful manufacturing of theMEMS-VLM is achieved. Microscope images show significant but acceptable deviations between design dimensions and manufacturing results. Furthermore, resistance measurements of the heaters indicate partial mechanical failures in 20 out of 154 measured heaters. The thermal behavior of the heating chamber is studied by means of analytical models for conduction and radiation and a one-dimensional steady state model for convection. The conduction study shows that the chamber wall temperature is homogeneous, while the suspended heaters formhot spots. The convection model is used to study whether sufficient heat transfer can be expected to fully vaporize the propellant flow. It is found that at a chamber wall temperature as little as 10 K above the boiling point, full vaporization can be expected. An experimental setup is made to test the heating chamber, ultimately attempting to validate the design and the performance models. The ability to power the heaters with constant current and measure the mass flow, pressure and dissipated power is demonstrated. Furthermore, amethod to determine the local chamber temperature based on the resistance of the heaters is presented. However, current leaks and partial mechanical failures are detected in the heaters during tests with nitrogen gas, which compromise the ability to operate with liquid water. Hence, full validation of the heating chamber models could not be achieved. With respect to future designs it is recommended to change to metallic heaters, which are placed outside the chamber. The silicon chamber wall then serves as a heat exchanger. It is furthermore recommended to change the capping wafer material to glass, so that the boiling process can be studied optically. A second experimental campaign is done to determine the performance of the nozzle, which is described by the discharge factor CD, the Isp-efficiency ´I sp and the thrust coefficient CF . Nozzle performance tests are carried out in vacuum, using gaseous nitrogen as propellant. The pressure is adapted in order to match the Reynolds number in the nozzle throat to the designed operating conditions. At a measurement Reynolds numbers of Rem ¼ 1400 the performance quality factors are found to be CD ¼ 0.68§0.06 (discharge factor), ´I sp ¼ 0.3§0.05 (Isp-efficiency) and CF ¼ 0.33§0.06 (thrust coefficient). The poor performance is primarily explained by excessive friction and rarefaction losses in the divergent section of the nozzle and are expected to improve when increasing the Reynolds number and when decreasing the expansion ratio. Design validation of the MEMS-VLM could not be achieved, as on various aspects the design is rejected. Nonetheless, the experimental approach has been successful in revealing critical design recommendations and demonstrating the ability to test a microthruster, improving the understanding and advancing the development of micropropulsion at TU Delft.",

        "abstract": "La preparation de commandes est une activite primordiale dans les entrepots de distribution (pres de 60% des couts operationnels dans les entrepots traditionnels). Un des moyens de reduire ces couts est de collecter plusieurs commandes simultanement, plutot qu’une par une ; cela permet d’eviter des deplacements inutiles des operateurs dans le cas de collecte manuelle des produits, et de moins solliciter les machines, dans le cas de collecte automatisee. Nous considerons dans cette these des entrepots de distribution ou les produits sont stockes dans des machines appelees stockeurs automatises composes de plateaux sur lesquels les produits sont stockes ; nous prenons en compte deux types de stockeurs : les VLMs et Carousels. Ces deux types de machines, en plein developpement, se differencient par le temps necessaire pour passer d’un plateau au plateau suivant a visiter (constant dans le cas d’un VLM, dependant du nombre d’etages entre les 2 plateaux visites dans le cadre des carousels). L’objectif de la these est donc de developper des methodes pour faire des regroupements de commandes en lots dans des entrepots automatises afin de collecter un ensemble donne de commandes le plus efficacement possible selon des criteres que nous allons definir.Nous etudions tout d’abord un premier type de regroupement de commandes en lots, pour lequel chaque lot sera collecte entierement (toutes les commandes composant le lot seront traitees) avant de passer au suivant. Nous parlerons simplement de batching. Nous evaluons le temps de preparation de commandes, dans le cas ou l’operateur effectue la collecte sur une ou sur plusieurs machines. L’interet d’utiliser plusieurs machines est de permettre la recherche de plateaux en temps masque (le stockeur effectue un changement de plateaux pendant que l’operateur est occupe a effectuer la collecte sur d’autres stockeurs). Cette evaluation du temps de preparation de commandes nous permet d’extraire un critere d’optimisation et d’etablir des modeles d’optimisation exacts pour les VLMs puis les carousels. Ces modeles sont ensuite testes avec des donnees reelles d’entreprise, grâce au partenariat avec l’entreprise KLS Logistic, editeur du WMS Gildas. Enfin, nous etendons la resolution aux methodes approchees de type metaheuristiques, afin de garantir de bonnes solutions sous un temps de calcul raisonnable. Des resultats significatifs en termes de reduction du temps de preparation de commandes permettent de justifier l’interet de nos travaux.Nous etudions ensuite un deuxieme type de regroupement, ou un ensemble de commandes est collecte simultanement mais, contrairement au cas precedent, a chaque fois qu’une commande est terminee, elle est immediatement remplacee. Nous parlerons ici de « Rolling batching ». Cette approche est classiquement utilisee dans les « Drive ». Nous nous focalisons sur le cas de collecte effectuee sur des carousels, systeme le plus utilise dans les « Drive ». Nous developpons un algorithme permettant le calcul du temps d’attente de l’operateur. Une resolution approchee couplant l’utilisation d’heuristiques et d’une metaheuristique est proposee afin de resoudre efficacement le sequencement des commandes. Nous notons que des gains significatifs sont obtenus par l’utilisation de la methode proposee.",

In this research, the authors attempted to test the hypothesis that genetic alterations could contribute to the locations and heterogeneity of the tumor by analyzing 191 WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas via MR radionomics.METHODS191 WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas were retrospectively collected and the genomic DNA of the tumor was sequenced for IDH1/2 and TERT promoter mutations. Treatment naive MR images were also collected. T2 weighted, T1 weighted, FLAIR and Gd-enhanced T1 weighted images were collected for analysis. Voxel-based lesion mapping (VLM), and redionomics analysis was performed for all images and were further challenged to construct a model that predicts genetic alterations within the tumor. 126 patients were allocated as training set and 65 for validation set. Patient cohort was divided into the following 3 groups; IDH mt/TERTp wt, IDH mt/TERTp mt and IDH wt. A multi-regression model was constructed using the training set to predict the 3 genetic subgroups and the validation set was used for model validation.RESULTSVLM revealed that IDH mt/TERTp wt gliomas dominated temporal lobe involvement while IDH mt/TERTp mt occupied the frontal lobe. IDH wt tumors, on the other hand, located at much posterior lobes and centered at the deep white matter. 15 radionomic features were identified for model construction to predict 3 genetic subgroups of WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas. When these 15 texture elements were used to construct a prediction model of the 3 genetic subgroups, AUCs calculated from the training set ranged from 0.7 to 0.75. Accuracy for prediction was 63% for the training set and 60% for the validation set.",

        "abstract": "In this work four nonplanar wing configurations were studied using the VLM method: the wing-winglet, the Cwing, the biplane, and the box wing. It has been shown that linear twist, which is more practical in aeronautical construction, is more than adequate when it comes to achieving the higher values of span efficiency factor obtained by a completely optimized, but highly varying, twist distribution along the span camber. It has also been shown that moderate sweep can slightly increase the span efficiency factor, and further reduce vortex drag. But the most important finding is that the wing-winglet configuration and the C-wing, when both have a ratio of winglet/fin bottom chord to wing tip chord equal to 0.5, give the highest reduction in induced drag, clearly outperforming what is known as Prandtl’s best wing system. Empirical laws for induced drag ratio all the configurations, including the cases of the wing-winglet and C-wing with a chord ratio of 0.5 were obtained. The biplane and then the box wing configurations have the higher values of lift-to-drag ratio at higher aspect ratios whereas the wing-winglet configuration and C-wing with a chord ratio of 0.5 surpass the biplane and the box wing at lower aspect ratios. Reducing vortex drag can be viewed as more important reducing the overall lift-to-drag ratio of the wing configuration since vortex drag represents a much higher percentage of the overall drag of an aircraft than does the profile drag of the wings alone. From this perspective, the wing-winglet and C-wing with a chord ratio of 0.5 are a better choice than the Prandtl’s best wing system.",

        "abstract": "Introduction: The identification of epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, and ultrasonographic and laboratory features could aid in the diagnosis of visceral larva migrans (VLM) in children and adolescents in Brazil. Methods: A case-control study was conducted in ambulatory patients aged 6 months to 16 years cared for 4 years at a pediatric infectious diseases outpatient service in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Patients with serum ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) anti-T. canis IgG antibody titers>1:640 were assigned to the case group, and the remaining subjects were assigned to the control group. The statistical significance of univariate associations between the outcome variable and exposure (i.e., epidemiological, clinical, behavioral, laboratory and ultrasonographic findings) was assessed using Pearson’s chi-square (χ2) test or Fisher’s exact test. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the independent effect of each variable on the odds of the serologic status. Results: Thirty-seven cases and 31 controls were studied. In multiple analyses, residence in a rural area (OR = 4.23; 95% CI = 0.66-27.06), keeping a dog at home (OR = 9.71; 95% CI = 1.02-92.67), and total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE)>1,000 IU/ mL (OR = 2.05; 95% CI = 0.67-6.30) were the most important explanatory variables for VLM. Age, gender, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serum isohemagglutinins, total serum immunoglobulinG, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulinM, hypereosinophilia and abdominal ultrasonographic findings were not different in cases and controls. Conclusions: Keeping dogs at home and residing in rural areas are important epidemiological risk factors for VLM. In the presence of one or more of these risk factors, patients should undergo anti-Toxocara ELISA. However; with larger sample studies should be performed.",

The strictly vertical data design of the BDS brings two common challenges to statistical programming: (1) BDS datasets often quickly grow very large, especially in larger clinical trials. (2) Metadata for BDS datasets become more difficult to develop and understand due to the use of valuelevel metadata (VLM) for describing variables by PARAM/CD and the use of multiple BASETYPEs and other derived data records within the same dataset. This paper will describe the programming challenges specific to BDS and illustrate with examples how to achieve better programming efficiency and quality. The approaches include: 1) designing streamlined programming steps to maximize data processing efficiency; 2) reading metadata (e.g., VLM and Controlled Terminology) directly into dataset creation to ensure consistency and avoid error-prone hardcoding; and 3) using modular macros to standardize common data computations and imputations.",

It is found that the wing displacement can be decreased with the increase in the applied voltage for all wing configurations. However, the rate of decrease in case of backward swept wing is higher than in other cases. Additionally, in case of 3D relatively large wings the piezoelectric effect is found to be insignificant.",

        "abstract": "An accurate mathematical model is necessary for controlling an aircraft. Although the geometrical scale of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is very small compared to the large aircrafts, they are usually designed by means of the procedure intended for large ones, and stability calculations similarly follow the same formulas. This fact can severely affect the basic assumptions of the formulas and hence it may not be suitable for UAVs. This research validates the dutch roll natural frequency of lateral motion calculated by comparing the usual methods of estimation for the manned aircraft found in references of Roskam and Ostoslavsky, and the numerical Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) program XFLR5 with experimental values of real flight. Also a study is carried out to examine the effect of fuselage on the dutch roll natural frequency to examine the possibility of neglecting it through the calculations. It is found that approximate methods for Roskam procedure is in accordance with the exact solution, and the same for Ostoslavsky. Estimation methods of Roskam (exact), Ostoslavsky and XFLR5 give good results in agreement with the experiment, while the approximate methods of Roskam underestimate the frequency. The contribution of the regular fuselage is found to be very small and it can safely be neglected. NOMENCLATURE ωn dutch roll mode natural frequency",

The StopRotor is capable of carrying a 40% payload relative to its empty flying weight. The optimization of the platform for an expanded range, endurance and mission capability relies on the ability to model the platform aerodynamically. Wind tunnel and aerodynamic analysis using Vortex Lattice Methods were used to extract and validate the aerodynamic 6DOF model. This was investigated at RMIT University in the RMIT Industrial Wind Tunnel. The correlation between the VLM and experimental results were favourable and increased confidence in using approximated derivatives that could not be obtained through static wind tunnel tests.

        "abstract": "Indirect illumination on a rendered scene can add a great deal to its visual quality, but it is also a costly operation. Therefore, a lot of research targets how to render indirect illumination in real-time. While powerful techniques for real-time indirect illumination currently exist, they provide only coarse-grained artistic control over the trade-off between quality and speed. We propose a Virtual Light Mesh to compute the scene’s diffuse indirect illumination, inspired by the use of other current auxiliary meshes such as Navigation Meshes and Collision Meshes. A Virtual Light Mesh (VLM) is a simplified mesh of polygonal lights used to approximate the light bounced by the real geometry. Together with the VLM, we design an acceleration data structure for efficient indirect illumination performance with a complex VLM. The use of VLM presents some positive properties: greater artistic control of the indirect illumination characteristics; the possibility of integration with existing techniques such as skeletal animation and procedural generation; and simple integration into existing asset production tools and pipelines. Our experimental results show that artist controlled indirect illumination is a viable alternative to existing methods.",

All launches are selected to be made to the east side of the Alcântara Launch Center (CLA). The dynamical model to calculate the trajectory consists of the three degrees of freedom (3DOF) associated with the translational movement of the rocket. Several simulations are performed according to a set of restrictions imposed to the flight. The altitude reached in the separation of the second stage, the altitude and velocity of injection, the flight path angle at the moment of the activation of the third stage and the duration of the ballistic flight are presented as a function of the payload carried.",

Surgery is a gold standard of treatment in all stage and almost 95% of overall survival at 5 years in localized illness. Objective: to characterize the clinical-epidemiological behavior of the patients, and identify the possible associated variables. Methods: was conducted an observational, retrospective and longitudinal study to collected all the information recorded of the 336 surgical patients with RCC at the Cuban Hospital, over a 10 year period (2006-2015). A Cox regression model was adjusted to study the influence of demographic, anatomical, clinical-histological and laboratory variables on survival, with the consequent estimation of the risk ratios with their 95% confidence interval. Results: The patients was represent to males in 67.9% and white skin color predominated in 77.1% of them, with a median age of 57 years. The most frequent associated comorbidities were arterial hypertension (59.2%) and diabetes mellitus (36%). The majority of patients (64%) were asymptomatic. The classic RCC had the highest frequency (72.9%). High erythrocyte sedimentation and anemia were the laboratory parameters associated with more than 75%. In multivariate analyses survival according to the presence of thrombus in the renal vein, high grade, and capsule infiltration was significantly lower (p < 0.01), 95% confidence interval. Conclusions: unilateral disease, male and young patients characterized the main study populations. Overall survival was high and the risk of individual stratification established from laboratory variables as haemoglobin and erythrocyte sedimentation is an independent and significant predictor of survival in Cuban patients with RCC.",

        "abstract": "Aim To consider if a comprehensive clinical induction improves paediatric trainee anxiety and confidence about starting a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) placement. Working in a tertiary NICU is compulsory training for paediatric doctors. Feeling competent and confident to manage common neonatal scenarios is often a cause of trainee anxiety. Departmental inductions deliver a wealth of information to ensure the process of safe handover between rotations of junior doctors. Rarely, however, are they used to cover the topics most needed by the new doctors or used as a teaching experience. Methods A standardised clinical induction was implemented to a tertiary NICU departmental programme. Every trainee rotated through simulated sessions covering airway management, central access, neonatal life support and an emergency simulation scenario. This allowed trainees to practice essential skills for the job in a safe environment with the department’s equipment and resources including permanent NICU staff. Results Qualitative and quantitative feedback was obtained from a total of 14 trainees over a one year period at two separate NICU clinical inductions. Trainees completed questionnaires rating their confidence overall and in relation to NICU specific situations, before and after the induction [1 (least) to 10 (most)]. These responses were analysed using the Mann-Whitney-U test. In all situations, there was an overall improvement in trainee confidence post induction. This was statistically significant (p≤0.05) in trainee confidence to manage a neonatal airway problem with airway manoeuvres or non-invasive respiratory support and trainee confidence to initiate management in situations requiring neonatal resuscitation. Other positive factors trainees reported as a result of the clinical induction included feeling part of the NICU team (13/14 trainees scored ≥7/10) and feeling inspired (11/14≥8/10). Conclusions Empowering trainees through a good clinical induction improves confidence and experience of working in a tertiary NICU, potentially improving patient care and management. The departmental induction is an excellent education opportunity for all involved.",

        "title": "Reassessment of 20th century global mean sea level rise",
        "abstract": "Significance Estimates of global mean sea level (GMSL) before the advent of satellite altimetry vary widely, mainly because of the uneven coverage and limited temporal sampling of tide gauge records, which track local sea level rather than the global mean. Here we introduce an approach that combines recent advances in solid Earth and geoid corrections for individual tide gauges with improved knowledge about their geographical representation of ocean internal variability. Our assessment yields smaller trends before 1990 than previously reported, leading to a larger overall acceleration; identifies three major explanations for differences with previous estimates; and reconciles observational GMSL estimates with the sum of individually modeled contributions from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 database for the entire 20th century. The rate at which global mean sea level (GMSL) rose during the 20th century is uncertain, with little consensus between various reconstructions that indicate rates of rise ranging from 1.3 to 2 mm⋅y−1. Here we present a 20th-century GMSL reconstruction computed using an area-weighting technique for averaging tide gauge records that both incorporates up-to-date observations of vertical land motion (VLM) and corrections for local geoid changes resulting from ice melting and terrestrial freshwater storage and allows for the identification of possible differences compared with earlier attempts. Our reconstructed GMSL trend of 1.1 ± 0.3 mm⋅y−1 (1σ) before 1990 falls below previous estimates, whereas our estimate of 3.1 ± 1.4 mm⋅y−1 from 1993 to 2012 is consistent with independent estimates from satellite altimetry, leading to overall acceleration larger than previously suggested. This feature is geographically dominated by the Indian Ocean–Southern Pacific region, marking a transition from lower-than-average rates before 1990 toward unprecedented high rates in recent decades. We demonstrate that VLM corrections, area weighting, and our use of a common reference datum for tide gauges may explain the lower rates compared with earlier GMSL estimates in approximately equal proportion. The trends and multidecadal variability of our GMSL curve also compare well to the sum of individual contributions obtained from historical outputs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. This, in turn, increases our confidence in process-based projections presented in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.",

        "abstract": "The global sea-level rise (SLR) projections for the next few decades are the basis for developing flooding maps that depict the expected hazard scenarios. However, the spatially variable land subsidence has generally not been considered in the current projections. In this study, we use geodetic data from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), synthetic aperture radar interferometric measurements (InSAR) and sea-level data from tidal stations to show the combined effects of land subsidence and SLR along the coast between Catania and Marzamemi, in south-eastern Sicily (southern Italy). This is one of the most active tectonic areas of the Mediterranean basin, which drives accelerated SLR, continuous coastal retreat and increasing effects of flooding and storms surges. We focus on six selected areas, which show valuable coastal infrastructures and natural reserves where the expected SLR in the next few years could be a potential cause of significant land flooding and morphological changes of the coastal strip. Through a multidisciplinary study, the multi-temporal flooding scenarios until 2100, have been estimated. Results are based on the spatially variable rates of vertical land movements (VLM), the topographic features of the area provided by airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of SLR in the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 emission scenarios. In addition, from the analysis of the time series of optical satellite images, a coastal retreat up to 70 m has been observed at the Ciane river mouth (Siracusa) in the time span 2001–2019. Our results show a diffuse land subsidence locally exceeding 10 ± 2.5 mm/year in some areas, due to compacting artificial landfill, salt marshes and Holocene soft deposits. Given ongoing land subsidence, a high end of RSLR in the RCP 8.5 at 0.52 ± 0.05 m and 1.52 ± 0.13 m is expected for 2050 AD and 2100 AD, respectively, with an exposed area of about 9.7 km2 that will be vulnerable to inundation in the next 80 years.",

        "title": "Reticular Formation and Pain: The Past and the Future",
        "abstract": "The involvement of the reticular formation (RF) in the transmission and modulation of nociceptive information has been extensively studied. The brainstem RF contains several areas which are targeted by spinal cord afferents conveying nociceptive input. The arrival of nociceptive input to the RF may trigger alert reactions which generate a protective/defense reaction to pain. RF neurons located at the medulla oblongata and targeted by ascending nociceptive information are also involved in the control of vital functions that can be affected by pain, namely cardiovascular control. The RF contains centers that belong to the pain modulatory system, namely areas involved in bidirectional balance (decrease or enhancement) of pain responses. It is currently accepted that the imbalance of pain modulation towards pain facilitation accounts for chronic pain. The medullary RF has the peculiarity of harboring areas involved in bidirectional pain control namely by the existence of specific neuronal populations involved in antinociceptive or pronociceptive behavioral responses, namely at the rostroventromedial medulla (RVM) and the caudal ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Furthermore the dorsal reticular nucleus (also known as subnucleus reticularis dorsalis; DRt) may enhance nociceptive responses, through a reverberative circuit established with spinal lamina I neurons and inhibit wide-dynamic range (WDR) neurons of the deep dorsal horn. The components of the triad RVM-VLM-DRt are reciprocally connected and represent a key gateway for top-down pain modulation. The RVM-VLM-DRt triad also represents the neurobiological substrate for the emotional and cognitive modulation of pain, through pathways that involve the periaqueductal gray (PAG)-RVM connection. Collectively, we propose that the RVM-VLM-DRt triad represents a key component of the “dynamic pain connectome” with special features to provide integrated and rapid responses in situations which are life-threatening and involve pain. The new available techniques in neurobiological studies both in animal and human studies are producing new and fascinating data which allow to understand the complex role of the RF in pain modulation and its integration with several body functions and also how the RF accounts for chronic pain.",

        "abstract": "To integrate and broadcast neural information, local microcircuits and global macrocircuits interact within certain specific nuclei of the central nervous system. The structural and functional architecture of this interaction was determined for the caudal nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) at the level of the area postrema (AP), a relay station of peripheral viscerosensory information that is processed and conveyed to brain regions concerned with autonomic-affective and other interoceptive reflexive functions. Axon collaterals of most small NTS cells (soma <150 μm2) establish excitatory or inhibitory local microcircuits likely to control the activity of nearby NTS cells and to transfer peripheral signals to efferent projection neurons. At least two types of cells that constitute efferent pathways from the caudal NTS (cNTS) were distinguished: (1) a greater numbers of small cells, seemingly forming local excitatory microcircuits via recurrent axon collaterals, that project specifically and unidirectionally to the lateral parabrachial nucleus; and (2) a much smaller numbers of cells likely to establish multiple global connections, mostly via the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) or the dorsal longitudinal fascicle (DLF), with a wide range of brain regions, including the ventrolateral medulla (VLM), hypothalamus, central nucleus of the amygdala (ACe), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), spinal cord dorsal horn, brainstem reticular formation, locus coeruleus (LC), periaqueductal gray (PAG) and periventricular diencephalon (including the epithalamus). The evidence presented here suggests that distinct cNTS cell types distinguished by projection pattern and related structural and functional features participate differentially in the computation of viscerosensory information and coordination of global macro-networks in a highly organized manner.",

        "abstract": "We aim to estimate if structures, such as cavities, rings, and gaps, are common in disks around VLMS and to test models of structure formation in these disks. We also aim to compare the radial extent of the gas and dust emission in disks around VLMS, which can give us insight about radial drift. We studied six disks around VLMS in the Taurus star-forming region using ALMA Band 7 ($\\sim 340\\,$GHz) at a resolution of $\\sim0.1''$. The targets were selected because of their high disk dust content in their stellar mass regime. Our observations resolve the disk dust continuum in all disks. In addition, we detect the $^{12}$CO ($J=3-2$) emission line in all targets and $^{13}$CO ($J=3-2$) in five of the six sources. The angular resolution allows the detection of dust substructures in three out of the six disks, which we studied by using UV-modeling. Central cavities are observed in the disks around stars MHO\\,6 (M5.0) and CIDA\\,1 (M4.5), while we have a tentative detection of a multi-ringed disk around J0433. Single planets of masses $0.1\\sim0.4\\,M_{\\rm{Jup}}$ would be required. The other three disks with no observed structures are the most compact and faintest in our sample. The emission of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO is more extended than the dust continuum emission in all disks of our sample. When using the $^{12}$CO emission to determine the gas disk extension $R_{\\rm{gas}}$, the ratio of $R_{\\rm{gas}}/R_{\\rm{dust}}$ in our sample varies from 2.3 to 6.0, which is consistent with models of radial drift being very efficient around VLMS in the absence of substructures. Our observations do not exclude giant planet formation on the substructures observed. A comparison of the size and luminosity of VLMS disks with their counterparts around higher mass stars shows that they follow a similar relation.",

The existing flight dynamic modeling technique is absolutely depended on the experimental data measured by wind tunnel. It means that the existing flight dynamic model cannot be used for analyzing a new configuration aircraft. The flight dynamic modeling has to be implemented when a performance analysis has to be performed for new type aircraft. This technique is not effective for analyzing the performance of the new configuration aircraft because the shapes of compound aircraft are very various. The unified high-fidelity flight dynamic modeling technique is developed in this study to overcome the limitation of the existing modeling technique. First, the unified rotor and wing models are developed to calculate the aerodynamic forces generated by rotors and wings. The revolutions per minute (RPM) and pitch change with rotation direction are addressed by rotor models. The unified wing model calculates the induced velocity by using the vortex lattice method (VLM) and the Biot–Savart law. The aerodynamic forces and moments for wings and rotors are computed by strip theory in each model. Second, the performance analysis such as propeller performance and trim for compound aircraft is implemented to check the accuracy between the proposed modeling technique and the helicopter trim, linearization, and simulation (HETLAS) program which is validated. It is judged that this study raises the efficiency of aircraft performance analysis and the airworthiness evaluation.",

        "abstract": "IRAS 04158+2805 has long been thought to be a very low mass T-Tauri star (VLMS) surrounded by a nearly edge-on, extremely large disc. Recent observations revealed that this source hosts a binary surrounded by an extended circumbinary disc with a central dust cavity. In this paper, we combine ALMA multi-wavelength observations of continuum and 12CO line emission, with Hα imaging and Keck astrometric measures of the binary to develop a coherent dynamical model of this system. The system features an azimuthal asymmetry detected at the western edge of the cavity in Band 7 observations and a wiggling outflow. Dust emission in ALMA Band 4 from the proximity of the individual stars suggests the presence of marginally resolved circumstellar discs. We estimate the binary orbital parameters from the measured arc of the orbit from Keck and ALMA astrometry. We further constrain these estimates using considerations from binary-disc interaction theory. We finally perform three SPH gas + dust simulations based on the theoretical constraints; we post-process the hydrodynamic output using radiative transferMonte Carlomethods and directly compare themodels with observations. Our results suggest that a highly eccentric e ∼ 0.5–0.7 equal mass binary, with a semi-major axis of ∼ 55 au, and small/moderate orbital plane vs. circumbinary disc inclination θ . 30◦ provides a good match with observations. A dust mass of ∼ 1.5× 10−4M best reproduces the flux in Band 7 continuum observations. Synthetic CO line emission maps qualitatively capture both the emission from the central region and the non-Keplerian nature of the gas motion in the binary proximity.",

        "title": "Revisiting Vertical Land Motion and Sea Level Trends in the Northeastern Adriatic Sea Using Satellite Altimetry and Tide Gauge Data",
        "abstract": "We propose a revisited approach to estimating sea level change trends based on the integration of two measuring systems: satellite altimetry and tide gauge (TG) time series of absolute and relative sea level height. Quantitative information on vertical crustal motion trends at six TG stations of the Adriatic Sea are derived by solving a constrained linear inverse problem. The results are verified against Global Positioning System (GPS) estimates at some locations. Constraints on the linear problem are represented by estimates of relative vertical land motion between TG couples. The solution of the linear inverse problem is valid as long as the same rates of absolute sea level rise are observed at the TG stations used to constrain the system. This requirement limits the applicability of the method with variable absolute sea level trends. The novelty of this study is that we tried to overcome such limitations, subtracting the absolute sea level change estimates observed by the altimeter from all relevant time series, but retaining the original short-term variability and associated errors. The vertical land motion (VLM) solution is compared to GPS estimates at three of the six TGs. The results show that there is reasonable agreement between the VLM rates derived from altimetry and TGs, and from GPS, considering the different periods used for the processing of VLM estimates from GPS. The solution found for the VLM rates is optimal in the least square sense, and no longer depends on the altimetric absolute sea level trend at the TGs. Values for the six TGs’ location in the Adriatic Sea during the period 1993–2018 vary from −1.41 ± 0.47 mm y−1 (National Research Council offshore oceanographic tower in Venice) to 0.93 ± 0.37 mm y−1 (Rovinj), while GPS solutions range from −1.59 ± 0.65 (Venice) to 0.10 ± 0.64 (Split) mm y−1. The absolute sea level rise, calculated as the sum of relative sea level change rate at the TGs and the VLM values estimated in this study, has a mean of 2.43 mm y−1 in the period 1974–2018 across the six TGs, a mean standard error of 0.80 mm y−1, and a sample dispersion of 0.18 mm y−1.",

Data were collected using the Vocabulary Achievement Test (VAT) and the Vocabulary Learning Motivation Scale (VLMS), interview forms, diaries and activity notebooks, video recordings, and researchers’ diaries. Significant differences were found between the pretest and posttest scores of the gamification-based and instructor-led vocabulary learning groups measuring vocabulary achievements and motivation. There were considerable differences in favor of the experimental group between mean pretest and posttest scores of the experimental and control groups for vocabulary achievement, whereas no significant differences were found in terms of motivation. It was found that experimental group’s vocabulary achievement, awareness and competencies were improved; as well as their willingness and motivation to engage in vocabulary learning, use of previously unknown words, vocabulary development, and embracing of the gamification application and its components, and also showed indicators of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. On the other hand, quantitative results of the control group were at acceptable levels, although their qualitative results were poorer in terms of generating themes and being able to evaluate learning progress.

        "abstract": "The recent announcement of a Neptune-sized exomoon candidate around the transiting Jupiter-sized object Kepler-1625 b could indicate the presence of a hitherto unknown kind of gas giant moons, if confirmed. Three transits have been observed, allowing radius estimates of both objects. Here we investigate possible mass regimes of the transiting system that could produce the observed signatures and study them in the context of moon formation in the solar system, i.e. via impacts, capture, or in-situ accretion. The radius of Kepler-1625 b suggests it could be anything from a gas giant planet somewhat more massive than Saturn (0.4 M_Jup) to a brown dwarf (BD) (up to 75 M_Jup) or even a very-low-mass star (VLMS) (112 M_Jup ~ 0.11 M_sun). The proposed companion would certainly have a planetary mass. Possible extreme scenarios range from a highly inflated Earth-mass gas satellite to an atmosphere-free water-rock companion of about 180 M_Ear. Furthermore, the planet-moon dynamics during the transits suggest a total system mass of 17.6_{-12.6}^{+19.2} M_Jup. A Neptune-mass exomoon around a giant planet or low-mass BD would not be compatible with the common mass scaling relation of the solar system moons about gas giants. The case of a mini-Neptune around a high-mass BD or a VLMS, however, would be located in a similar region of the satellite-to-host mass ratio diagram as Proxima b, the TRAPPIST-1 system, and LHS 1140 b. The capture of a Neptune-mass object around a 10 M_Jup planet during a close binary encounter is possible in principle. The ejected object, however, would have had to be a super-Earth object, raising further questions of how such a system could have formed. In summary, this exomoon candidate is barely compatible with established moon formation theories. If it can be validated as orbiting a super-Jovian planet, then it would pose an exquisite riddle for formation theorists to solve.",

        "abstract": "Sea level rise is one of the main risk factors for the preservation of cultural heritage sites located along the coasts of the Mediterranean basin. Coastal retreat, erosion, and storm surges are posing serious threats to archaeological and historical structures built along the coastal zones of this region. In order to assess the coastal changes by the end of 2100 under the expected sea level rise of about 1 m, we need a detailed determination of the current coastline position based on high resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM). This paper focuses on the use of very high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) imagery for the generation of ultra-high-resolution mapping of the coastal archaeological area of Pyrgi, Italy, which is located near Rome. The processing of the UAV imagery resulted in the generation of a DSM and an orthophoto with an accuracy of 1.94 cm/pixel. The integration of topographic data with two sea level rise projections in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) AR5 2.6 and 8.5 climatic scenarios for this area of the Mediterranean are used to map sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100. The effects of the Vertical Land Motion (VLM) as estimated from two nearby continuous Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations located as close as possible to the coastline are included in the analysis. Relative sea level rise projections provide values at 0.30 ± 0.15 cm by 2050 and 0.56 ± 0.22 cm by 2100 for the IPCC AR5 8.5 scenarios and at 0.13 ± 0.05 cm by 2050 and 0.17 ± 0.22 cm by 2100, for the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) 2.6 scenario. These values of rise correspond to a potential beach loss between 12.6% and 23.5% in 2100 for Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively, while, during the highest tides, the beach will be provisionally reduced by up to 46.4%. In higher sea level positions and storm surge conditions, the expected maximum wave run up for return time of 1 and 100 years is at 3.37 m and 5.76 m, respectively, which is capable to exceed the local dune system. With these sea level rise scenarios, Pyrgi with its nearby Etruscan temples and the medieval castle of Santa Severa will be exposed to high risk of marine flooding, especially during storm surges. Our scenarios show that suitable adaptation and protection strategies are required.",

Whether KTS predisposes to cancer is not clear. Methods and Results: We surveyed members of the K-T Support Group (KTSG) and reviewed PubMed for \"Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome\" or \"CVLM\" and \"cancer.\" Individuals with cancer were reviewed for confirmation of KTS, tumor type, location, and age at presentation. Of 223 KTSG respondents, 24 (10.8%) reported 26 malignancies or benign brain tumors (diagnosed from 6 months to 68 years of age, median 41 years), including 3 who were younger than 18 years (2 with Wilms tumor). Nine of twenty-six cancers were basal cell carcinomas (4% of respondents). From 475 articles, we identified 11 cancers or brain tumors in 10 individuals with KTS. Four of these were in children (Wilms tumor n = 2; rhabdomyosarcoma n = 1; serous borderline tumor n = 1). Tumors in adults included basal cell carcinoma (n = 1), squamous cell carcinoma of skin (n = 2), and angiosarcoma, Hodgkin disease, glioblastoma, malignant hemangiopericytoma in one patient each. Ulceration or lymphedema associated with VLM or capillary malformations were associated with some basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas and angiosarcomas. Conclusions: The risk of embryonal cancer other than Wilms tumor in children with KTS does not appear to be higher than in the general population. Wilms tumor incidence is under 5%, and routine surveillance is not indicated. In adults, particular attention should be paid to skin in the area of malformations. These conclusions may not apply to all overgrowth syndromes with vascular malformations.",

        "abstract": "Multi-objective optimization of aerodynamic configuration for a tandem-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) via a surrogate model is appropriate in the primary stages of aircraft design. This study presents an adaptive sequential sampling strategy, which takes into account the principle of entropy rank and selection pooling based on a sigmoid function (ESP), in order to save time and construct a surrogate model database with considerable approximation accuracy. The entire procedure of optimization is divided into four parts, involving problem formulation for design variables and objectives, database construction for the surrogate model, multi-objective optimization with the surrogate models, and ESP adaptive sequential sampling to update the database. Firstly, a comparative study of the different surrogate models is carried out to assess their approximation performance. This verifies that the radial basis function (RBF) surrogate model outperforms the other models across the board. Then, we conduct two tests with typical mathematical problems to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method. We also develop a multi-objective optimization of the aerodynamic configuration for a tandem-wing UAV, aiming to maximize the lifting coefficient at the ascent (CLascent) and the lift-drag ratio (Kcruise) during the cruise. In this case, the RBF surrogate model is proven more suitable than the other common methods to replace the real values calculated by the non-planar vortex-lattice method (VLM) during the process of optimization. Furthermore, a comparison with large minimal distance (LMD) sequential sampling and disposable Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is carried out alongside the optimization. These results show that the approximation precision achieved using ESP strategy is greater, highlighting the superiority of the ESP adaptive sequential sampling strategy in reducing the number of samples and raising the approximation accuracy. Finally, after the refinement of the database, an optimal Pareto front set is obtained to guide the primary design of the aerodynamic configuration for the tandem-wing UAV. Then, it is verified that the selected trade-off optimal design point has a better aerodynamic performance than the initial reference point, improving CLascent and Kcruise by 6.44% and 10.85%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "<p>The global sea-level rise (SLR) projections for the next decades are the basis for developing flooding maps that depict the expected hazard scenarios. However, the spatially variable land subsidence has generally not been considered in the current projections. In this study, we use geodetic data from global navigation satellite system (GNSS), synthetic aperture radar interferometric measurements (InSAR) and sea-level data from tidal stations to show subsidence rates and SLR along the coast between Catania and Marzamemi, in south-eastern Sicily (southern Italy). This is one of the most active tectonic areas of the Mediterranean basin, which is affected to accelerated SLR, continuous coastal retreat and increasing effects of flooding and storms surges. We focus on six selected areas, which show valuable coastal infrastructures and natural reserves where the expected SLR in the next years could be a potential cause of significant land flooding and morphological changes of the coastal strip. Through a multidisciplinary study, the multi-temporal flooding scenarios until 2100, have been estimated. Results are based on the spatially variable rates of vertical land movements (VLM), the topographic features of the area provided by airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of SLR in the Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. In addition, from the analysis of the time series of optical satellite images, a coastal retreat up to 70 m has been observed at the Ciane river mouth (Siracusa) in the time span 2001-2019. Our results show a diffuse land subsidence locally exceeding 10 &#177; 2.0 mm/yr<sup>-1</sup> in some areas, due to compacting artificial landfill, salt marshes and Holocene soft deposits. Given ongoing land subsidence a high end of RSLR in the RCP8.5 at 0.52&#177; 0.05 m and 1.52&#177;0.13 m is expected for 2050 AD and 2100 AD, respectively, with a projected area of about 9.7 km<sup>2</sup> that will be vulnerable to inundation in the next 80 years.</p>",

        "abstract": "Abstract: In this work, the differences in the behavior and properties of the emitted electron beam from tungsten (W) tips were studied before and after coating these tips with a thin layer of dielectric material followed by a thin layer of gold, to improve the emission current density, stability and emission current pattern concentration. The core of the composite cathode is made of high-purity tungsten (W). Measurements have been made with clean W emitters before and after coating these tips with two types of epoxy resins (epoxy 478 resins or epoxy UPR- 4 resins) followed by a thin layer of gold. For critical comparison, several tungsten tips with various apex-radii have been prepared using electrochemical etching techniques. The emitters have been coated by dielectric thin films of various thicknesses and the layer of Au used for coating the Epoxy layer has the same thicknesses. Their behavior has been recorded before and after the process of coating. These measurements include the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics and Fowler-Nordheim (F-N) plots. Imaging has also been done using a visible light microscope (VLM), along with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to help in characterizing the epoxy layer thickness on the tip surface after coating. Besides, the emission patterns have been recorded from the phosphorescent screen of a field electron emission microscope (FEM). Having two types of composite systems tested under similar conditions provided several advantages. These measurements helped in producing a new type of emitters that have more suitable features with each of the two resins.\nKeywords: Cold field emission, Nano emitter, Dielectric coating, Au layer.",

        "title": "Coastal Sea Level Trends from a Joint Use of Satellite Radar Altimetry, GPS and Tide Gauges: Case Study of the Northern Adriatic Sea",
        "abstract": "For the last century, tide gauges have been used to measure sea level change along the world’s coastline. However, tide gauges are heterogeneously distributed and sparse in coverage. The measured sea level changes are also affected by solid-Earth geophysics. Since 1992, satellite radar altimetry technique made possible to measure heights at sea independent of land changes. Recently various efforts started to improve the sea level record reprocessing past altimetry missions to create an almost 30 year-long combined record for sea level research studies. Moreover, coastal altimetry, i.e. the extension of altimetry into the oceanic coastal zone and its exploitation for looking at climate-scale variations of sea level, has had a steady progress in recent years and has become a recognized mission target for present and future satellite altimeters. Global sea level rise is today well acknowledged. On the opposite, the regional and local patterns are much more complicated to observe and explain. Sea level falls in some places and rises in others, as a consequence of natural cycles and anthropogenic causes. As relative sea level height continues to increase, many coastal cities can have the local elevation closer to the flooding line. It is evident that at land-sea interface a single technique is not enough to de-couple land and sea level changes. Satellite radar altimetry and tide gauges would coincide at coast if land had no vertical motion. By noting this fact, the difference of the two independent measurements is a proxy of land motion. In this chapter, we review recent advances in open ocean and coastal altimetry to measure sea level changes close to the coasts over the satellite radar altimetry era. The various methods to measure sea level trends are discussed, with focus on a more robust inverse method that has been tested in the Northern Adriatic Sea, where Global Positioning System (GPS) data are available to conduct a realistic assessment of uncertainties. The results show that the classical approach of estimating Vertical Land Motion (VLM) provides values that are almost half of those provided by the new Linear Inverse Problem With Constraints (LIPWC) method, in a new formulation which makes use of a change of variable (LIPWCCOV). Moreover, the accuracy of the new VLM estimates is lower when compared to the VLM estimated from GPS measurements. The experimental Sea Level Climate Change Initiative (SLCCI) data set (high resolution along track) coastal sea level product (developed within Climate Change Initiative (CCI project) that has been also assessed in the Gulf of Trieste show that the trends calculated with the gridded and along track datasets exhibit some differences, probably due to the different methodologies used in the generation of the products.",

        "title": "Design of in-Depth Conformance Gel Treatment to De-Risk ASP Flooding in a Major Carbonate Reservoir",
        "abstract": "\n Mature carbonate reservoirs under waterflood in Kuwait suffer from relatively low oil recovery due to poor sweep efficiency, both areal and microscopic. An Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) pilot is in progress targeting the Sabriyah Mauddud (SAMA) reservoir in pursuit of reserves growth and production sustainability. SAMA suffers from reservoir heterogeneities mainly associated with permeability contrast which may be improved with a conformance treatment to de-risk pre-mature breakthrough of water and chemical EOR agents in preparation for subsequent ASP injection and to improve reservoir contact by the injected fluids. Design of the gel conformance treatment was multi-faceted. Rapid breakthrough of tracers at the pilot producer from each of the individual injectors, less than 3 days, implied a direct connection from the injectors to the producer and poses significant risk to the success of the pilot. A dynamic model of the SAMA pilot was used to estimate in the potential injection of either a high viscous polymer solution (~200 cp) or a gel conformance treatment to improve contact efficiency, diverting injected fluid into oil saturated reservoir matrix. High viscosity polymer injection scenarios were simulated in the extracted subsector model and showed little to no effect on diverting fluids from the high permeability streak into the matrix. Gel conformance treatment, however, provides benefit to the SAMA pilot with important limitations. Gel treatment diverts injected fluid from the high permeability zone into lower permeability, higher oil saturated reservoir. After a gel treatment, the ASP increases the oil cut from 3% to 75% while increasing the cumulative oil recovery by more than 50 MSTB oil over ASP following a high viscosity polymer slug alone. Laboratory design of the gel conformance system for the SAMA ASP pilot involved blending of two polymer types (AN 125SH, an ATBS type polymer, and P320 VLM and P330, synthetic copolymers) and two crosslinkers (chromium acetate and X1050, an organic crosslinker). Bulk testing with the polymer-crosslinker combinations indicated that SAMA reservoir brine resulted in not gel system that would work in the SAMA reservoir, resulting in the recommendation of using 2% KCl in treated water for gel formulation. AN 125 SH with S1050 produce good gels but with short gelation times and AS 125 SH with chromium acetate developed low gels consistency in both waters. P330 and P320 VLM gave good gels with slow gelation times with X1050 crosslinker in 2% KCl. Corefloods with the P330-X 1050 showed good injectivity and ultimately a reduction of permeability of about 200-fold. A P330-X 1050 was recommended for numerical simulation studies. Numerical simulator was calibrated by matching bulk gel viscosity increases and coreflood permeability changes. Numerical simulation indicated two of the four injection wells (SA-0557 and SA-0559) injection profile will change compared to water. Overall injection rate was reduced by the conformance treatment and was the corresponding oil rate. Total oil production from the center pilot production well (SA-0560) decreased with gel treatment but ultimately increased to greater rates",

        "abstract": "Model transformation (MT) of very large models (VLMs), with millions of elements, is a challenging cornerstone for applying Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) technology in industry. Recent research efforts that tackle this problem have been directed at distributing MT on the Cloud, either directly, by managing clusters explicitly, or indirectly, via external NoSQL data stores. In this paper, we draw attention back to improving efficiency of model transformations that use EMF natively and that run on non-distributed environments, showing that substantial performance gains can still be reaped on that ground. We present Yet Another Model Transformation Language (YAMTL), a new internal domain-specific language (DSL) of Xtend for defining declarative MT, and its execution engine. The part of the DSL for defining MT is similar to ATL in terms of expressiveness, including support for advanced modelling contructs, such as multiple rule inheritance and module composition. In addition, YAMTL provides support for specifying execution control strategies. We experimentally demonstrate that the presented transformation engine outperforms other representative MT engines by using the batch transformation component of the VIATRA CPS benchmark. The improvement is, at least, one order of magnitude over the up-to-now fastest solution in all of the assessed scenarios.

We assessed the reliability, quality, and performance of these missions by comparing eight tide gauge (TG) stations along the Indian coast. These are Okha, Mumbai, Karwar, and Cochin stations in the Arabian Sea, and Nagapattinam, Chennai, Visakhapatnam, and Paradip in the Bay of Bengal. To compare the satellite altimetry and TG sea level time series, both datasets are transformed to the same reference datum. Before the calculation of the bias between the altimetry and TG sea level time series, TG data are corrected for Inverted Barometer (IB) and Dynamic Atmospheric Correction (DAC). Since there are no prior VLM measurements in our study area, VLM is calculated from TG records using the same procedure as in the Technical Report NOS organization CO-OPS 065.&#160;</p><p>Keywords&#8212; Tide gauge, Sea level, North Indian ocean, satellite altimetry, Vertical land motion</p>",

        "abstract": "The primary goal in development of MAVs is to develop a flying body that weigh as less as 90 grams, with a span of 15cm [1]. Since it is challenging to meet these design characteristics of a MAVs with current technology, there has been a lot of research going on in this direction. This paper is also a continuation of the same quest. In this research a delta wing micro air vehicle was analyzed at low sub sonic speed at different angles of attack for determining lift, drag force, stall angle and L/D ratio. CFD and XFLR have been used as computational tools. For CFD analysis, a far field technique was used to calculate the lift and drag coefficients. Rectangular domain was created around the body with a size 10 times greater than body so that flow behavior can be captured accurately. Inflation layers were created around the body to capture boundary layer. Fine mesh was created at the regions of higher gradients. In fluent flow was analyzed using two turbulent models (SA and k-ε). A potential flow solver (XFLR) was also used to compare results from RANS methodology with vortex lattice method (VLM). Validation of computational results was carried out by comparing with earlier research concerning wind tunnel testing of MAV [2] at 100,000 Re. This research will help the aero dynamists to understand the complete procedure of computational and XFLR analysis of MAVs. It was found that XFLR predicts higher values of lift coefficient and lower values of drag coefficient at all angles of attack. Consequently, lift to drag ratio as predicted by XFLR was found greater than RANS models. Further no appreciable difference was noticed between lift and drag characteristics predicted by SA and k-ε models.",

        "abstract": "\n In order to improve the physical interpretation about innermost dusty regions in protoplanetary discs around brown dwarf (BD), and even very low mass star (VLMS), we present a grid of models taking into account two different sets: (i) The set called standard model, that simulates an axisymmetric dusty disc with an inner curved wall. (ii) The perturbed one called non-standard where the axisymmetry of the inner edge has been broken. We have achieved a fitting for the disc structure able to explain the spectral energy distribution (SED). As the main condition, we assume that the changes of the inner wall geometry in the tongue-like shape depend on the Rayleigh–Taylor instability (R-TIns) generated in the inner disc edge. For each object, we parametrize the shape of the inner wall to find a time-dependent model that enables us to explain the photometric near-Infrared variability and connect the changes on the inner disc structure with the amplitude of such variability. We re-analysed photometric measurements from near to mid-infrared wavelengths of a sample of 6 BDs and one VLMS in different cloud associations which were previously studied by other authors. We also show that the flux change calculated between the non-standard and the standard configurations models the observed variability in LRLL 1679. The magnitude changes due to these fluctuations slightly depend on the wavelength and they can present differences of up to 0.9 mag. We suggest that if the R-TIns persist enough time, the features in the protoplanetary inner disc, e.g. inner holes or gaps evolve.",

        "abstract": "A hallmark of respiratory‐related diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is chronic hypercapnia (CH). Common therapeutic intervention for patients experiencing CH is mechanical ventilation to restore blood‐gas homeostasis. While many neurophysiological consequences of CH have been characterized, little is known about the effects reversing CH. The primary goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that abrupt deacclimatization from CH would significantly alter markers of neuroplasticity and tryptophan metabolism, but not levels of excitatory neuromodulators. Utilizing our goat model of increased inspired CO2 (InCO2)‐induced CH, adult female goats were exposed to an InCO2 of 6% for 30 days (d) followed by a return to room air for 24 hours (h). Following 24h of recovery, goats were euthanized, and brainstems were rapidly extracted. Tissue punches of key nuclei throughout the brainstem respiratory network (hypoglossal motor nucleus (XII), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS)/dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), ventral respiratory column (VRC), medullary raphe (MR), ventrolateral medulla (VLM), retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), and cuneate nucleus (CN)) were obtained and used for either western blot or HPLC analysis. Changes in glutamatergic signaling, neuroinflammation, tryptophan metabolism, and neuromodulators concentration, following recovery from CH, were assessed. Following 24h of recovery, there were no significant differences in AMPA or NMDA receptor expression or phosphorylation, compared to room air control goats, across all nuclei investigated. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the inflammatory cytokine IL1B following 24h recovery across all nuclei investigated, compared to room air control goats. However, there was significantly (P<0.05) lower expression of key enzymes of tryptophan metabolism (Indolamine 2,3‐dioxygenase (IDO); Tryptophan Hydroxylase (TPH) and neuronal markers (NeuN) compared to control within the rostral VLM and MR. Within the solitary complex (NTS & DMV), there was significantly (P>0.05) greater concentrations in norepinephrine (+132%±49), serotonin (+348%±142), and dopamine (+86%±53) at 24h of recovery compared to 30d of CH. We conclude that although specific markers of neuroplasticity and neuroinflammation were unchanged from control during deacclimatization, there were brainstem‐site dependent changes in excitatory neuromodulators during deacclimatization from CH. These data suggest that the mechanisms of neuroplasticity during acclimatization to‐ and deacclimatization from‐ CH are fundamentally different.",

Flooding events are expected to grow in frequency and magnitude, increasing the potential 10 economic losses and costs of adaptation. In Italy, a large share of the population and economic activities are 11 located along the coast of the peninsula, although risk of inundation is not uniformly distributed. The low12 lying coastal plain of Northeast Italy is the most sensitive to relative sea level changes. Over the last half a 13 century, the entire north-eastern Italian coast has experienced a significant rise in relative sea level, the main 14 component of which was land subsidence. In the forthcoming decades, sea level rise is expected to become the 15 first driver of coastal inundation hazard. We propose an assessment of flood hazard and risk linked with 16 extreme sea level scenarios, both under historical conditions and sea level rise projections at 2050 and 2100. 17 We run a hydrodynamic inundation model on two pilot sites located in the North Adriatic Sea along the 18 Emilia-Romagna coast: Rimini and Cesenatico. Here, we compare alternative risk scenarios accounting for the 19 effect of planned and hypothetical seaside renovation projects against the historical baseline. We apply a flood 20 damage model developed for Italy to estimate the potential economic damage linked to flood scenarios and 21 we calculate the change in expected annual damage according to changes in the relative sea level. Finally, 22 damage reduction benefits are evaluated by means of cost-benefit analysis. Results suggest an overall 23 profitability of the investigated projects over time, with increasing benefits due to increased probability of 24 intense flooding in the next future. 25 Key-words: coastal inundation Italy extreme sea level rise 26 Abbreviations: MSL (Mean Sea Level); TWL (Total Water Level); ESL (Extreme Sea Level); SLR (Sea Level 27 Rise); VLM (Vertical Land Movements); DTM (Digital Terrain Model); EAD (Expected Annual Damage) 28",

        "abstract": "Inflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients suggests that inflammasomes, proinflammatory intracellular complexes, regulate various steps of infection. Lung epithelial cells express inflammasome-forming sensors and constitute the primary entry door of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we describe that the NLRP1 inflammasome detects SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung epithelial cells. Specifically, human NLRP1 is cleaved at the Q333 site by multiple coronavirus 3CL proteases, which triggers inflammasome assembly, cell death and limits the production of infectious viral particles. Analysis of NLRP1-associated pathways unveils that 3CL proteases also cleave and inactivate the pyroptosis executioner Gasdermin (GSDM)-D. Consequently, Caspase-3 and GSDM-E promote alternative cell pyroptosis, a process exacerbated in cells exhibiting imparied type I interferon production. Finally, analysis of pyroptosis markers in plasma from COVID-19 patients with characterized severe pneumonia due to Interferon alterations identify GSDM-E/Caspase-3 as biological markers of disease severity.

        "title": "A review and technical perspective towards the role of UAV as a mode of transport in healthcare sector in India",
        "abstract": "This paper describes the technical and legal sides of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and its operations for emergency medical situations like accidents, emergency hospitalization etc. in India. It highlights the details about mode of operations like flight aerodynamics, types of payloads, aircraft launching and landing system, payload dropping mechanisms, powerplant selection, etc. In 2018, The Director General of Civil Aviation of Government of India announces new policies for Remotely Piloted Unmanned Systems. According to these policies, designing and operating the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle in Indian air space becomes somewhat easier than before. Although, these regulations cannot give complete freedom of what designer and operator wants in their Unmanned Aerial Systems but, it helps to design the Unmanned Aerial System with systematic approach from the foundation stage. India is the 2nd most populated country in the world with poor health sector. Because of this high densely population, it is difficult to treat every needful person. Many accident cases are registered daily in India and maximum of them lost their lives just because of lack of treatment at early stages. Even ambulance takes 20 to 40 minutes of time to reach at accidental place by road (In rural area that too is not possible). If we can be able to provide the necessary treatments like first aid treatment, medicines, living organs, blood etc. by Aerial route (within 5-7 minutes) then it is possible to save the life of many peoples across the country. This project is trying to mention the details about unmanned aerial system which can solve this problem and help provide the treatment in medical emergencies. keywords Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Unmanned Aerial System, Medical emergency, DGCA, RPAS. _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ I.INTRODUCTION The term Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was first introduced in the 1980s which defines, an autonomous or remotely piloted, multirole aircraft which can carry a payload or performing any task like surveillance without direct interference of humans. This definition makes UAV different from other aerial vehicles such as airplanes, helicopters, missiles, gliders, balloons etc. The UAS, refers to the system in which one or more unmanned aerial vehicles in combination with payloads, a navigations and control system, sensors, instruments and data linkages working together to operate the vehicle without pilot. Other term used to refer UAS is remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). From recent years, implementation of UAS was seen widely in land survey, urban planning and development, mapping, mining industry, archaeology, environment protection, disaster management, aerial photography, construction etc. Because of affordable in cost, great performance and time saving ability, UAVs are highly demanded in market. UAVs was utilized for military purposes at their initial period. The first successful radio control aircraft took-off in 1924. Through the development of software and electronics and the mass production of processors, sensors, and batteries produced for electronic devices, UAV designs have become easier, more affordable and more accessible and hence this began to utilize UAVs for commercial world. Currently, plenty of nations like USA, European union, Israel, India, China and so on are utilizing UAVs in their military and civil operations. This review article aims to highlight the importance and applications regarding the use of small UAVs to transport blood and medicines from blood banks/medical stores to critical access hospitals, accidental place in times of critical and emergency situation. This technology has the potential to benefit peoples in distant areas. Just like other sectors, health sector also has the best usage of UAVs to improve their services. Transportation is huge barrier in delivery of medicines and vaccines in distant or high densely populated areas in countries like India. UAVs can be the best alternative in case of any emergencies for the transportation of medicines in such areas. It may be a quick means of transportation of medicines and other facilities. This system will be affordable cost of transportation for medical facilities. The contribution of UAVs for caring of patients, accident victims in the manner to provide immediate medicines, blood in less time for assess can save someone’s life. Some hospitals in Switzerland started using rotor wing UAVs (Figure-1) to deliver the blood samples and other medicines. This step helps many peoples in Switzerland to save their lives. This UAVs are capable of carrying payloads up to 2 kg and move at velocity up to 57.6 km/h at an altitude of 110 m and the range up to 20 km. This UAVs are equipped with parachute so that in case of any damage occurs in air, the UAVs are able to land safely without harming others as well as cargo inside it. The medicine delivery start-up Zipline from African country – Rwanda, uses fixed wing UAVs (Figure-2) to deliver the blood and medicines. Its UAVs has operating range of 80 km and move at speed of 100 km/h making it one of the innovative and Publication Since 2012 | ISSN: 2321-9939 | ©IJEDR 2021 Year 2021, Volume 9, Issue 1 IJEDR2101021 International Journal of Engineering Development and Research (www.ijedr.org) 171 successful Unmanned Aerial System. The medicines are dropped at delivery location with the help of parachutes. The UAV can carry 1.75 kg of payload. It was in service from the year 2016. Fig-1 Rotor wing UAV by Swiss post [1] Fig-2 Fixed wing UAV by Zipline [2] At present, medical supplies in the United States of America (USA) are delivered by conventional road transport as well as airplanes and helicopters. The availability of blood and other medicines is limited during emergencies at critical access hospitals, due to this, conventional mode of transportation may become disrupted. II. METHODOLOGY A research study was conducted on available scientific papers and journals related to this topic. Some information was collected from official website of drone companies which are working in this field with successful results. Since research into the implementation of UAVs in health sector around the globe is at initial stage, literature survey was conducting on limited available sources. Design Tushar et.al (2020) discussed about Aerodynamic characterization of Albatross Inspired wing for UAVs [3]. In the paper author elaborated detailed design analysis on the aerodynamics of wing which can bear high lift to weight ratio. UAVs having High payload fraction are eligible to carry more payloads. Wing is most important part of fixed wing aircraft for their contribution of generating the lift. According to requirements and applications of UAV, its wing shape and other characteristics differs. Similarly, for the stability, empennage plays an important role. The software which was used for design and simulations was XFLR5. It uses 3D panel and Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) for analysis and results. By considering all aerodynamic geometries of designed UAV like wing span, aspect ratio and wing area for main wing, horizontal tail and vertical tail at constant flight speed, the aerodynamic analysis was performed. The design objective is accomplished by obtaining the graph of lift coefficient versus angle of attack, lift coefficient versus drag coefficient and ratio of Lift to Drag coefficient versus angle of attack which defines the lift characteristics of wing in order to obtain the maximum lift enhancing design requirement carrying highest payload. Fuselage which satisfies the condition to hold and release the cargo by launch and drop mechanism. Also, fuselage should not make big disturbance on wing to act against lift. Some more bio-inspired wing designs were discussed by Dwivedi et",

The proposed adaptive scheme is developed by applying concepts and theories of fractional calculus in weight adaptation structure of standard VLMS approach.

It is easily recurrent and has a high propensity for haematogenous spread especially to the lungs. We present the case of a 34-year-old Para 1 + 1 (1 alive) woman with recurrent vaginal mass of 8 years duration after two surgical excisions without histological evaluation. She had examination under anaesthesia and a wide local excision of the vaginal mass. Histological examination of the mass revealed poorly differentiated VLMS with positive surgical margins and she was commenced on adjuvant chemo-radiation. Histological evaluation remains the hallmark for diagnosing rare malignancies like VLMS, which unfortunately is not a standard practice in some resource-constraint settings.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nErroneous gesture execution is at the core of motor cognition difficulties in apraxia. While a taxonomy of errors may provide important information about the nature of the disorder, classifications are currently often inconsistent. This study aims to identify the error categories which distinguish apraxic from non-apraxic patients.\n\n\nMETHOD\nTwo groups of mixed (bucco-facial and limb) and bucco-facial apraxic patients suffering from stroke were compared to non-apraxic, left and right hemisphere damaged patients in tasks tapping the ability to perform limb and bucco-facial actions. The errors were analysed and classified into 6 categories relating to content, configuration or movement, spatial or temporal parameters and unrecognisable actions. Furthermore, an anatomical investigation (VLMS) was conducted in the whole group of left hemisphere damaged patients to investigate potential correlates of the various error categories.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAlthough all the above error typologies may be observed, the most indicative of mixed apraxia is the content-related one relate to content in all the typologies of actions (transitive and intransitive), and configuration errors in transitive ones. Configuration and content errors in mouth actions seem to be typical of bucco-facial apraxia. Spatial errors are similar in both apraxic and right brain damaged, non-apraxic patients. A lesion mapping analysis of left-brain damaged patients demonstrates that all but the spatial error category are associated with the fronto-parietal network. Moreover, content errors are also associated with fronto-insular lesions and movement errors with damage to the paracentral territory (precentral and postcentral gyri). Spatial errors are often associated to ventral frontal lesions.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBucco-facial and mixed apraxic patients make different types of errors in different types of actions. Not all errors are equally indicative of apraxia. In addition, the various error categories are associated with at least partially different neural correlates.",

        "abstract": "Currently, most two-dimensional (2D) materials that are of interest to emergent applications have focused on van der Waals–layered materials (VLMs) because of the ease with which the layers can be separated (e.g., graphene). Strong interlayer-bonding-layered materials (SLMs) in general have not been thoroughly explored, and one of the most critical present issues is the huge challenge of their preparation, although their physicochemical property transformation should be richer than VLMs and deserves greater attention. MAX phases are a classical kind of SLM. However, limited to the strong interlayer bonding, their corresponding 2D counterparts have never been obtained, nor has there been investigation of their fundamental properties in the 2D limitation. Here, the authors develop a controllable bottom-up synthesis strategy for obtaining 2D SLMs single crystal through the design of a molecular scaffold with Mo 2GaC, which is a typical kind of MAX phase, as an example. The superconducting transitions of Mo 2GaC at the 2D limit are clearly inherited from the bulk, which is consistent with Berezinskii–Kosterlitz–Thouless behavior. The authors believe that their molecular scaffold strategy will allow the fabrication of other high-quality 2D SLMs single crystals, which will further expand the family of 2D materials and promote their future application.",

        "abstract": "A 28-years-old healthy woman presented with a bluish swelling on the dorsum of tongue, which was present for almost two decades. Her parents noticed bluish discoloration of tongue when she was approximately 8 years old, which enlarged at puberty to a pea-sized swelling. The lesion increased progressively to the present size in the last 2–3 years. Examination revealed a bilobed swelling, 3 × 4 cm in size [Figure 1A], present over the dorsum of middle one-third of the left half of the tongue. The swelling was soft, partially compressible with no thrill or bruit. The patient was majorly asymptomatic with no pain or difficulty in mastication but gave a history of occasional bleeding while chewing hard food. Rest of the mucocutaneous examination and physical examination was normal. Her hematological investigations and blood biochemistry revealed no abnormality. High-resolution ultrasonography (USG) showed an anechoic lesion on the dorsum of the tongue on the left side. The superficial, irregular, anechoic, cystic component reached up to the tongue surface. Lesion had a vaguely echogenic deeper component, which showed mild vascularity on color Doppler imaging [Figure 2A]. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) of the face showed a non-enhancing, low attenuation mass of water density (Houndsfield Unit was 10-12 HU) with a deeper well-defined, irregular, homogenously enhancing component [Figure 2B] with enhancement persisting in the delayed phases as well. These findings were consistent with combined venolymphatic malformation (VLM) of tongue. The patient was treated by sclerotherapy using intralesional injections of 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate (STS). The lesion was injected with insulin syringe at multiple sites, using approximately 0.3–0.4 mL of solution. Postinjection, manual compression using gauze piece was given for 3 min. She reported transient pain and burning sensation immediately after the injection that resolved spontaneously in the next 15 min. No delayed adverse effects were noted. Two such injections at 3-week interval led to complete resolution of the lesion [Figure 1B] with no recurrence after 1 year.",

We aim to explore the fast rotation (in the time-scales of hours) in Very Low Mass stars (VLMs) including Brown Dwarfs (BDs). From a sample of 177 light-curves using our new I-band observations, we detect new photometric variability in 22 young M-dwarfs including 6 BDs, which are bonafide members in IC 348 and well-characterized in the spectral type of M-dwarfs. Out of 22 variables, 11 M dwarfs including one BD show hour-scale periodic variability in the period range 3.5 - 11 hours and rest are aperiodic in nature. Interestingly, an optical flare is detected in a young M2.75 dwarf in one night data on 20 December 2016. From the flare light curve, we estimate the emitted flared energy of 1.48 $\\times$ 10$^{35}$ ergs.

        "abstract": "Patients that retain CO2 in respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have worse prognoses and higher mortality rates than those with equal impairment of lung function without hypercapnia. We recently characterized the time‐dependent physiologic effects of chronic hypercapnia in goats, which suggested potential neuroplastic shifts in ventilatory control mechanisms. However, little is known about how chronic hypercapnia affects brainstem respiratory nuclei (BRN) that control multiple physiologic functions including breathing. Since many CNS neuroplastic mechanisms include changes in glutamate (AMPA (GluR) and NMDA (GluN)) receptor expression and/or phosphorylation state to modulate synaptic strength and network excitability, herein we tested the hypothesis that changes occur in glutamatergic signaling within BRN during chronically elevated inspired CO2 (InCO2)‐hypercapnia. Healthy goats were euthanized after either 24 h or 30 days of chronic exposure to 6% InCO2 or room air, and brainstems were rapidly extracted for western blot analyses to assess GluR and GluN receptor expression within BRN. Following 24‐hr exposure to 6% InCO2, GluR or GluN receptor expression were changed from control (P < 0.05) in the solitary complex (NTS & DMV),ventrolateral medulla (VLM), medullary raphe (MR), ventral respiratory column (VRC), hypoglossal motor nucleus (HMN), and retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). These neuroplastic changes were not found following 30 days of chronic hypercapnia. However, at 30 days of chronic hypercapnia, there was overall increased (P < 0.05) expression of glutamate receptors in the VRC and RTN. We conclude that time‐ and site‐specific glutamate receptor neuroplasticity may contribute to the concomitant physiologic changes that occur during chronic hypercapnia.",

We here present numerical simulations of the formation of VLMS, BDs, and planet mass objects (planemos) resulting from the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of solar mass molecular cores with varying rotation rates and initial density perturbations. Our simulations yield various types of binary systems including the combinations VLMS-VLMS, BD-BD, planemo-planemo, VLMS-BD, VLMS-planemos, BD-planemo. Our scheme successfully addresses the formation of wide VLMS and BD binaries with semi-major axis up to 441 AU and produces a spectrum of mass ratios closer to the observed mass ratio distribution (q > 0.5). Molecular cores with moderate values of the ratio of kinetic to gravitational potential energy (0.16 <= beta <= 0.21) produce planemos. Solar mass cores with rotational parameters beta outside of this range yield either VLMS/BDs or a combination of both. With regard to the mass ratios we find that for both types of binary systems the mass ratio distribution varies in the range 0.31 <= q <= 0.74. We note that in the presence of radiative feedback, the length scale of fragmentation would increase by approximately two orders of magnitude, implying that the formation of binaries may be efficient for wide orbits, while being suppressed for short-orbit systems.",

As the major improvements, the effectiveness of the compensation circuits under the ADC quantization noise effect is evaluated. The bit-error-rates (BER) in dynamic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios are calculated. We have proposed the use of variable step-size LMS (VLMS) to shorten the convergence time and to improve the compensation effect in general. To evaluate and compare different compensation methods, a complex Matlab model of the Ultra high frequency (UHF) DRF with 4-QPSK channels was implemented. The simulation results show that all compensation methods significantly improve the receiver performance, with the convergence time of the VLMS algorithm does not exceed 5.10 samples, the adjacent channel power ratios (ACPR) are reduced more than 30 dBc, and the BERs decrease by 2–3 orders of magnitude, compared with the noncompensated results. The simulation results also indicate that the subtraction method in general has better performance than the inversion method.",

        "abstract": "One of the challenging problems in computer vision is hand segmentation, especially when the hands overlap with the face. There are many applications that require this type of segmentation, such as sign language recognition, action recognition and recognition of objects that hands interact with. Hand over face is a challenging scenario where faces are occluded by hands, that can be used to test the performance of hand segmentation methods. Not much work has been done on this topic. After analysis of related datasets for hand segmentation that include hands in front of or near to the face, we introduce our challenging public dataset for the hand-over-face segmentation problem. The new dataset contains 4384 annotated frames and includes color, depth, infrared streams recorded by Kinect. Additionally, hand(s) locations and shapes data using Leap Motion sensor, which is an infrared hand shape sensor, are included. We compare two leading semantic segmentation methods: SegNet [1] and RefineNet [12], to analyze the new dataset. Two experiments were executed: the first one for hand-background segmentation and the other one for right hand- left hand- background segmentation. RefineNet shows significantly better accuracy, 14% better than that of SegNet, on our new dataset. Nonetheless, the highest accuracy archived was 62.2%, demonstrating that VLM-HandOverFace1 is a challenging dataset for the current state of the art.",

        "title": "Contamination of chickens by Salmonella spp., in Brazil: an important public health problem",
        "abstract": "Introduction: Bacteria of the genus Salmonella are important pathogens involved in the contamination of various foods, such as chickens, and may cause food poisoning. Aim: The present study aimed to review the literature on the prevalence of chickens contaminated with Salmonella spp., which are commercializated in different Brazilian states. Material and methods: This was a literary review. The absolute frequency and the total percentage of contaminated samples was calculated and the Qui-square statistical test was applied, considering statistically significant p <0.05. Results: 616 publications were retrieved, but only 10 articles were included to compose the results. The cataloged studies were carried out in 14 different brazilian states, and it was observed that of 5,030 chicken samples analyzed, the mean prevalence of samples contaminated with Salmonellawas 7,3% (n= 365). In addition, the prevalence of samples in the different studies ranged from 2.5% to 44.6%. The most prevalent serotype was S. Enteritidis (28,7%) and a statistically significant association between the type of raw material for commercialization and the result of the chicken samples microbiological analysis was observed (p<0.001), where the carcasses represented 90.1% of the contaminated samples. Conclusion: Thus, the data presented in this study can serve as subsidy for the development of necessary, political or legislative, measures that allow a better control of commercialized chickens in Brazil.Descriptors: Salmonella; Foodborne Diseases; Epidemiology.ReferencesSouza GC, Gonsalves HRO, Gonsalves HEO, Coelho JLS.

Cancer Biological Target. SMARCA Proteins Summary. Reversible protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of various cellular processes, including intracellular signaling and protein−protein interaction. Major causes of tumorigenesis and cancer malignancy are consequences of aberrant phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins in humans. Eukaryotic cells compact their DNA, the full genetic code for life in very small volume in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, complexing chromosomal DNA connects with core histone proteins to form chromatin, which allows the double-stranded DNA to be wrapped around an octameric core of histone proteins. Chromosomal DNA can pack tightly against one another and may impose a steric barrier that prevents transcription, replication, recombination, and DNA repair machineries from binding to the DNA. Accessibility to the DNA is facilitated by two classes of enzymes, ATP-dependent nucleosome remodelers and histone-modifying enzymes: the mammalian switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) complexes and polycomb repressor complex 2 (PRC2). The mammalian SWI/SNF complexes (also called BAF complex for Brg-/Brama-associated factor complex) regulate chromatin remodeling and are powered by two closely related ATPase subunits, SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 (BRAHMA or BRM). SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 (SWI/SNF related, matrixassociated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A, members 4 and 2, respectively) are coexpressed in most tissue types with the exception of embryonic stem cells in which SMARCA4 is the only ATPase expressed unit. SWI/SNF complexes utilize the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to achieve the coordinate mobilization of nucleosomes and the modulation of chromatin accessibility. Chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs) utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disrupt DNA−nucleosome contacts, also move nucleosomes along the DNA, and eject or exchange nucleosomes. SWI/SNF complexes are required for several aspects of development and more recently have been strongly implicated in human disease. Mutations in the genes encoding the canonical SWI/SNF subunits are observed in nearly 20% of all cancers, including lung, ovarian, uterine, gastric, cervical, and esophageal. SMARCA4 is frequently mutated in primary tumors, while SMARCA2 inactivation is infrequent in tumor development. SMARCA2 has been shown to be an essential gene in SMARCA4-related cancer cell lines. Thus, SMARCA2 may be targeted in SMARCA4-related or -deficient cancers. However, lack of specificity and the inability to target and modulate SMARCA2 remains an obstacle to the development of effective treatments. Consequently, small-molecules that target SMARCA2 and potentiate the VHL’s substrate specifically may help provide promising therapeutic agents. The present Patent Highlight describes bifunctional (proteolysis targeting chimeric, PROTAC) compounds which function to recruit endogenous proteins to an E3 ubiquitin ligase for degradation. The PROTAC compounds have a broad range of pharmacological activities, and an effective amount is used for the treatment or amelioration of disease conditions such as cancer, including SMARCA4-related or -deficient cancer. Furthermore, the PROTAC compounds comprise of an E3 ubiquitin ligase binding moiety (ligand for an E3 ubiquitin ligase or “ULM” group) and a moiety that binds a target protein (protein/polypeptide targeting ligand or “PTM” group) such as the target protein/polypeptide that is placed in close proximity to the ubiquitin ligase to effect degradation of that protein. The ubiquitination ligase modulator (ULM) can be Von Hippel− Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase (VHL) binding moiety (VLM).",

        "title": "A new look at some old shortleaf pine progeny tests: lessons for silvicultural opportunities through partnerships.",
        "abstract": "—Starting in the 1980s, 155 shortleaf pine progeny tests were established by the USDA Forest Service on national forests across the range the species. Originally intended to support the agency’s timber management program (post-clearcutting and subsequent reforestation with planting), these progeny tests were largely abandoned as the Forest Service’s forest management policies changed. Over the years, some of these shortleaf pine progeny tests were lost to natural disturbances or harvested, but many still remain as more-or-less intact outplantings. Recently, large-scale planting needs to support shortleaf pine restoration on public lands has reignited interest in these established progeny tests, spurring the Southern Region (with the assistance of the Southern Research Station) to take another look at them. Recently, the Southern Region’s Forest Management Unit and the Southern Research Station (SRS) have partnered to reevaluate some shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) progeny tests established in the 1980s and early 1990s in Arkansas and Oklahoma (Hossain et al., in press). Although not established as a research trial, the progeny tests that remain in good condition still retain useful information that can help managers address concerns with this declining species across its natural range. This may be particularly true if new DNA marker technology can shed further light on the genetic nature of these shortleaf pine families, or if sufficient numbers remain to make statistical comparisons of growth and yield performance. If successful, the partnership between the Southern Region and SRS may be expanded regionally to include more progeny tests on other national forests, with emphasis placed on the subregions (e.g., southern Appalachians, Piedmont) that have experienced the most dramatic declines in shortleaf abundance. To date, staff of the SRS and Ouachita and Ozark–St. Francis National Forests have investigated dozens of these progeny tests and have formally resampled 14 of these tests. Field sampling began in 2018 and will continue into at least the fall of 2019, with limited assessments conducted to date (for example, Hossain et al. 2020; Hossain et al., in press). From this analysis, we can make a few preliminary assessments on the potential of this effort for this paper. First, although many of these progeny tests were not logged or destroyed by natural disturbances, some had received enough damage from past harvests, fires, ice storms, beetles, and other forest health problems that we chose not to sample them because too few families remained sufficiently intact. For instance, many—if not most—of the pines in these progeny tests had been impacted by multiple glaze events that have struck Arkansas and 1 Project Leader and Research Forester (DCB) and ORISE Fellow (SMH), USDA Forest Service, Southern Research Station, P.O.

        "title": "DIFERENTIAL DIAGNOSES OF ANGIOKERATOMAS",
        "abstract": "Angiokeratomas (AK) are probably the vascular lesions that induce more confusion in the literature. The most accepted classification of AK was performed by Imperial and Helwig[1], and they divide these lesions into five classical types: Mibelli’s AK, Fordyce’s AK, corporis diffusum AK, circumscribed naeviforme AK and solitary or multiple adquired angiokeratomas. Nevertheless, in the clinical practice, is not unusual to see AK type lesions associated to different types of vascular anomalies, and these lesions have difficult handling. In ISSVA classification AKs have been included as vascular anomalies provisionally unclassified. We perform the differential diagnoses of AKs and according to clinical picture, histopathological aspect, immunohistochemical markers and radiological findings proposed to divide AKs mainly in two groups. Primary AKs are the classical types. The new inmunohistochemical findings suggest that these lesions might be included as mixed capillary-lymphatic malformations. Secondary AKs are related with different vascular anomalies, secondary to other process with lymphatic obstruction, related to drugs, or associated with no vascular lesions as lymphoid lesions. Different underlying vascular anomelies might be related with AKs including deep capillary-lymphatic malformations (CLM), venous-lymphatic malformations (VLM), capillary-lymphatic-venous malformations (CLVM) (Klippel-Trenaunauy Sd), deep lymphatic malformations (LM), venous malformations (VM) as hyperkeratotic venous malformation, cavenomatous cerebral malformations, traumatic arteriovenous fistula and eccrine angiokeratomatous hamartoma. Clinical aspect, radiological studies and histopathological examination might help to do a correct diagnosis of this heterogenous entity.

If the TG and SAT series were not deseasoned and the seasonal variation is prominent in the series, then there is the risk that the three metrics are telling us almost the same thing, that is, the impact of the amplitude and phase differences between the seasonal signals in both series. The correlation and the RMS of the differences may be more representative from deseasoned series, as done in past studies. In addition the authors fit the seasonal variation together with the linear trend in the SAT-TG series, i.e., the residual seasonal variation may play a minor role in the estimated VLM and its uncertainty.

        "title": "Advances in Document Layout Analysis",
        "abstract": "Handwritten Text Segmentation (HTS) is a task within the Document Layout Analysis field that aims to detect and extract the different page regions of interest found in handwritten documents. HTS remains an active topic, that has gained importance with the years, due to the increasing demand to provide textual access to the myriads of handwritten document collections held by archives and libraries. This thesis considers HTS as a task that must be tackled in two specialized phases: detection and extraction. We see the detection phase fundamentally as a recognition problem that yields the vertical positions of each region of interest as a by-product. The extraction phase consists in calculating the best contour coordinates of the region using the position information provided by the detection phase. Our proposed detection approach allows us to attack both higher level regions: paragraphs, diagrams, etc., and lower level regions like text lines. In the case of text line detection we model the problem to ensure that the system's yielded vertical position approximates the fictitious line that connects the lower part of the grapheme bodies in a text line, commonly known as the baseline. One of the main contributions of this thesis, is that the proposed modelling approach allows us to include prior information regarding the layout of the documents being processed. This is performed via a Vertical Layout Model (VLM). We develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based framework to tackle both region detection and classification as an integrated task and study the performance and ease of use of the proposed approach in many corpora. We review the modelling simplicity of our approach to process regions at different levels of information: text lines, paragraphs, titles, etc. We study the impact of adding deterministic and/or probabilistic prior information and restrictions via the VLM that our approach provides. Having a separate phase that accurately yields the detection position (base- lines in the case of text lines) of each region greatly simplifies the problem that must be tackled during the extraction phase. In this thesis we propose to use a distance map that takes into consideration the grey-scale information in the image. This allows us to yield extraction frontiers which are equidistant to the adjacent text regions. We study how our approach escalates its accuracy proportionally to the quality of the provided detection vertical position. Our extraction approach gives near perfect results when human reviewed baselines are provided.",

        "abstract": "This is a space era for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with complex autonomous systems to have an objective research on interplanetary studies. The UAV design for the space application is a complicated approach due to its involvement with initial conditions such as the atmospheric data of that particular planet and in later stages, where the experimental testing setup requires a separate infrastructure to match that atmospheric conditions. So, where the planetary data required for design are density, temperature, viscosity, pressure and gravity. These are initial conditions which affects the design and performance parameters in the conceptual stage of the planetary UAV. This paper describes the UAV conceptual design methodology for the Mars application which includes the configuration selection, sizing, aerodynamic analysis and performance evaluation using low fidelity tools such as XFLR5 and OCTAVE (Low order code). The design performance is compared with Earth atmosphere and Martian atmosphere to estimate the impact created by the initial conditions. However, the performance validation for the design on Earth atmosphere is justified in correlation with XFLR5 and wind tunnel data of Sky walker X8. But the design on Mars atmosphere is correlated with the literature available from recent research studies and observed to be fair, which would an acceptable correlation during the conceptual stage.

        "abstract": ". Industry 4.0 is an ever-expanding set of complementary smart technologies and at the same time a system of social interactions of people through technologies. The bottleneck of Industry 4.0 is a discrepancy of, on the one hand, informal dealing with knowledge performed by people meaningfully by means of natural language. On the other hand, the representations and operations of knowledge those being assumed and executed by computer without reference to human's reasoning. As a promising way to overcome this inconsistency, the article analyzes possibility of smart technologies development based on the concept of dual knowledge of Polanyi. There has been done an analysis of researches which touch the concept of dual knowledge and which propose methods to apply the concept in practice. The paper emphasizes the importance of taking into account the features of the use of natural language as a pragmatic way of expressing tacit knowledge by actors of smart technologies. To assist actors expressing their latent ideas the paper proposes a visual linking mechanism (VLM) for natural language utterances. VLM allows creating a technology that assists a person in a “spiral” process of expressing tacit knowledge and coordinates his own outcomes with the views of other people. The article explains the functioning of the VLM by the example of the expression of ordinary human knowledge and reports VLM instrumental features.",

        "abstract": "Whether BDs form as stars through gravitational collapse (\"star-like\") or BDs and some very low-mass stars constitute a separate population which form alongside stars comparable to the population of planets, e.g. through circumstellar disk (\"peripheral\") fragmentation, is one of the key questions of the star-formation problem. For young stars in Taurus-Auriga the binary fraction is large with little dependence on primary mass above ~0.2Msun, while for BDs it is <10%. We investigate a case in which BDs in Taurus formed dominantly through peripheral fragmentation. The decline of the binary frequency in the transition region between star-like and peripheral formation is modelled. A dynamical population synthesis model is employed in which stellar binary formation is universal. Peripheral objects form separately in circumstellar disks with a distinctive initial mass function (IMF), own orbital parameter distributions for binaries and a low binary fraction. A small amount of dynamical processing of the stellar component is accounted for as appropriate for the low-density Taurus-Auriga embedded clusters. The binary fraction declines strongly between the mass-limits for star-like and peripheral formation. The location of characteristic features and the steepness depend on these mass-limits. Such a trend might be unique to low density regions hosting dynamically unprocessed binary populations. The existence of a strong decline in the binary fraction -- primary mass diagram will become verifiable in future surveys on BD and VLMS binarity in the Taurus-Auriga star forming region. It is a test of the (non-)continuity of star formation along the mass-scale, the separateness of the stellar and BD populations and the dominant formation channel for BDs and BD binaries in regions of low stellar density hosting dynamically unprocessed populations.",

Vancomycin hydrochloride microparticles were prepared with the help of double emulsion method. HPMC and Polaxomer 407 has been taken as the main polymers for the preparation of the microparticles. Chitosan was taken as the major polymer for the preparation of scaffolds for its greater biocompatibility and biodegradability. The preparation was done with the help of the solvent casting method. The formulation was taken for further characterization and evaluation studies. Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Differential scanning calorimetry were carried out for the pure vancomycin drug, and the chitosan polymer X-ray diffraction was carried out to check the crystallinity of the prepared scaffolds. The particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index for vancomycin loaded microparticles were found to be 577.0±102.5 nm, 1624 mv and 0.254. The maximum and sustained release rate of the drug was found to be 95.6±0.478, at 16th Hr. By taking all the reports, a conclusion can be drawn that, the formulated VLM biodegradable scaffolds will show burst release at the initial time of administration, which is essential for the wound healing activity and will be sustained throughout the process of treatment of osteomyelitis.",

Two different propellants have been considered, namely water vapor and nitrogen, which relate to their use in VLMs (the former) and cold gas microthrusters (the latter), respectively. Furthermore, two different numerical approaches have been used due to the different gas rarefaction regime, i.e. the typical continuum Navier–Stokes with partial slip assumption at walls and the particle–based Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique. As a result, under high–pressure operating conditions, both water and nitrogen flows supersonically expanded into the micronozzle without chocking in combination with a linear growth of the boundary layer on walls. However, when low–pressure operating condition are imposed and a molecular regime is established inside the micronozzle, a very rapid expansion occurred close to the nozzle exit in combination with a strong chocking of the flow and a micronozzle quality reduction of about 40%. Furthermore, water exhibited specific higher specific impulse than nitrogen above 60%.",

        "abstract": "Global climate changes are a main factor of risk for infrastructures and people living along the coasts around the world. In this context, sea level rise, coastal retreat and storm surges pose serious threats to coastal zones. In order to assess the expected coastal changes for the next decades, a detailed knowledge of the site’s topography (coastline position, DTM, bathymetry) is needed. This paper focuses on the use of very high resolution satellite data and UAV imagery for the generation of accurate very-high and ultra-high mapping of coastal areas. In addition, the use of very high resolution multi-spectral satellite data is investigated for the generation of coastal bathymetry maps. The paper presents a study for the island of Lipari and the coasts of Cinque Terre (Italy) and the island of Lefkas (Greece). For Lefkas, two areas of the island were mapped (the city of Lefkas and its adjoining lagoon in the north side of the island, and the Bay of Vasiliki at the south part of the island) using World View 1, and Wolrd View 3 satellite images, and UAV imagery. The satellite processing provided results that demonstrated an accuracy of approximately 0.25 m plannimetrically and 0.70 m vertically. The processing of the UAV imagery resulted in the generation of DTMs and orthophotos with an accuracy of approximately 0.03-0.04 meters. In addition, for the Vasiliki bay in the south of the island the World View 3 imagery was used for the estimation of a bathymetry map of the bay. The achieved results yielded an accuracy of 0.4 m. For the sites of Lipari and Cinque Terre (both in Italy), UAV surveys allowed to extract a DTM at about 2 cm of pixel resolution. The integration of topographic data with high resolution multibeam bathymetry and expected sea level rise from IPCC AR5 2.6 and 8.5 climatic scenarios, will be used to map sea level rise scenarios for 2050 and 2100, taking into account the Vertical Land Motion (VLM) as estimated from CGPS data. The above-mentioned study was realized during the implementation of the SAVEMEDCOASTS project (Sea level rise scenarios along the Mediterranean coasts, funded by the European Commission ECHO A.5, GA ECHO/SUB/2016/742473/PREV16, www.savemedcoasts.eu).",

Today’s TEMs allow us to study these processes with atomic resolution; we can actually determine locations with sub-Å lateral resolution. These advances are aided by new cameras that allow us to record processes in milliseconds (or innovative ‘illumination’ systems that allow us to record changes that may occur in nanoseconds—the DTEM). In an ETEM, or using an ‘environmental’ holder in a CTEM of STEM, we can now modify and control the environment around the specimen so that it is not necessarily UHV but could be an oxidizing gas or even a liquid [2]. Not only has resolution improved due to the achievement of Cs correction but CEOS and Nion have joined JEOL and the late FEI with acronyms for company names!

        "title": "Study on Propulsion Performance according to Variation of Rake Distribution at Propeller Tip",
        "abstract": "Interest in fossil energy depletion and global warming has increased in recent years. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been gradually applying indicators related to energy efficiency for newly constructed ships from 2013. In particular, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) represents the amount of carbon dioxide emissions generated during the transportation of 1tonne of cargo per mile, and it should be reduced by 30% by 2025, beginning with a 10% reduction in January 2013. As a result, research is continued to improve hull form and propulsion systems to reduce EEDI worldwide. For the propulsion system, research has been conducted for a long time to improve the propulsion performance by establishing a compound propulsion system. The compound propulsion system can be classified as pre device, main device, and post device. (Carton, 2015) Preswirl stator and Mewis duct, etc. are known to be somewhat more effective in pre device, and highperformance special propeller, contra rotating propeller and duct propeller are known to be effective as main device. Although the performance varies depending on the ship types, the approximate energy reduction effect is known to be about 3 to 4%. In addition, twisted rudder, rudder bulb and fin are known to be effective as post device. The performance of rudder has been improved by modifying the shape of the rudder or by installing an additive such as a fin or bulb. This study deals with the Kappel Propeller (Forward type) and Tip Rake Propeller (Backward type) which are known as newly developed propeller concept. In the Kappel propeller the tip is located on the suction side of the propeller, the transition between the blade and the tip is smooth, the tip is hydro-dynamically loaded and it is designed so as to contribute to the generation of lift and thrust. It should be noted that in the CLT propeller, contrary to Kappel propellers, the end plates are unloaded and operate as barriers, avoiding the communication of water between the pressure and the suction side of the blades, allowing to establish finite load at the tip of the blade. (G. Gennaro, et al., 2012) Both propellers are from Tip Fin Propeller concept that originally came from winglet which is widely used in aircraft. Winglets reduce the induced drag by weakening the vortex at the wing accordingly lead to a higher efficiency (Ha, et al., 2014). In other words, the two propellers have the principle of preventing the three-dimensional effect of vortex by reducing the fluctuating pressure changes at the wing tips. However, the comparison of the performance and the design techniques of the above two types propellers is less known (Yamasaki, et al., 2013). The parametric study for the optimum rake shape has been conducted in the present study. The performance of the finally optimized propellers was verified by CFD and model tests. Figure 1 Kappel Propeller (Left), CLT Propeller (Right) THE DESIGN OF TIP RAKE PROPELLER BASED ON POTENTIAL ANALYSIS KP505 which has been designed for KRISO container ship was selected as the reference propeller. This propeller is widely used for academic and comparative purposes as its performance and geometry are opened called as KCS. This propeller might be proper for the present comparative study because no radial rake was applied. Rake was applied to the reference propeller by adopting the parameters as the starting radii, the maximum rake size, and the rake application type (backward and forward). The starting points of rake distribution were selected as 0.4R, 0.5R and 0.6R and along to the blade tip. If the starting point is earlier than 0.4R or after 0.7R, it is very difficult to induce the rake effect actually. The maximum rake variation is from 1% to 10% of the propeller diameter. If it is larger than 10%, the profile of the propeller has excessive curvature and very difficult to be continuous along radii. Figure 2 represents the radial distribution of the rake applied to the propeller design of the forward type and backward type respectively. The rake shape along radii was designed as a sine curve. Figure 2 Rake distributions depending on radius Numerical analysis of the propeller open water performance is performed using KPA4 that is a potentialbased propeller analysis program. Potential-based numerical analysis has been used commonly in the study of the open water performance of the propeller (Kim, et al., 1993; Kim & Lee, 2005). The KPA4 has been developed based on the VLM (Vortex Lattice Method). The diameter of the model propeller for POW analysis is 250mm and the propeller rotation speed is 16rps. The analysis was performed with J=0.05 to J=1.00 at an interval of 0.05. The computed POW efficiency of the propellers were compared at designed KT/J 2 =0.4725 as shown in Figure 3. Based on these results, the optimal shape was selected for the two types of forward and backward propellers. The optimal was selected for the backward type which is the case of STP=0.4R and xG/D=0.02 was higher than the reference propeller as 2.15% and for the forward type, STP=0.5R and xG/D=0.03 is 3.35% higher. After the decided optimum rake has been applied to the propeller there was some non-smooth surface in the 3-D modeling. The discontinuity was observed as shown in Figure 4. Therefore the rake distribution was smoothly modified as shown in Figure 5. After the finally faired rake was applied the improvement of 1.9% by forward and 2.2% by backward was obtained respectively compared to the reference propeller which is shown in Table 3.",

        "abstract": "Demand and development in the space industry are conditioning more costeffective satellites without a reduction in functionality. One of the means of satisfying thus requirements is miniaturization. Constructing, smarter, lighter and cheaper satellites to reduce the cost of delivering it to the orbit as the main chunk of mission cost falls on delivering the satellite to space. Lighter versions of satellites called nano-satellites (CubeSats) which could be fabricated in mass scale in a reproducible manner might be a suitable solution. In simple words nanosatellite is a state of the art device packed with advanced logic electronics, sensor and actuator arrays as well as power management systems, etc. to perform numerous tasks. Considering the already high cost for large scale integration of various components it is very important to extend the lifetime of the devices as much as possible. Beside radiation which is one of the main reason for the failure of the components, satellites are useful only if they remain in the orbit and not deviate from the specific path it was set due to drag. Therefore the propulsion system is required to control the altitude to increase the operational lifetime of the satellite. The project is a continuation of the work in realizing a new generation of noble green Vaporizing Liquid Micro Thruster (VLM) functioning in environmentally friendly propellant(water) fabricated in Else Kooi Laboratory (EKL) with the cooperation of Aerospace Engineering (AE) faculty with an intention of contributing to the DELFFI mission. Thesis includes fabrication and testing of a thruster with a heavy emphasis on improving the performance of the heating chamber. Fabrication was accomplished by designing modules separately and assembling them through part by part exposure in the lithography. Such an approach was taken due to the need for systematic analysis of numerous factors affecting performance by altering them and observe the effect on performance. Several heating chambers were designed with varying performance attributes and tested on its ability to deliver heat efficiently as well as affect to thruster performance like pressure drop. In addition to it, several fabrication techniques not used previously for the fabrication of thrusters were experimented and implemented on making various channel structures giving freedom of more 3D design. As a result novel type of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) VLM heating chambers were fabricated by modular design and tested. Developed process is robust and flexible which allows to manufacture different types of VLM thrusters depending on operation demand and suited for integration. The novelty introduced in the project is step-wise heating as well as the application of a new type of localized heating chamber with improved geometry for enhanced heating efficiency and for wall temperature measurements.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing shift in the world towards sustainability. For civil aviation, this is reflected in the goals of several organizations including NASA and ACARE as significantly increased fuel efficiency along with reduced harmful emissions in the atmosphere. Achieving the goals necessitates the advent of novel and radical aircraft technologies, NASA’s X-57, is one such concept using distributed electric propulsion (DEP) technology. Although practical implementation of DEP is achievable due to the scale invariance of highly efficient electric motors, the current battery technology restricts its adoption for commercial transport aircraft. A Hybrid Electric Distributed Propulsion (HEDiP) system offers a promising alternative to the all-electric system. It leverages the benefits of DEP when coupled with a hybrid electric system. One of the areas needing improvement in HEDiP aircraft design is the fast and accurate estimation of wing aerodynamic characteristics in the presence of multiple propellers. A VLM based estimation technique was developed to address this requirement. This research is primarily motivated by the need to have mature conceptual design methods for HEDiP aircraft. Therefore, the overall research objective is to develop an effective conceptual design capability based on a proven multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) framework, and to demonstrate the resulting capability by applying it to the conceptual design of a regional transport aircraft (RTA) with HEDiP systems. Design Optimization of a Regional Transport Aircraft with Hybrid Electric Distributed Propulsion Systems Rajkumar Vishnu Ganesh GENERAL AUDIENCE ABSTRACT Recent years have seen a growing movement to steer the world towards sustainability. For civil aviation, this is reflected in the goals of key organizations, such as NASA and ACARE, to significantly improve fuel efficiency, reduce harmful emissions, and decrease direct heat release in the atmosphere. Achieving such goals requires novel technologies along with radical aircraft concepts driven by efficiency maximization as well as using energy sources other than fossil fuel. NASA’s all-electric X-57 is one such concept using the Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP) technology with multiple electric motors and propellers placed on the wing. However, today’s all-electric aircraft suffer from the heavy weight penalty associated with batteries to power electric motors. In the near term, a Hybrid Electric Distributed Propulsion (HEDiP) system offers a promising alternative. HEDiP combines distributed propulsion (DiP) technology powered by a mix of two energy sources, battery and fossil fuel. The overall goal of the present study is to investigate potential benefits of HEDiP systems for the design of optimal regional transport aircraft (RTA). To perform this study, the aerodynamics module of the Pacelab Aircraft Preliminary Design (APD) software system was modified to account for changes in wing aerodynamics due to the interaction with multiple propellers. This required the development of the Wing Aerodynamic Simulation with Propeller Effects (WASPE) code. In addition, a Wing Propeller Configuration Optimization (WIPCO) code was developed to optimize the placement of propellers based on location, number, and direction of rotation. The updated APD was applied to develop the HERMiT 2E series of RTA. The results demonstrated the anticipated benefits of HEDiP technologies over conventional aircraft, and provided a better understanding of the sensitivity of RTA designs to battery technology and level of hybridization, i.e., power split between batteries and fossil fuels. The HERMiT 6E/I was then designed to quantify the benefits of HEDiP systems over a baseline Twin Otter aircraft. The results showed that a comparable performance could be obtained with more than 50% saving in mission energy costs for a small weight penalty. The HERMiT 6E/I also requires only about 38% of the mission fuel borne by the baseline. This means a correspondingly lower direct atmospheric heat release, reduction in carbon dioxide and NOx emissions along with reduced energy consumptions. This Thesis is dedicated to my wonderful family",

        "abstract": "Warehouse picking is one of the most time and cost consuming activities in a warehouse, often requiring the presence of human operators, who travel within the aisles to retrieve the items needed by the customers. Several studies demonstrate that the travelling activity can represent even the 50% of the total picking time, with a subsequent creation of a separate storage and picking area for small objects. In the last years, new solutions for order picking systems have been developed, especially for small items. One of these solutions requires Vertical Lift Modules (VLMs), storage columns with extractable trays. In this paper, the employ of dualbay VLMs, compared to a traditional bin-shelving warehouse, has been analysed from an economic point of view. Some mathematical formulations have been developed, to estimate the total annual cost and the respective convenience limits of both systems, according to their productivity.

        "abstract": "In this study, a practical aerodynamic tool, which can calculate and show non-linear aerodynamic characteristics of three-dimensional wing, is developed to observe flow phenomena at high angles of attack. In particular, considering the success of the developed mathematical model in predicting preand post-stall aerodynamic behavior, some additions have been made which may be important in wing design and analysis stages. In this way, it is possible to calculate and visualize data such as surface pressure and velocity distribution, flow separation points, lift distribution, as well as aerodynamic performance coefficients of a wing in milliseconds on personal computer. Specifically, the program provides information on the effectiveness of the control surfaces at high attack angles by determining the flow separation points of the various wing geometries. The developed program stands out as a quick and practical tool in the early design stages. Thanks to the visualizations, this program will be very advantageous for both engineering education and R&D projects. INTRODUCTION Visualization has great bene ts in understanding physical events. For this reason, in many scienti c elds, it has been preferred to visualize an event to be investigated in an experimental setting. The biggest challenge for the test environment is its di cult and expensive installation and operation. However, with the rapid development of computers since the 1960s, it has become easier to solve physical problems at various levels. Especially after the 1990s, with the development of personal computers and programming languages, it has become possible to solve the mathematical model of many problems in any environment, convert numerical results into graphics and similar visual tools, create visualizations and animations by using graphical interfaces of computers. In aerodynamics education, it can be di cult for the students to understand the relationship between two-dimensional and three-dimensional ow. In addition, in some design studies, the behavior and ow characteristics of the wing in high angles of attack, especially in the stall region, is a matter of curiosity. It is possible to calculate the performance coe cients and visualize the ow characteristics ∗Res.

However, these tools are not practical in terms of the computational power and time requirement [Cummings et al., 2015]. Low-order potential methods can partially meet these needs in the linear zone [Katz and Plotkin, 2001]. Programs such as XFLR5, Tornado VLM and OpenVSP, developed by various institutions or individuals, stand out as a fast, practical and inexpensive tool with the potential methods they use (Figure 1). However, these type programs can usually only perform linear region calculations. Y ukselen has developed various codes to simulate aerodynamics problems for use in aerodynamic education, and presented some of them in academic publishings [Yukselen, 2012, 2014 and 2015]. In an unpublished study, he developed also a simulation code applying lifting line method to visualize the pressure distribution on a wing and its variation with geometry and angle of attack. But this code is, again, works at low and moderate angles of attack.",

        "title": "Ablation of PHOX2B‐Derived Astrocytes Results in Neuronal Dystrophy‐Like Neuropathology in the RTN",
        "abstract": "The transcription factor Phox2b is a regulator of the autonomic nervous system development and is especially expressed by respiratory circuits involved in chemosensory integration, as neurons of solitary tract nucleus (NTS) that relay information from peripheral chemoreceptors to the ventral respiratory column, and by central chemoreceptors located in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). In addition to neurons, recent studies show that astrocytes from ventral medullary surface also detect PCO2 increase, and contribute to respiratory drive. Since PHOX2B biased progenitor cells generate astrocytes that have a developmental connection with RTN neurons, the aim of this study is determine the extent to which selective ablation of these astrocytes affect synapse integrity in the retrotrapezoid nucleus. We utilized the astrocyte ablation technique described by Tsai et al., 2012. In this model, the astrocyte‐specific ALDH1L1 promoter induces GFP expression in the absence of cre recombinase, and in the presence of cre recombinase expresses diphtheria toxin A (DTA). We interbred ALDH1L1loxp‐GFP‐STOP‐loxp‐DTA mice to PHOX2Bcre mice. Transmission electron photomicrographs were captured from the RTN/VLM area and morphometric analysis was performed using FIJI. We noted that axon terminals in the mutants (PHOX2Bcre, ALDH1L1loxp‐GFP‐STOP‐loxp‐DTA) were on average larger in area and perimeter. Furthermore, we noted an increase in the percentage of axon terminals showing autophagic vacuoles/phagosomes. The proportion of axon terminals with other organelles, including mitochondria and dense core neurosecretory vesicles, was not different between groups. In summary, PHOX2B‐derived, astrocyte ablated mice show synaptic pathology characterized by dysmorphic neuroaxonal morphology, suggesting an underlying defect in the afferent input into the RTN. These data suggest that PHOX2B‐derived astrocytes may play a role in regulating the synaptic integrity of neuronal inputs into RTN neurons. Other experiments are being performed in order to elucidate if the cell body of these neurons is located in the commissural NTS, and also, if PHOX2b derived astrocytes depletion can imply local regulation of presynaptic autophagy, which can lead to neurodegeneration and breathing impair.",

The reason why this process is complex is not only that the works of the different disciplines affect each other, but also each work area has too many parameters that affect the air vehicle in itself. It is inevitable that a precise calculation of the effects of combinations of these parameters on the aircraft will bring this design process to an unbearable dimension in terms of cost and time. Therefore, there is a need for fast design tools that provide approximate results for use in the conceptual and preliminary design process of air vehicles. However, because of having too many parameters, having only fast design tools is not enough to make a successful and reliable design in a short time. Therefore, optimization programs are needed together with rapid analysis methods. Recently, the importance given to the defense industry and investments have increased in our country. Therefore, many air vehicle projects are being carried out. In the process of these air vehicle projects, knowledge of aircraft design is needed especially for the UAV. Therefore, the optimization and design analysis tools to be developed will contribute to the design processes of these air vehicles. In the conceptual and preliminary design stages of air vehicles, panel methods have been used widely due to their quick and acceptable approximate results. As the design process is multidisciplinary and depends on many parameters, optimization and different discipline analysis tools are needed in addition to the aerodynamic analysis programs to produce a successful aircraft design. In this context, several design optimization studies using panel methods are encountered in the literature. One of these studies is about the optimization of a single-element wing by using Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) with 2D viscous airfoil experimental data and an optimization technique including wing area, wingspan, taper ratio, leading edge sweep and geometric twist as optimization variables [Pinzon, 2008]. 2D data is taken from look-up tables according to the local lift coefficients of the wing sections obtained from VLM calculations. In another study, Hajec uses a non-linear lifting line method with 2D viscous airfoil solver XFOIL for single-wing aerodynamic analysis and an evolutionary optimization algorithm [Hajec 2009]. For the multielement lifting surface systems Demircan uses the Vortex Lattice Method for potential flow solutions and a genetic algorithm method for the optimization of wing-tail combinations [Demircan, 2018]. In this last study viscosity effects are ignored. The aim of this study is to develop a computer program which can optimize the wing-tail systems consisting of two or more lifting surface, to be used for various purposes, especially in unmanned aerial vehicle design works. METHOD In the present study, Vortex Ring Method (VRM) is applied for the solution of potential flow around lifting-surface systems (wing-tail combinations). However, in order to take into account also the viscosity effects, 2D experimental/numerical airfoil data is used. In addition, weight estimation and performance calculations were added to the program and statistical weight formulas were used for weight estimation. General performance formulas are used for performance calculations. These formulas are explained in the applications section. For the optimizations, one of the evolutionary algorithms, the genetic algorithm is preferred. Vortex Ring Method for Multi Element Lifting Surface Systems The Vortex Ring Method (VRM) used in this study is a version of Vortex Lattice Method (VLM). The details of its formulations for a single element wing can be found in several aerodynamics text books (see for example [Katz and Plotkin, 2001]). In the present paper a formulation of the method for multi-element lifting surfaces developed by Yükselen [Yükselen, 2015, 2017] is followed. AIAC-2019-149 Yildiz & Yukselen 3 Ankara International Aerospace Conference Both, in VLM and VRM the thickness effects of a wing are neglected and the wing is considered as a thin surface. This surface is divided into spanwise and chordwise panels as shown in Fig. 1. In VRM, vortex rings are placed on each panel and horse-shoe vortices at the trailing edge of the wing, while horse-shoe vortices placed on all of the panels in VLM. Figure 1: Vortex ring distribution and placement The front arm of the vortex ring is located on the quarter line of a panel, while the aft arm is located on the quarter line of the next panel in the direction of chord. The trailing arms of the vortex ring are located on the left and right sides of the panel. The trailing arms of the horseshoe vortices placed on the wing trailing edge go to infinity in the direction of free flow. The strengths of vortex rings are unknowns of the potential flow problem. In order to obtain vortex strengths, tangent flow boundary condition is applied at the control points on each panel, which results with a linear equation system. Control points are at the three quarter central point of each panel (centroid of vortex ring). With the application of the surface boundary condition at each control points of a multi-element lifting surface system the following equations system is obtained:",

        "abstract": "Miniaturization of spacecraft has been gaining wide interest in the space industry, given its potential for reducing space missions' costs and providing a novel approach to enhancing and facilitating spaceflight. Recently, a lot of research has been successfully put into this field along with the advancements that make it more feasible, though a major obstacle to achieving the new generation of spacecraft is the technical challenge of fitting a suitable propulsion system. Useful chemical propellants are usually corrosive, flammable, and/or toxic, so alternatives need to be found. The aerospace industry is shifting towards green and nontoxic propulsion systems, so water could be used as an effective propellant, considering its relatively high mass density and low molecular mass. New microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies show promising opportunities for the integration of miniaturized propulsion systems, due to their versatility and robustness. In this thesis, a comparative study of nozzle flow, heat transfer, and thermodynamics in two different thrusters is conducted. One thruster is based on MEMS, with a typically quasi-2D geometry, while the second thruster is based on more conventional technologies and manufacturing techniques, with an axially symmetrical 3D shape. After briefly introducing micropropulsion and discussing the propellant selection and nozzle fabrication along with the background theory related to micropropulsion as well as the analytical and OpenFOAM numerical (DSMC, continuum, and a hybrid approach containing both to accommodate to the variation in Knudsen number throughout the computational domain) modeling methods, the used methodology is based on using OpenFOAM's DSMC solver (dsmcFoam+) following the mesh creation using blockMesh and snappyHexMesh and developed analytical model (using MATLAB and CoolProp) along with an additional VLM ANSYS Fluent CFD model prepared in advance at TU Delft, where their (steady state as well as transient for DSMC) results (including the same conventional and MEMS nozzles) are processed and discussed. The nozzles are simulated for inlet pressures of 5 and 7 bar at inlet temperatures of 550 and 773 K for a total of four cases for each nozzle. To note, many of dsmcFoam+'s functionalities (mass flow rate measurements, inlet pressure boundary condition, axisymmetric capabilities, statistical error measurements, and dynamic load balancing) are implemented and described along with the full methodology, as Blender (with add-ons) and ParaView with a Python script to extract averaged data (along the nozzle and plume region) along with sampleDict are also used in pre and post-processing respectively and the simulations are carried out on a computer cluster. Furthermore, a quite interesting theoretical project on the side has been independently worked on in parallel. It started as a noticed idea that was decided to be explored using equations, which led to extended continuum/kinetic dimensionless numbers for diffusivity and rarefaction intensity relative to the studied object’s timescale. Ultimately, there are tradeoffs to choosing either thruster, where it is impractical to fault one nozzle for not performing better than the other, as it comes back to the desired features and nature of the mission each is undertaking, where compromises have to be made.",

        "abstract": "Patients that retain CO2 with respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have worse prognoses and higher mortality rates than those with equal impairment of lung function without hypercapnia. However, little is known about the effects of chronic hypercapnia on the neurochemical mechanisms controlling brainstem respiratory nuclei (BRN). Common mechanisms of neuroplasticity involve changes in glutamate receptor expression/phosphorylation to modulate synaptic strength and network excitability, driven by changes in both AMPA (GluR) and NMDA (GluN) glutamate receptors. Accordingly, herein we tested the hypothesis that changes occur in glutamatergic signaling within the BRN during exposure to chronically elevated inspired CO2 (InCO2) induced hypercapnia. Healthy goats were euthanized after either 24 hours or 30 days of chronic exposure to 6% InCO2 or room air. The brainstems were extracted for western blot analyses to assess GluR and GluN receptor expression and phosphorylation state within the BRN. Compared to room air control goats, the following significant (P<0.05) changes were found after 24 hours of exposure to chronic hypercapnia: 1) AMPA receptor expression was greater, and NMDA receptor expression lower within the rostral solitary complex. 2) NMDA receptor expression/phosphorylation and APMA receptor phosphorylation were lower within the rostral ventrolateral medulla (VLM), while AMPA receptor expression/phosphorylation were greater in the caudal VLM. 3) AMPA receptor expression/phosphorylation were lower within the rostral retrotrapezoid nucleus. And, 4) NMDA receptor expression was greater within the caudal Raphe nucleus. The data indicate that within 24 hours of chronic hypercapnia changes have occurred in four BRN in GluR/GluN signaling which may contribute to an attenuated CO2‐induced hyperpnea and attenuated CO2 chemoreflex between 1 and 24 hours of hypercapnia (J. Physiol. 2018). GluR/GluN changes found at 24 hours of hypercapnia had returned to control levels after 30 days of hypercapnia. However, compared to room air control goats, the following significant (P<0.05) changes were found following 30 days of hypercapnia: 1) NMDA receptor phosphorylation was greater in the caudal ventral respiratory column, and 2) AMPA receptor expression was greater in the caudal RTN. The changes in GluR/GluN signaling between 24 hours and 30 days of chronic InCO2 may contribute to a sustained hyperpnea and normalization of the CO2 chemoreflex at 30 days.",

        "title": "VAPORIZING LIQUID MICROTHRUSTER TESTING UNDER PULSED MODE OPERATION",
        "abstract": "Microthrusters are special category of propulsion device used to propel micro sized satellites. It is designed as per the mission requirements. There are various kinds of propulsion requirements such as continuous mode operation for orbit transfer (from one planet to another), orbit shift or adjustment for asteroid mining, pulsed mode operation for attitude control of satellites, and gravitation or solar drag compensation in orbit. Continuous mode operation is a high propellant consuming operation and designed cautiously to reach the destination with onboard available propellant. While pulsed mode operation is widely used for LEO (Low earth orbit) applications, where gravitation drag, atmospheric drag and solar drags are dominating. This paper focuses on the pulsed mode operation of vaporization liquid microthruster in vacuum operating condition. The pulsed mode operation involves timely thrust generation for the fine tuning of the positioning of the microsatellites. The operational timing in this mode of operation ranges from milliseconds to a few seconds at maximum. The operating time is decided based on the adjustment requirement for the positioning of the microsatellites. Vaporizing liquid microthrusters use green propellant to produce thrust. Tests are conducted under vacuum condition to simulate the actual space conditions and corresponding results are plotted. Results has shown a maximum thrust value of 290 μN at 1 sec of valve operating time, 335 μN at 2 seconds, 413 μN at 3 seconds, 524 μN at 4 seconds and 590 μN at 5 seconds of valve operating time for 200°C of a constant VLM temperature respectively. The effect of the dibble volume has also been discussed for the vaporization liquid microthruster using di-ionized water as liquid propellant.",

        "title": "High fidelity aerodynamics models for blended wing body design",
        "abstract": "The Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration is seen by many as one of the possible future protagonists of Civil Aviation, both for its potential benefits in terms of Aerodynamics performances and fuel consumption and for the possibility of incorporating Aero-Propulsive integration technology. However, the design of such an innovative aircraft does not come without any difficulties, which are mainly related to its unconventional shape and the lack of knowledge. In the framework of the development of a preliminary design tool (FAST), this work aimed at creating a High Fidelity Aerodynamics Model of the ISAE-OENRA BWB geometry, whose main purpose was the validation of the Lower Fidelity tools which are implemented at early stage phases of BWB design. The development of such a method allowed also to verify important properties of the flow around the geometry like efficiency, compressibility and trim, and paved the way to a further study of the stability and the control of the BWB configuration. The limits of this approach are to be found in the characteristics of the method (Euler equations) and its incapacity to picture important effects like friction Drag and separation. The following step of the research will be the implementation of a RANS model of the geometry.

International Journal of Robotics and Automation Engineering, Issue 2018, Vol. 01 2 classical BWB geometry, draw conclusions on the choice of some standard design parameters and propose optimization strategies. The majority of these papers highlights the importance of reliability and cost efficiency in aerodynamics computations to fasten optimization routines and get accurate and consistent results. However, so far no systematic study capable of merging Drag and consumption minimization, trim and stability constraints, structure constraints and propulsion integration has been carried out [3]. FAST [5] is a software that has been developed by ONERA and ISAE-SUPAERO to perform preliminary design and optimization of the classical \"wing-tube\" configuration aircraft, and which is now being updated to be applied on Blended Wing Body unconventional configuration. The research behind the development of such a powerful tool needs the collaboration and the involvement of many disciplines, whose contribution may take different forms: results validation, models comparison and analysis, methodology study and information collection. In this context, the purpose of this work was to develop a High Fidelity Aerodynamics model of the Blended Wing Body geometry to test the methodology, collect information, verify Aerodynamics and Gas Dynamics properties and compare with results obtained with other methods. In particular, the philosophical approach which constitutes the basis of this work consists in validating Low Fidelity preliminary design methods (FAST, VLM) using a High Fidelity model. The project therefore aims at running Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations, structured on one of the main sets of equations derived from NavierStokes equations and which constitute the basis of the numerical methods in Aerodynamics: Euler equations. The method has been fully developed and simulation cases have been studied. Compressibility, stability and efficiency are just some of the topics that have been studied thanks to the results of these simulations. This paper contains a description of all the steps which contributed to shape the methodology: familiarization with ISAE-ONERA Blended Wing Body geometry, creation of the mesh, choice of the solver and of the setting of the simulation parameters, data collection and results analysis.",

        "title": "Coupling a Numerical Optimization Technique with a Panel Method or a Vortex Lattice Method to Design Cavitating Propellers in Non-Uniform Inflows",
        "abstract": "In this study, a nonlinear optimization method, which is coupled with either a panel method or a vortex lattice method, is used to design open propellers in uniform, circumferentially averaged or non-uniform inflow. A B-spline geometry with 4× 4 control points is used to ensure that the propeller blade is accurately defined with fewer parameters. The optimization objective is to maximize the efficiency of the propeller while satisfying the given propeller thrust, and different cavity area or pressure constraints are applied. The influence of those constraints are studied, and propeller geometries are designed in different cases. The optimal efficiency as a function of the thrust coefficients are compared with those from other references, and the optimal circulations from this method are compared with those predicted from the lifting line optimization theory. It is shown that this method satisfies the optimization objectives and can be used in the practice of designing cavitating propellers. Keyword: optimization; panel method; vortex lattice method; cavitating propeller design Introduction The preliminary design of marine propellers has been gradually developing in the past. Generally, the methods used can be categorized into two types [Kerwin and Hadler, 2010]. The first one involves using systematic series of propellers, whose open water characteristics are already known, either from experimental tests or from computational fluid dynamic simulations [Yeo et al., 2014]. A widely seen example is by using the Wageningen B-screw series [van Lammeren et al., 1969]. The second type of methods do not require and are not limited to the known propeller series, but are based on the optimal radial distribution of circulation. These methods need the circumferentially averaged inflow, and are more adapted to the nominal wake filed downstream of the ship hull. An alternative approach can be seen as an improvement of the second type of methods. Mishima and Kinnas [1997] developed a numerical optimization method which is coupled with a Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) to design the cavitating propellers in the non-uniform inflow. A major advantage of this method is that it considers the circumferential variance of the inflow, which is important in predicting the periodic pressure fluctuations and the vibrations on the ship hull caused by the propeller in unsteady non-axisymmetric inflows. This method uses a B-spline to represent the blade geometry, and the optimization objective and constraints (thrust, torque, cavitation area, etc.) are approximated via second-order Taylor expansions. This method allows a constrained amount of cavitation in the design and thus can be applied to design propellers working under a moderate or even high loading. A numerical code called CAVOPT-3D (3-Dimensional CAVitating propeller blade OPTimizaiton) was developed and later improved by Griffin and Kinnas [1998] to include the minimum pressure constraints and a one-variable quadratic skew optimization. In the Ocean Engineering Group of University of Texas at Austin, the prediction of flows around propellers has been studied intensively in the past decades. The two major codes are MPUF-3A, which uses the VLM, and PROPCAV (PROPeller CAVitation), which uses the Boundary Element Method (BEM, more commonly known as the panel method). Some major improvements in MPUF-3A include: the thickness loading coupling scheme by Kinnas [1992], the unsteady wake alignment scheme and the non-linear terms in pressure evaluation by He [2010], etc. In PROPCAV, Kinnas et al. [2007] coupled the panel method with a boundary layer solver XFOIL [Drela, 1989] and developed the viscous/inviscid interaction method; Tian and Kinnas [2012] introduced a pseudo-unsteady wake alignment scheme ∗Corresponding Author, Weikang Du: allendu1988@utexas.edu (full wake alignment scheme, or FWA) to improve the accuracy of the predicted propeller performances, especially at low advance ratios. In this paper, the nonlinear optimization method is coupled with the newest version of MPUF-3A and PROPCAV to design cavitating propellers. Different constraints will be applied, and various inflows, including uniform, circumferentially averaged and non-uniform inflow will be used. The efficiency and optimal circulation from the current method will be compared with those from other references [Kerwin and Hadler, 2010] or the lifting line optimization method [Menéndez Arán and Kinnas, 2014].",

        "title": "Lithic residue analysis at Star Carr",
        "abstract": "Ancient trace residues left on stone artefacts by people represent a source of potentially fruitful data about diet, technology, and behaviour, but their investigation is not problem-free. Rather, correct identification of degraded residues and determination of their natural or anthropogenic origin remains at the heart of current methodological development in lithic residue analysis. This thesis addresses these issues by examining: 1) 13 modern reference residues on flint flakes, 2) modern residues on 78 experimentally buried flint flakes at Star Carr and off-site, and 3) residue traces on 138 archaeological stone artefacts from Star Carr. The study of modern reference residues showed that only residue types bearing diagnostic structures can be confidently identified by visual analysis alone. The study of experimentally buried flakes showed that tree resin, softwood tissue, and red ochre preserved after both one month and 11 months burial periods and across three burial environments, and were the most likely candidates to be encountered archaeologically. When the archaeological material was examined using reflected visible light microscopy (VLM), hypotheses of residue origin based on visual observations were tested against chemical information collected from the residues. Importantly, the microscopic hypotheses of residue identity based on comparison with reference residues and published literature were, in nearly all cases, falsified by confocal Raman microspectroscopy (micro-Raman) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Key identifications were: iron (III) oxide, gypsum, quartz, pyrite, and organics. Some residue samples also contained compounds consistent with pine tree resin, but this finding is considered preliminary. These results from stone artefacts highlight the need in lithic residue analysis for: 1) more careful consideration of chemical processes in the burial environment, and 2) further incorporation of appropriate scientific techniques to verify microscopic residue identifications.",

        "abstract": "High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platforms are the aerial platforms capable of flying in the stratosphere for long periods of time. This master thesis presents aircraft system identification procedures geared towards such fixed wing platforms where aerodynamic forces and moments are parametrically modelled with so-called stability and control derivatives. The first part of the thesis addresses local System identification procedures intended for controller synthesis at low altitude flights whereas the second part of the thesis deals with a preliminary study on a new global system identification method. \nThe local system identification procedure is based on the two step method, which offers flexibility regarding the aerodynamic structure. Therefore, it is suitable for the development of a system identification tool chain for various fixed wing platforms. Various system identification experiments have been conducted to collect flight test data. The parameters for the estimation of aerodynamic forces and moments are then found through an optimization procedure. Such parameters have been validated using a validation set from flight test data and their applicability for controller synthesis has been demonstrated. \nGlobal system identification typically requires the collection of flight test data at multiple points in the flight envelope and often, is combined with extensive Computational \nFluid Dynamics (CFD) solutions as well as wind-tunnel experiments. Such an approach is time consuming and costly. This thesis presents a new method to overcome the limitations of the current methodology by applying a Parameter search on VLM-based (Vortex Lattice Method) dynamic simulations of aircraft System identification manoeuvres and correcting the estimated models with available flight test data. The current study shows improvements in fidelity with decrease in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by factor 0.2 and 0.5 for x-axis and z-axis forces in body frame respectively, while reducing the effort for obtaining a model with similar fidelity.",

        "title": "Glucoprivic sensitivity of hindbrain catecholamine neurons is astrocyte‐dependent",
        "abstract": "Hypoglycemia poses a threat to survival. Endocrine, metabolic, and behavioral counter‐regulatory responses (CRRs) act to correct blood glucose deficit. These responses require sensor, integrator, and effector elements to restore glucose homeostasis. Groups of hindbrain catecholamine (CA) neurons are essential for implementation of different CRRs which include activation of descending sympathetic pathways controlling epinephrine and glucagon release and ascending pathways controlling feeding behavior and glucocorticoids (3, 4). Hindbrain astrocytes respond to low glucose (1, 2, 5). Therefore, we postulated that CA neurons are activated by astrocytes during glucose deficit. To directly test the proposition that CA neuron responses to glucoprivic challenges are astrocyte dependent, we utilized male and female transgenic mice in which the calcium reporter construct (GCaMP5) was expressed selectively in tyrosine hydroxylase neurons (TH‐GCaMP5; TH+). We conducted live‐cell calcium imaging studies on tissue slices containing the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST) and the ventrolateral medulla (VLM); loci of glucoregulatory circuitry (4). Results show that hindbrain TH+ neurons are robustly activated by a glucoprivic challenge and that this response is dependent on functional astrocytes. Pretreatment of hindbrain slices with fluorocitrate (an astrocytic metabolic suppressor) abolished TH+ neuronal responses to glucoprivation, but not to glutamate stimulation. Pharmacologic results suggest that the astrocytic connection with TH+ neurons is purinergic via P2 receptors. Parallel imaging studies on hindbrain slices of NST from wild type C57BL/6J mice (astrocytes and neurons were prelabeled with a calcium reporter dye and an astrocytic vital dye) show that both cell types are activated by glucoprivation but astrocytes responded nearly a minute sooner than neurons. Pretreatment of these hindbrain slices with fluorocitrate eliminated both astrocytic and neuronal responses to glucoprivation; pretreatment with P2 antagonists only abolished neuronal responses to glucoprivation without interruption of astrocyte responses. These results support earlier work suggesting that the primary detection of glucoprivic signals by the hindbrain is mediated by astrocytes which utilize purinergic gliotransmission to activate critical effector neurons.",

The concurrent design of aircraft is an extremely interdisciplinary activity incorporating simultaneous consideration of complex, tightly coupled systems, functions and requirements. The design task is to achieve an optimal integration of all components into an efficient, robust and reliable aircraft with high performance that can be manufactured with low technical and financial risks, and has an affordable life-cycle cost. Design/methodology/approach – CEASIOM (www.ceasiom.com) is a framework that integrates discipline-specific tools like computer-aided design, mesh generation, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), stability and control analysis and structural analysis, all for the purpose of aircraft conceptual design. Findings – A new CEASIOM version is under development within EU Project AGILE (www.agile-project.eu), by adopting the CPACS XML dataformat for representation of all design data pertaining to the aircraft under development. Research limitations/implications – Results obtained from different methods have been compared and analyzed. Some differences have been observed; however, they are mainly due to the different physical modelizations that are used by each of these methods. Originality/value – This paper summarizes the current status of the development of the new CEASIOM software, in particular for the following modules: CPACS file visualizer and editor CPACSupdater (Matlab) Automatic unstructured (Euler) & hybrid (RANS) mesh generation by sumo Multi-fidelity CFD solvers: Digital Datcom (Empirical), Tornado (VLM), Edge-Euler & SU2-Euler, Edge-RANS & SU2-RANS Data fusion tool: aerodynamic coefficients fusion from variable fidelity CFD tools above to compile complete aero-table for flight analysis and simulation.",

        "title": "3 Soil-Transmitted Helminthic Zoonoses in Humans and Associated Risk Factors",
        "abstract": "The soil is an important route for transmission of numerous human pathogens, including the five major soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), also known as geohelminths, namely: roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), whipworm (Trichuris trichiura), hookworms (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus), and threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis (Brooker et al., 2006). An estimated one billion people are currently infected with STHs worldwide, particularly in resource-poor settings (WHO, 2011). Although overall mortality due to STH infections is low, morbidity may be significant given the pronounced impact on nutrition, growth, physical fitness, cognitive functions among infected infants, schoolchildren and adults from developing countries (Bethony et al., 2006). In Africa, an estimated 89.9 million children harbor STHs, many of whom are co-infected with two or more STH species (WHO, 2011). Zoonotic agents, comprising a wide variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites, account for almost two thirds of all known human infections. Some helminthoses that commonly infect canids and felids are typically soil-transmitted. This chapter focuses on two major groups of STHs that cause disease in humans: (a) the ascarids Toxocara canis and T. cati, associated with visceral and ocular larva migrans, and (b) the hookworms Ancylostoma braziliense and Anc. caninum, associated with cutaneous larva migrans. We review the current geographic distribution, laboratory diagnosis and clinical spectrum of these infections, examine the relative contribution of some risk factors for infection and disease, and discuss potential control measures for reducing the burden of disease in companion animals and humans. A third soil-transmitted ascarid species that can cause human disease is Baylisascaris procyonis, commonly found in raccoons in North America. Human infections are characterized by severe neurological disease, leading to death or long-lasting sequelae (Watts et al., 2006). Another nematode species, Gnathostoma spinigerum, has occasionally been found in biopsy sample from patients with suspected VLM. More recently species of Toxocara including T. malayensis, a parasite of the domestic cat, and T. lyncus, which infects the caracal, have been identified, but their role in human disease remains unknown (Despommier, 2003). Soil-transmitted larval infection with other common canine and feline hookworms, such as Anc. ceylanicum, Anc. tubaeforme and Uncinaria stenocephala, can also cause occasional dermatological lesions in humans, and Anc. ceylanicum can readily develop in adults causing severe enteritis (Bowman",

In this pioneer study we show the capability of the VVV project to measure high precision trigonometric parallaxes for very low mass stars (VLMS) up to distances of ∼400 pc reaching farther than most other ground based surveys or space missions for these types of stars. Two stars in our sample are low mass companions to sources in the TGAS catalog, the VVV astrometry of the fainter source is consistent within 1-σ with the astrometry for the primary source in TGAS catalog, confirming the excellent astrometric quality of the VVV data even nearby of saturated sources, as in these cases. Additionally, we used spectral energy distribution to search for evidence of unresolved binary systems and cool subdwarfs. We detected five systems that are most likely VLMS belonging to the Galactic halo based on their tangential velocities, and four objects within 60 pc that are likely members of the thick disk. A more comprehensive study of high proper motion sources and parallaxes of VLMS and brown dwarfs with the VVV is ongoing , including thousands of newly discovered objects (Kurtev et al. 2016).",

        "title": "TOXOCARIASIS, UNA ENFERMEDAD QUE AÚN MERECE NUESTRA ATENCIÓN:",
        "abstract": "Sr Editor.Dentro de las zoonosis parasitarias, que son de importancia en salud publica, se encuentra la Toxocariasis, esta es una enfermedad causada por estadios larvarios del nematodo de Toxocara canis y Toxocara cati que tiene como hospedero definitivo el intestino de perros y gatos (1), siendo otros de sus hospederos paratenicos el hombre, y algunos otros mamiferos (2). Esta enfermedad parasitaria se da en todo el mundo y a pesar de su alta prevalencia en los paises tropicales en desarrollo, la Toxocariasis se considera una enfermedad desatendida (3). La Toxocariasis humana se adquiere con la ingesta de huevos embrionados del parasito desde el suelo, larvas presentes en vegetales o en carne cruda de sus hospedadores (3,4). En el humano no se completa el ciclo vital del nematodo, despues de la ingesta, las larvas infecciosas eclosionan del huevo, el estadio inmaduro de la larva permanece en el humano por prolongados periodos de tiempo en el que se disemina causando danos en los diferentes tejidos que pueda localizarse (5). Esta zoonosis tiene muchas implicancias clinicas desde patologias oculares, viscerales, respiratorias y epidemiologicas (3,6), los metodos diagnosticos requieren de personal profesional entrenado (6). Clinicamente se pueden distinguir tres formas de presentacion de la enfermedad: el sindrome de Larva Migrans Visceral (SLMV), definido por un compromiso de organos como el higado, pulmon, piel, sistema nervioso, musculoesqueletico, rinon y corazon; el sindrome de Larva Migrans Ocular (OLM), caracterizado por una afeccion al ojo y a los nervios opticos y la Toxocariasis inaparente o encubierta, forma mas leve, que comprende un espectro clinico que va desde una infeccion casi asintomatica hasta la migracion de larvas a organos blanco especificos( 6,7). El SLMV es la manifestacion mas grave de Toxocariasis y se presenta particularmente en ninos menores de 5 anos (7). Es importante destacar que los articulos publicados sobre esta enfermedad en America Latina son limitados. En un estudio realizado en Lima – Peru se encontro 20,46% de seropositividad con alta proporcion en ninos de 1 a 10 anos (3). En otro estudio que se llevo a cabo al norte de Lima se encontro 31,1% (201/646) de los pacientes estudiados presentaron anticuerpos anti-toxocara(8). En una revision, se encontro que la seroprevalencia en America Latina oscila entre 1,8 y 66 % y varia en los paises, en Peru se aproxima el 32% de prevalencia, mientras que en Venezuela llega al 66% (9). La necesidad en el futuro de programas de control debe enfocarse en la biologia molecular de las proteinas que son usadas en inmunodiagnostico de VLM y OLM, asi como en el desarrollo de vacunas basadas en ADN que ofrezcan una proteccion de por vida. Anteriormente la identificacion de especies de Toxocara se determinaba por las caracteristicas morfologicas del parasito, sin embargo, actualmente se han desarrollado tecnicas moleculares mas precisas para el diagnostico, que implican el uso de ADN (10), pruebas serologicas para la deteccion de anticuerpos especificos mediante ensayos inmunoabsorbentes ligados a enzimas (ELISA) aumentando la sensibilidad y especificidad diagnostica, teniendo tambien menos reacciones cruzadas, asi como proteinas recombinantes para medir anticuerpos recombinantes especificos de Toxocara(2,11). El control adecuado de esta zoonosis parasitaria constituiria una gran disminucion de riesgos a la salud publica en paises en desarrollo, mayormente en el riesgo de infeccion en ninos menores de 10 anos que son mas susceptibles al contagio, y mas susceptibles a adquirir formas mas patogenas de Toxocariasis. Es necesario impulsar la colaboracion entre investigadores relacionada a la Toxocariasis, para lograr una investigacion superior a nivel mundial y sobre todo en los paises en desarrollo donde tiene mayor importancia por su alta incidencia, ademas tambien desde el punto de vista epidemiologico, clinico, la ecologico, molecular y tratamiento asociado con la Toxocariasis.",

        "abstract": "Sr Editor.Dentro de las zoonosis parasitarias, que son de importancia en salud publica, se encuentra la Toxocariasis, esta es una enfermedad causada por estadios larvarios del nematodo de Toxocara canis y Toxocara cati que tiene como hospedero definitivo el intestino de perros y gatos (1), siendo otros de sus hospederos paratenicos el hombre, y algunos otros mamiferos (2). Esta enfermedad parasitaria se da en todo el mundo y a pesar de su alta prevalencia en los paises tropicales en desarrollo, la Toxocariasis se considera una enfermedad desatendida (3). La Toxocariasis humana se adquiere con la ingesta de huevos embrionados del parasito desde el suelo, larvas presentes en vegetales o en carne cruda de sus hospedadores (3,4). En el humano no se completa el ciclo vital del nematodo, despues de la ingesta, las larvas infecciosas eclosionan del huevo, el estadio inmaduro de la larva permanece en el humano por prolongados periodos de tiempo en el que se disemina causando danos en los diferentes tejidos que pueda localizarse (5). Esta zoonosis tiene muchas implicancias clinicas desde patologias oculares, viscerales, respiratorias y epidemiologicas (3,6), los metodos diagnosticos requieren de personal profesional entrenado (6). Clinicamente se pueden distinguir tres formas de presentacion de la enfermedad: el sindrome de Larva Migrans Visceral (SLMV), definido por un compromiso de organos como el higado, pulmon, piel, sistema nervioso, musculoesqueletico, rinon y corazon; el sindrome de Larva Migrans Ocular (OLM), caracterizado por una afeccion al ojo y a los nervios opticos y la Toxocariasis inaparente o encubierta, forma mas leve, que comprende un espectro clinico que va desde una infeccion casi asintomatica hasta la migracion de larvas a organos blanco especificos( 6,7). El SLMV es la manifestacion mas grave de Toxocariasis y se presenta particularmente en ninos menores de 5 anos (7). Es importante destacar que los articulos publicados sobre esta enfermedad en America Latina son limitados. En un estudio realizado en Lima – Peru se encontro 20,46% de seropositividad con alta proporcion en ninos de 1 a 10 anos (3). En otro estudio que se llevo a cabo al norte de Lima se encontro 31,1% (201/646) de los pacientes estudiados presentaron anticuerpos anti-toxocara(8). En una revision, se encontro que la seroprevalencia en America Latina oscila entre 1,8 y 66 % y varia en los paises, en Peru se aproxima el 32% de prevalencia, mientras que en Venezuela llega al 66% (9). La necesidad en el futuro de programas de control debe enfocarse en la biologia molecular de las proteinas que son usadas en inmunodiagnostico de VLM y OLM, asi como en el desarrollo de vacunas basadas en ADN que ofrezcan una proteccion de por vida. Anteriormente la identificacion de especies de Toxocara se determinaba por las caracteristicas morfologicas del parasito, sin embargo, actualmente se han desarrollado tecnicas moleculares mas precisas para el diagnostico, que implican el uso de ADN (10), pruebas serologicas para la deteccion de anticuerpos especificos mediante ensayos inmunoabsorbentes ligados a enzimas (ELISA) aumentando la sensibilidad y especificidad diagnostica, teniendo tambien menos reacciones cruzadas, asi como proteinas recombinantes para medir anticuerpos recombinantes especificos de Toxocara(2,11). El control adecuado de esta zoonosis parasitaria constituiria una gran disminucion de riesgos a la salud publica en paises en desarrollo, mayormente en el riesgo de infeccion en ninos menores de 10 anos que son mas susceptibles al contagio, y mas susceptibles a adquirir formas mas patogenas de Toxocariasis. Es necesario impulsar la colaboracion entre investigadores relacionada a la Toxocariasis, para lograr una investigacion superior a nivel mundial y sobre todo en los paises en desarrollo donde tiene mayor importancia por su alta incidencia, ademas tambien desde el punto de vista epidemiologico, clinico, la ecologico, molecular y tratamiento asociado con la Toxocariasis.",

        "title": "Consistent estimates of sea level and vertical land motion based on satellite radar altimetry",
        "abstract": "Satellite radar altimetry is often considered to be the most succesful spaceborne remote sensing technique ever. Satellite radar altimeters were designed for static geodetic and ocean dynamics applications. The goal of the geodetic mission phases, which have a dense ground-track spacing, is primarily to acquire information about the marine gravity field. This enables the estimation of mean dynamic topography (geographical sea surface height patterns due to ocean currents) and deep-ocean bathymetry. The primary goal of the oceanographic mission phases is to gain information about time-varying currents and ocean dynamics. TOPEX/Poseidon is the first altimetry mission to reveal sea surface height variations related to ocean dynamics as the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). During the mission it became clear that secular changes in sea level could also be monitored. Already in 1995, Nerem (1995) computed a Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) time series from the TOPEX/Poseidon data. Currently, the GMSL record spans 26 years, in which TOPEX/Poseidon time series is extended with the Jason-1a2a3 observations. The estimated secular trend of GMSL over the altimetry era is approximately 3 mm yr−1. The succes of the TOPEX/Poseidon mission spawned the Argo project with the deployment of the first floats in the year 2000. One argued that Argo would support the future Jason missions in separating changes into the two components (density and mass) of sea level. The Argo project aims to estimate temperature and salinity over a depth of 2000 meter using floats, which enable the estimation of density or steric sea level changes. By subtracting the steric signal from the absolute sea level measured by Jason (steric-corrected altimetry), the second component of sea level changes, mass, is estimated. The launch of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites in 2002 made it possible to independently validate oceanic mass variations. If the sum of the mass and steric components equals total sea level within the uncertainties, the sea level is said to be closed. Besides these two oceanic components, ocean bottom deformation or Vertical Land Motion (VLM) also affects the sea level observed by altimeters. Over the open ocean VLM signals are generally small after a correction for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), but near large mass variations they might become significant. Additionally, tide-gauge records are affected by VLM changes, because they are connected to land. Therefore they measure sea level relative to the sea floor, while the satellite altimeters observe the absolute variations. To bring tide gauges in the same reference frame as the altimeters, corrections for VLM have to be applied, which is usually done with nearby Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data...",

        "abstract": "One of the strategic decisions that can be made in supply chain is designing its network which has high impact on costs, and satisfaction level of customers. This paper focuses on designing a distribution network including determining the number and location of facilities, how to allocate the customers in network, and also determining the extent of carrying different products from different origins to different destinations; in this distribution network, according to the existing restrictions, customer demand is considered at minimum cost. In addition to secondary chain and reuse market as a retrieval option, model flexibility in defining quality and routing-locating is also among the innovation points of the model. Firstly, in forward chain the model consists of supplier, manufacturer, warehouse, distributor, and customer. In reverse chain, the model includes reuse market, secondary supply chain, collection, reprocess and disposal centers. The model could be generalized to industries with various strategies. Secondly, a sensitivity analysis was performed on a numerical example; also the nondominated sorting algorithm (NSGA II) was used for a large-sized sample; which its performance was measured by analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The results show that, returned products with average quality lead to lower costs and higher social benefits; and meta-heuristic NSGA II method is efficient. Because, it creates business opportunities and leads to less economic and environmental costs. doi: 10.5829/ije.2018.31.11b.16 NOMENCLATURE PARAMETERS qurem Minimum quality required for reprocessing k vjq qurec Minimum quality required for recycling P vji vcqa Operational cost of warehouse q for product a Q vjm vcia Operational cost of distributor i for product a I vjn vcma Operational cost of collector m for product a J vjl vcna Operational cost of reprocessor n for product a M vlpa vcla Operational cost of disposal center l for product a N vlq vjpa Number of jobs created due to producing a unit of product a by producer p L vjpa vjq Number of jobs created due to working at warehouse q O set of reuse markets (o=1,...,O) vji Number of jobs created due to working at distributor i S set of secondary supply chain (s=1,...,S) vjm Number of jobs created due to working at collector m C set of raw materials (c=1,...,C) vjn Number of jobs created due to working at reprocessor n A set of products (a=1,...,A) vjl Number of jobs created due to working at destruction center l V set of vehicle types (v=1,...,V) vlpa Lost days due to job losses during produce product a by producer p SETS vlq Lost days due to job losses during operations at warehouse q capk Maximum capacity of supplier k vli Lost days due to job losses during operations at distributor i capp Maximum capacity of producer p vlm Lost days due to job losses during operations at collector m *Coresponding Author Email: sahraeian@shahed.ac.ir (R.

        "title": "NIMG-89. DEEP LEARNING APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY INTRA-TUMORAL HETEROGENEITY OF LOW AND HIGH GRADE GLIOMAS",
        "abstract": "whereas it was not appreciated in 3 cases due to the tumor size. Bilateral involvement of the thalamus was noted in 7 patients on their initial scan, 1 patient had tumor confined to the cavum velum interpositum, which caused the abnormal signal in the thalamus bilaterally and 1 patient had left sided unilateral glioma which later progressed to the right side. CONCLUSIONS: Bithalamic tumors share a poor prognosis. Massa intermedia seems to be a possible route of spread of tumor from one thalamus to the other and subependymal region of the third ventricle may be contributing. These views open a newer channel for prophylactic radiation covering MI and third ven- tricle to prevent the intact thalamus and hence improve the prognosis of the patients. Genetic alterations found in WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas IDH1/2 and TERT promoter mutations 1p19q co-deletion, alterations are great impact on the prognosis of the patient. In this research, the authors attempted to test the hypothesis that genetic alterations could contribute to the locations and heterogeneity of the tumor by analyzing 191 WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas via MR radionomics. METHODS: 191 WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas were retrospectively col- lected and the genomic DNA of the tumor was sequenced for IDH1/2 and TERT promoter mutations. Treatment naive MR images were also collected. T2 weighted, T1 weighted, FLAIR and Gd-enhanced T1 weighted images were collected for analysis. Voxel-based lesion mapping (VLM), and redio- nomics analysis was performed for all images and were further challenged to construct a model that predicts genetic alterations within the tumor. 126 patients were allocated as training set and 65 for validation set. Patient cohort was divided into the following 3 groups; IDH mt/TERTp wt, IDH mt/TERTp mt and IDH wt. A multi-regression model was constructed using the training set to predict the 3 genetic subgroups and the validation set was used for model validation. RESULTS: VLM revealed that IDH mt/TERTp wt gliomas dominated temporal lobe involvement while IDH mt/TERTp mt occupied the frontal lobe. IDH wt tumors, on the other hand, located at much posterior lobes and centered at the deep white matter. 15 radio- nomic features were identified for model construction to predict 3 genetic subgroups of WHO grade 2 and 3 gliomas. When these 15 texture elements were used to construct a prediction model of the 3 genetic subgroups, AUCs calculated from the training set ranged from 0.7 to 0.75. Accuracy for pre- diction was 63% for the training set and 60% for the validation set. BACKGROUND: conventional benchmarks on various computer vision tasks. The present study evaluates a novel deep learning architecture in automatically predicting IDH mutation from conventional MRI and iden-tifying tumor sub-regions that are most characteristic of mutation status. METHODS: MR imaging data from The Cancer Imaging Archives and cor-responding genomic data were downloaded for patients with low (LGG) and high-grade gliomas (HGG). Only patients with full preoperative MR including T2, FLAIR, precontrast-T1 and postcontrast-T1 were analyzed. A novel 3D fully connected deep learning architecture was trained to predict the likelihood of IDH mutation at any given voxel. Final prediction for a given tumor was based on the mean prediction for the tumor volume. RESULTS: A total of 5,259 axial slices of tumor from 457 glioma patients (200 LGG, 257 HGG) were included for analysis. Overall the algorithm correctly predicted IDH mutation with 94% accuracy on five-fold cross- validation. The resulting heat map for voxel-wise prediction identifies tumor sub-regions containing features most characteristic of IDH mutation. Visu- ally these features include faint or absent enhancement as well as central cystic regions with FLAIR suppression. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning algorithm can predict IDH mutation with high accuracy from conventional MRI. In addition the algorithm is objective (requires no human interaction) and fast (several seconds from raw imaging data to prediction). Further investigation is ongoing to identify the best way to synthesize this data into clinical treatment paradigms. BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) is a non- invasive quantitative imaging technique, which allows rapid, simultaneous quantification of T1 and T2 relaxometry. We have demonstrated the ability of 2D single-slice MRF-based relaxometry to differentiate between various intraaxial brain tumors using first order statistics. In this study, we assess the utility of texture analysis on MRF quantitative maps to differentiate com-mon intra-axial adult brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sin- gle slice 2D-MRF acquisition was performed in 31 untreated brain tumors including 17 glioblastomas (GBM), 6 lower grade gliomas (LGG) and 8 metastases (METs). Regions of interest (ROI) for the solid tumor (ST) and peri-tumoral white matter (PW) (range: 0.32-12 and 0.25-2.5 cm 2 respec- tively) were drawn on quantitative T1 and T2 maps. Second-order texture features were calculated from gray level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM). Pearson correlation coefficients were applied for removal of redundant features. Five features including correlation, homogeneity, cluster-shade, information measure of correlation-1 and sum-average were compared across tumor types using the unpaired Student’s t-test and receiver operat- ing characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: In ST analysis, T1 correlation and T2 homogeneity of LGGs were higher compared to GBMs (p=0.009 and p=0.002 respectively). In PW analysis, T1 cluster-shade values of METs and LGGs were different (p= 0.004). There was difference in T2 correlation values between GBMs and METs (p=0.034). The ROC analysis revealed that T2 homogeneity of ST regions offers best separation between GBMs and LGGs with AUC of 0.91 (p=0.003) and between METs and LGGs with AUC of 0.94 (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: Texture analysis of MRF data improves characterization of tumoral and peri-tumoral regions and captures tissue heterogeneity above and beyond the first order features. MRF based texture analysis may offer a unique method for distinguishing various types of intraaxial adult brain tumors. BACKGROUND: Treatment-related imaging changes are often difficult to distinguish from true tumor progression. Treatment-related changes or pseudoprogression (PsP) subsequently subside or stabilize without any further treatment, whereas progressive tumor requires a more aggressive approach in patient management. Pseudoprogression can mimic true progression radi- ographically and may potentially alter the physician’s judgment about the recurrent disease. Hence, it can predispose a patient to overtreatment or be categorized as a non-responder and exclude him from the clinical trials. This study aims at assessing the potential of radiomics to discriminate PsP from progressive disease (PD) in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 304 GBM patients with new or increased enhance- ment on conventional MRI after treatment, of which it was uncertain for PsP versus PD. 149 patients had the histopathological evidence of PD and 27 of PsP. Remaining 128 patients were categorized into PD and PsP based on RANO criteria performed by a board-certified radiologist. Volumetrics using 3D slicer 4.3.1 and radiomics texture analysis were performed of the enhancing lesion(s) in question. RESULTS: Using the MRMR feature selec- tion method, we identified 100 significant features that were used to build a SVM model. Five texture features",

The sector \nconsidered embraces not only the activities directly connected with air transport, but also all those \nthat take place on site at the six Belgian airports (Antwerp, Brussels, Charleroi, Kortrijk, Liege and \nOstend). The study reviews the direct and indirect effects of the sector on the basis of \nmicroeconomic data (mainly obtained from the Central Balance Sheet Office) and mesoeconomic \ndata (from the National Accounts Institute). It also includes a social balance sheet analysis and an \nindication of credit risk using statistical models from the NBB’s In-house Credit Assessment System \n(ICAS). \nIn 2015, air transport and airport activities generated € 6 billion in direct and indirect value added \n(i.e. 1.5 % of Belgian GDP) and employed around 62 500 people in full-time equivalents (FTEs) \neither directly or indirectly (1.5 % of domestic employment including the self-employed). \nBrussels and Liege Airport remain the country’s biggest airports, respectively in terms of passenger \nand cargo traffic. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in March 2016, the regional airports \nreceived part of Brussels’ passenger traffic. All in all, Brussels recovered fairly quickly, especially \nfreight traffic, but also passenger traffic resumed gradually to tie in with growth again since \nNovember 2016. Brussels and Liege are the fastest growing airports during the 2013-2015 period, \nrespectively in terms of value added and employment. At Ostend Airport, these economic variables \nslumped in line with the evolution of freight traffic volumes.
