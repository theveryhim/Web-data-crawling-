        "abstract": "By decomposing the image formation process into a sequential application of denoising autoencoders, diffusion models (DMs) achieve state-of-the-art synthesis results on image data and beyond. Additionally, their formulation allows for a guiding mechanism to control the image generation process without retraining. However, since these models typically operate directly in pixel space, optimization of powerful DMs often consumes hundreds of GPU days and inference is expensive due to sequential evaluations. To enable DM training on limited computational resources while retaining their quality and flexibility, we apply them in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. In contrast to previous work, training diffusion models on such a representation allows for the first time to reach a near-optimal point between complexity reduction and detail preservation, greatly boosting visual fidelity. By introducing cross-attention layers into the model architecture, we turn diffusion models into powerful and flexible generators for general conditioning inputs such as text or bounding boxes and high-resolution synthesis becomes possible in a convolutional manner. Our latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve new state of the art scores for image inpainting and class-conditional image synthesis and highly competitive performance on various tasks, including unconditional image generation, text-to-image synthesis, and super-resolution, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based DMs.",

We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the super-resolution models.

We answer this in the affirmative, and introduce a family of diffusion-based generative models that obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on standard image density estimation benchmarks. Unlike other diffusion-based models, our method allows for efficient optimization of the noise schedule jointly with the rest of the model. We show that the variational lower bound (VLB) simplifies to a remarkably short expression in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio of the diffused data, thereby improving our theoretical understanding of this model class. Using this insight, we prove an equivalence between several models proposed in the literature. In addition, we show that the continuous-time VLB is invariant to the noise schedule, except for the signal-to-noise ratio at its endpoints. This enables us to learn a noise schedule that minimizes the variance of the resulting VLB estimator, leading to faster optimization. Combining these advances with architectural improvements, we obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on image density estimation benchmarks, outperforming autoregressive models that have dominated these benchmarks for many years, with often significantly faster optimization. In addition, we show how to use the model as part of a bits-back compression scheme, and demonstrate lossless compression rates close to the theoretical optimum.

This includes corruption with transition matrices that mimic Gaussian kernels in continuous space, matrices based on nearest neighbors in embedding space, and matrices that introduce absorbing states. The third allows us to draw a connection between diffusion models and autoregressive and mask-based generative models. We show that the choice of transition matrix is an important design decision that leads to improved results in image and text domains. We also introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss.

In this paper, we propose Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI), a novel time series imputation method that utilizes score-based diffusion models conditioned on observed data. Unlike existing score-based approaches, the conditional diffusion model is explicitly trained for imputation and can exploit correlations between observed values.

In addition, deterministic imputation by CSDI reduces the error by 5-20% compared to the state-of-the-art deterministic imputation methods.

To mitigate these problems and enable faithful manipulation of real images, we propose a novel method, dubbed DiffusionCLIP, that performs textdriven image manipulation using diffusion models.

Furthermore, its application to inverse problems have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. Unfortunately, diffusion models have a critical downside - they are inherently slow to sample from, needing few thousand steps of iteration to generate images from pure Gaussian noise. In this work, we show that starting from Gaussian noise is unnecessary. Instead, starting from a single forward diffusion with better initialization significantly reduces the number of sampling steps in the reverse conditional diffusion. This phenomenon is formally explained by the contraction theory of the stochastic difference equations like our conditional diffusion strategy - the alternating applications of reverse diffusion followed by a non-expansive data consistency step. The new sampling strategy, dubbed Come-Closer-Diffuse-Faster (CCDF), also reveals a new insight on how the existing feed-forward neural network approaches for inverse problems can be synergistically combined with the diffusion models.

ARDMs are simple to implement and easy to train. Unlike standard ARMs, they do not require causal masking of model representations, and can be trained using an efficient objective similar to modern probabilistic diffusion models that scales favourably to highly-dimensional data. At test time, ARDMs support parallel generation which can be adapted to fit any given generation budget. We find that ARDMs require significantly fewer steps than discrete diffusion models to attain the same performance. Finally, we apply ARDMs to lossless compression, and show that they are uniquely suited to this task. Contrary to existing approaches based on bits-back coding, ARDMs obtain compelling results not only on complete datasets, but also on compressing single data points. Moreover, this can be done using a modest number of network calls for (de)compression due to the model's adaptable parallel generation.",

Moreover, we introduce a multi-speed diffusion framework, which leads to a new estimator for the conditional score, performing on par with previous state-of-the-art approaches.

We show that a new lower bound tighter than the standard evidence lower bound can be derived as a surrogate objective for training the two networks. In particular, BDDMs are efficient, simple-to-train, and capable of further improving any pre-trained DDPM by optimizing the inference noise schedules. Our experiments demonstrated that BDDMs can generate high-fidelity samples with as few as 3 sampling steps and produce comparable or even higher quality samples than DDPMs using 1000 steps with only 16 sampling steps (a 62x speedup).",

Consequently, in recent years, there has been increasing attention on modelling non-local advection mathematically. These often take the form of partial differential equations, with integral terms modelling the non-locality. One common formalism is the aggregation-diffusion equation, a class of advection diffusion models with non-local advection. This was originally used to model a single population, but has recently been extended to the multi-species case to model the way organisms may alter their movement in the presence of coexistent species. Here we prove existence theorems for a class of non-local multi-species advection-diffusion models, with an arbitrary number of co-existent species. We prove global existence for models in n=1 spatial dimension and local existence for n>1. We describe an efficient spectral method for numerically solving these models and provide example simulation output. Overall, this helps provide a solid mathematical foundation for studying the effect of inter-species interactions on movement and space use.",

Classical registration algorithms usually rely on iterative optimization approaches to provide accurate deformation, which requires high computational cost. Although many deep-learning-based methods have been developed to carry out fast image registration, it is still challenging to estimate the deformation ﬁeld with less topological folding problem. Furthermore, these approaches only enable registration to a single ﬁxed image, and it is not possible to obtain continuously varying registration results between the moving and ﬁxed images. To address this, here we present a novel approach of diffusion model-based probabilistic image registration, called DiffuseMorph. Speciﬁcally, our model learns the score function of the deformation between moving and ﬁxed images. Similar to the existing diffusion models, Dif-fuseMorph not only provides synthetic deformed images through a reverse diffusion process, but also enables various levels of deformation of the moving image along with the latent space. Experimental results on 2D face expression image and 3D brain image registration tasks demonstrate that our method can provide ﬂexible and accurate deformation with a capability of topology preservation.",

We used an advanced diffusion MRI, Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging, to investigate the microstructural alterations due to demographics, common age-related pathological processes (amyloid, tau and white matter hyperintensities) and cognition. We also compared Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging findings to the older Diffusion Tensor Imaging model-based findings. Three hundred and twenty-eight participants (264 cognitively unimpaired, 57 mild cognitive impairment and 7 dementia with a mean age of 68.3 ± 13.1 years) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging with multi-shell diffusion imaging, fluid attenuated inversion recovery MRI as well as amyloid and tau PET scans were included in this study. White matter tract level diffusion measures were calculated from Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were performed with diffusion measures as the outcome and age, sex, education/occupation, white matter hyperintensities, amyloid and tau as predictors. Analyses were also performed with each diffusion MRI measure as a predictor of cognitive outcomes. Age and white matter hyperintensities were the strongest predictors of all white matter diffusion measures with low associations with amyloid and tau. However, neurite density decrease from Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging was observed with amyloidosis specifically in the temporal lobes. White matter integrity (mean diffusivity and free water) in the corpus callosum showed the greatest associations with cognitive measures. All diffusion measures provided information about white matter ageing and white matter changes due to age-related pathological processes and were associated with cognition. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging and diffusion tensor imaging are two different diffusion models that provide distinct information about variation in white matter microstructural integrity. Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging provides additional information about synaptic density, organization and free water content which may aid in providing mechanistic insights into disease progression.",

The GDDM framework augments traditional DDM parameters through arbitrary user-defined functions. Models are simulated numerically by directly solving the Fokker-Planck equation using efficient numerical methods, yielding a 100-fold or greater speedup over standard methodology. This speed allows GDDMs to be fit to data using maximum likelihood on the full response time (RT) distribution. We show that a GDDM fit with our framework explains a classic open dataset with better accuracy and fewer parameters than several DDMs implemented using the latest methodology.

Point cloud generation thus amounts to learning the reverse diffusion process that transforms the noise distribution to the distribution of a desired shape. Specifically, we propose to model the reverse diffusion process for point clouds as a Markov chain conditioned on certain shape latent. We derive the variational bound in closed form for training and provide implementations of the model.

The key property of the technique is its ability and flexibility to investigate linear and nonlinear models conveniently and accurately. The current study presents an improved algorithm to the variational iteration algorithm-II (VIA-II) for the numerical treatment of diffusion as well as convection-diffusion equations. This newly introduced modification is termed as the modified variational iteration algorithm-II (MVIA-II). The convergence of the MVIA-II is studied in the case of solving nonlinear equations. The main advantage of the MVIA-II improvement is an auxiliary parameter which makes sure a fast convergence of the standard VIA-II iteration algorithm. In order to verify the stability, accuracy, and computational speed of the method, the obtained solutions are compared numerically and graphically with the exact ones as well as with the results obtained by the previously proposed compact finite difference method and second kind Chebyshev wavelets. The comparison revealed that the modified version yields accurate results, converges rapidly, and offers better robustness in comparison with other methods used in the literature. Moreover, the basic idea depicted in this study is relied upon the possibility of the MVIA-II being utilized to handle nonlinear differential equations that arise in different fields of physical and biological sciences. A strong motivation for such applications is the fact that any discretization, transformation, or any assumptions are not required for this proposed algorithm in finding appropriate numerical solutions.",

Meanwhile, the lack of training data is common in painting-related machine learning tasks. Therefore, the synthesis of fine art painting is meaningful and challenging work. There are two main types of generative models for image synthesis: generative adversarial networks (GANs) and likelihood-based models. GAN-based models can obtain high-quality samples but usually sacrifice diversity and training stability. Diffusion models are a class of likelihood-based models and have recently been shown to achieve state-of-the-art quality on the image synthesis tasks. In this paper, we explore generating fine art paintings by using diffusion models. We carried out the experiments on the partial impression paintings from the Wikiart dataset. The results demonstrate that the diffusion model can generate high-quality samples, and it is easy to train to cover more target distribution than the GAN-based methods.",

        "abstract": "Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) have shown remarkable performance in unconditional image generation. However, due to the stochasticity of the generative process in DDPM, it is challenging to generate images with the desired semantics. In this work, we propose Iterative Latent Variable Refinement (ILVR), a method to guide the generative process in DDPM to generate high-quality images based on a given reference image. Here, the refinement of the generative process in DDPM enables a single DDPM to sample images from various sets directed by the reference image. The proposed ILVR method generates high-quality images while controlling the generation. The controllability of our method allows adaptation of a single DDPM without any additional learning in various image generation tasks, such as generation from various downsampling factors, multi-domain image translation, paint-to-image, and editing with scribbles.",

A super-resolution (SR) technique is explored to reconstruct high-resolution images ($4\\times$) from lower resolution images in an advection-diffusion model of atmospheric pollution plumes. SR performance is generally increased when the advection-diffusion equation constrains the NN in addition to conventional pixel-based constraints. The ability of SR techniques to also reconstruct missing data is investigated by randomly removing image pixels from the simulations and allowing the system to learn the content of missing data. Improvements in S/N of $11\\%$ are demonstrated when physics equations are included in SR with $40\\%$ pixel loss. Physics-informed NNs accurately reconstruct corrupted images and generate better results compared to the standard SR approaches.",

The scope of the research included manganese sorption kinetic test on natural mineral sorbents at temperatures of 10, 17.5 and 25 °C in slightly acidic conditions. Sorption (pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and Elovich models) and diffusion kinetic models (liquid film diffusion and intraparticle diffusion) were used in the analysis of test results. The manganese sorption process on both tuff and basalt proceeded quickly. The dynamic equilibrium state of manganese sorption settled after 35 and 45 min on tuff and basalt respectively. Although the process took place in a slightly acidic environment and below pHPZC of the sorbents, possible electrostatic repulsion did not inhibit the removal of Mn. The Mn sorption on both materials followed the PSO kinetics model. Based on the diffusion kinetic models, it was determined that Mn sorption process on both materials was influenced by diffusion through the boundary layer and intraparticle diffusion. The differences in removal efficiency and rate of Mn sorption in the temperature range of 10–25 °C were not found.",

Adoptee countries are categorized based on Rogers’ adopter categorizations to understand country characteristics. Innovation diffusion models such as internal influence, external influence and bass diffusion that explain diffusion patterns are applied to the cumulative adoption of IFRS. Coefficients of internal and external diffusion are obtained using the models to explain the mode of diffusion pattern of IFRS. Further tests are done to identify the best model that explains IFRS diffusion.\n\n\nFindings\nFindings show that IFRS diffusion is a result of external influence through vertical communication from a centralized body (IASB) and internal influence due to imitation and interpersonal communication between countries. Imitation effect among the countries has a stronger effect on the IFRS adoption compared to the communication obtained from IASB.\n\n\nPractical implications\nFindings obtained can help standards-setting bodies, organizations and countries to understand the potential future of adopters and non-adopters. It facilitates the standard-setting bodies to manage IFRS diffusion by implementing measures to spread the word on the benefits of IFRS.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe study generates value by modeling a successive increase in the number of IFRS adoptee countries using empirical methods and identifies the reasons for the diffusion life cycle of IFRS.\n",

        "abstract": "Many modern outer radiation belt models simulate the long‐time behavior of high‐energy electrons by solving a three‐dimensional Fokker‐Planck equation for the drift‐ and bounce‐averaged electron phase space density that includes radial, pitch‐angle, and energy diffusion. Radial diffusion is an important process, often characterized by a deterministic diffusion coefficient. One widely used parameterization is based on the median of statistical ultralow frequency (ULF) wave power for a particular geomagnetic index Kp. We perform idealized numerical ensemble experiments on radial diffusion, introducing temporal and spatial variability to the diffusion coefficient through stochastic parameterization, constrained by statistical properties of its underlying observations. Our results demonstrate the sensitivity of radial diffusion over a long time period to the full distribution of the radial diffusion coefficient, highlighting that information is lost when only using median ULF wave power. When temporal variability is included, ensembles exhibit greater diffusion with more rapidly varying diffusion coefficients, larger variance of the diffusion coefficients and for distributions with heavier tails. When we introduce spatial variability, the variance in the set of all ensemble solutions increases with larger spatial scales of variability. Our results demonstrate that the variability of diffusion affects the temporal evolution of phase space density in the outer radiation belt. We discuss the need to identify important temporal and length scales to constrain variability in diffusion models. We suggest that the application of stochastic parameterization techniques in the diffusion equation may allow the inclusion of natural variability and uncertainty in modeling of wave‐particle interactions in the inner magnetosphere.",

These equations were derived from Shockley’s work on modelling semiconductors in the late 1940s. However, it was pointed out by Cao et al and Gregg that diffusion model is more suitable for modelling DSSCs. Since the study by Södergren in 1994, the diffusion model has become prevalent in literature and the development of this model by including additional equations to incorporate electrolyte concentrations, time dependence for charge carrier densities and nonlinear diffusivity has shown to capture more complex processes of charge transport within DSSCs.

We conducted simulation experiments to assess numerical error, computational requirements, and accuracy recovering known model parameters. A reanalysis of soybean SNP data demonstrates that the models implemented in Snapp and Snapper can be difficult to distinguish in practice, a characteristic which we tested with further simulations.

        "abstract": "We present an overview of diffusion models commonly used for quantifying the dynamics of intracellular particles (e.g. biomolecules) inside eukaryotic living cells. It is established that inference on the modes of mobility of molecules is central in cell biology since it reflects interactions between structures and determines functions of biomolecules in the cell. In that context, Brownian motion is a key component in short distance transportation (e.g. connectivity for signal transduction). Another dynamical process that has been heavily studied in the past decade is the motor-mediated transport (e.g. dynein, kinesin and myosin) of molecules. Primarily supported by actin filament and microtubule network, it ensures spatial organization and temporal synchronization in the intracellular mechanisms and structures. Nevertheless, the complexity of internal structures and molecular processes in the living cell influence the molecular dynamics and prevent the systematic application of pure Brownian or directed motion modeling. On the one hand, cytoskeleton density will hinder the free displacement of the particle, a phenomenon called subdiffusion. On the other hand, the cytoskeleton elasticity combined with thermal bending can contribute a phenomenon called superdiffusion. This paper discusses the basics of diffusion modes observed in eukariotic cells, by introducing the essential properties of these processes. Applications of diffusion models include protein trafficking and transport and membrane diffusion.",

On the basis of IMEX‐BDF2 time semi‐discrete method, we derive a fourth‐order compact (FOC) finite difference scheme for spatial discretization. Since the payoff function of the option at the strike price is not differentiable, the results show only second‐order accuracy in space. To remedy this, a local mesh refinement strategy is used near the strike price so that the accuracy achieves fourth order.

Over the last few decades, several mathematical models have been used to study despeckling and have influenced policy. This paper review and compare the partial differential equation-based non-linear diffusion models for despeckling of digital grey scale natural and real images, available in the literature. First, we present a detailed study of different classes of partial differential equation-based models namely, logarithmic transform, anisotropic diffusion, and total variation based models, which have different assumptions about noise removal and explore the effect of treatments. Then, to test the effectiveness of different discussed classes of PDE-based models, a set of natural images with different geometric regions, three real ultrasound images and two real SAR images are used. Also, to assess the quality of considered test images after despeckling using numeric metrics, three with-reference and two without-reference indexes are used in the experimental study. A few experiments with natural and real images reveal that the filters based on logarithmic transformation are cost effective with low noise suppression capability. Whereas, the anisotropic diffusion and total variation-based approaches show the good filtering performance with high computational cost. Therefore, rigorous qualitative and quantitative studies confirm that the seemingly subtle variation in model assumptions can have remarkable impact on despeckling.",

        "abstract": "Bayesian inference for nonlinear diffusions, observed at discrete times, is a challenging task that has prompted the development of a number of algorithms, mainly within the computational statistics community. We propose a new direction, and accompanying methodology—borrowing ideas from statistical physics and computational chemistry—for inferring the posterior distribution of latent diffusion paths and model parameters, given observations of the process. Joint configurations of the underlying process noise and of parameters, mapping onto diffusion paths consistent with observations, form an implicitly defined manifold. Then, by making use of a constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm on the embedded manifold, we are able to perform computationally efficient inference for a class of discretely observed diffusion models. Critically, in contrast with other approaches proposed in the literature, our methodology is highly automated, requiring minimal user intervention and applying alike in a range of settings, including: elliptic or hypo‐elliptic systems; observations with or without noise; linear or non‐linear observation operators. Exploiting Markovianity, we propose a variant of the method with complexity that scales linearly in the resolution of path discretisation and the number of observation times.

        "abstract": "The stochastic drift-diffusion (DrDiff) theory is an approach used to characterize the dynamical properties of simulation data. With new features in transition times analyses, the framework characterized the thermodynamic free-energy profile [F(Q)], the folding time (τf), and transition path time (τTP) by determining the coordinate-dependent drift-velocity [v(Q)] and diffusion [D(Q)] coefficients from trajectory time traces. In order to explore the DrDiff approach and to tune it with two other methods (Bayesian analysis and fep1D algorithm), a numerical integration of the Langevin equation with known D(Q) and F(Q) was performed and the inputted coefficients were recovered with success by the diffusion models. DrDiff was also applied to investigate the prion protein (PrP) kinetics and thermodynamics by analyzing folding/unfolding simulations. The protein structure-based model, the well-known Go¯-model, was employed in a coarse-grained Cα level to generate long constant-temperature time series. PrP was chosen due to recent experimental single-molecule studies in D and τTP that stressed the importance and the difficulty of probing these quantities and the rare transition state events related to prion misfolding and aggregation. The PrP thermodynamic double-well F(Q) profile, the \"X\" shape of τf(T), and the linear shape of τTP(T) were predicted with v(Q) and D(Q) obtained by the DrDiff algorithm. With the advance of single-molecule techniques, the DrDiff framework might be a useful ally for determining kinetic and thermodynamic properties by analyzing time observables of biomolecular systems.

        "abstract": "Realistic electrocardiogram (ECG) simulation with numerical models is important for research linking cellular and molecular physiology to clinically observable signals, and crucial for patient tailoring of numerical heart models. However, ECG simulation with a realistic torso model is computationally much harder than simulation of cardiac activity itself, so that many studies with sophisticated heart models have resorted to crude approximations of the ECG. This paper shows how the classical concept of electrocardiographic lead fields can be used for an ECG simulation method that matches the realism of modern heart models. The accuracy and resource requirements were compared to those of a full-torso solution for the potential and scaling was tested up to 14,336 cores with a heart model consisting of 11 million nodes. Reference ECGs were computed on a 3.3 billion-node heart-torso mesh at 0.2 mm resolution. The results show that the lead-field method is more efficient than a full-torso solution when the number of simulated samples is larger than the number of computed ECG leads. While the initial computation of the lead fields remains a hard and poorly scalable problem, the ECG computation itself scales almost perfectly and, even for several hundreds of ECG leads, takes much less time than the underlying simulation of cardiac activity.",

Markov chain approximation is a computationally efficient approach for this problem. This paper undertakes the challenge of analyzing its convergence rate when model coefficients are nonsmooth. We obtain sharp estimates of convergence rates for the value function and its first and second derivatives, which are generally first order. To improve convergence rates to second order, we propose two methods: following the midpoint rule that places all nonsmooth points midway between two neighboring grid points or applying a smoothing technique named as harmonic averaging to the model coefficients. Comparison with a widely used finite difference scheme for PDEs with nonsmooth coefficients shows the superiority of our approach. We also generalize the midpoint rule to achieve second-order convergence for two-dimensional diffusions. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical estimates.",

        "abstract": "Drift diffusion (or evidence accumulation) models have found widespread use in the modelling of simple decision tasks. Extensions of these models, in which the model’s instantaneous drift rate is not fixed but instead allowed to vary over time as a function of a stream of perceptual inputs, have allowed these models to account for more complex sensorimotor decision tasks. However, many real-world tasks seemingly rely on a myriad of even more complex underlying processes. One interesting example is the task of deciding whether to cross a road with an approaching vehicle. This action decision seemingly depends on sensory information both about own affordances (whether one can make it across before the vehicle) and action intention of others (whether the vehicle is yielding to oneself). Here, we compared three extensions of a standard drift diffusion model, with regards to their ability to capture timing of pedestrian crossing decisions in a virtual reality environment. We find that a single variable-drift diffusion model (S-VDDM) in which the varying drift rate is determined by visual quantities describing vehicle approach and deceleration, saturated at an upper and lower bound, can explain multimodal distributions of crossing times well across a broad range vehicle approach scenarios. More complex models, which attempt to partition the final crossing decision into constituent perceptual decisions, improve the fit to the human data but further work is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn from this finding.",

Purpose To compare the utility of various metrics derived from monoexponential model (MEM), biexponential model (BEM), stretched-exponential model (SEM) based diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in the differential diagnosis of prostate cancer. Material and Methods Thirty-three patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination. Multi-b value and multi-direction DWIs were performed. In-bore MR-guided biopsy was performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), pure molecular diffusion (ADCslow), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (ADCfast), perfusion fraction (f), water molecular diffusion heterogeneity index (α), distributed diffusion coefficient (DDC), non-Gaussian diffusion coefficient (MD), and mean kurtosis (MK) values were calculated and compared between cancerous and non-cancerous groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for all parameters and models. Results ADC, ADCslow, DDC, and MD values were significantly lower while MK value was significantly higher in prostate cancer than those of prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia. ADC, ADCslow, DDC, MD, and MK could discriminate between tumor and non-tumorous lesions (area under the curve, 0.856, 0.835, 0.866, 0.918, and 0.937, respectively). MK was superior to ADC in the discrimination of prostate cancer. DKI was superior to MEM in the discrimination of prostate cancer. Conclusions Parameters derived from both Gaussian and non-Gaussian models could characterize prostate cancer. DKI may be advantageous than DWI for detection of prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The primary aim of this prospective observational study was to assess whether diffusion MRI metrics correlate with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) status in grade II and III gliomas. A secondary aim was to investigate whether multishell acquisitions with advanced models such as neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging offer greater diagnostic accuracy than diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI). Materials and Methods Diffusion MRI (b = 700 and 2000 sec/mm2) was performed preoperatively in 192 consecutive participants (113 male and 79 female participants; mean age, 46.18 years; age range, 14-77 years) with grade II (n = 62), grade III (n = 58), or grade IV (n = 72) gliomas. DTI, diffusion kurtosis imaging, and NODDI metrics were measured in regions with or without hyperintensity on diffusion MR images and compared among groups defined according to IDH genotype, 1p/19q codeletion status, and tumor grade by using Mann-Whitney tests. Results In grade II and III IDH wild-type gliomas, the maximum fractional anisotropy, kurtosis anisotropy, and restriction fraction were significantly higher and the minimum mean diffusivity was significantly lower than in IDH-mutant gliomas (P = .011, P = .002, P = .044, and P = .027, respectively); areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.72 to 0.76. In IDH wild-type gliomas, no difference among grades II, III, and IV was found. In IDH-mutant gliomas, no difference between those with and those without 1p/19q loss was found. Conclusion Diffusion MRI metrics showed correlation with isocitrate dehydrogenase status in grade II and III gliomas. Advanced diffusion MRI models did not add diagnostic accuracy, supporting the inclusion of a single-shell diffusion-tensor imaging acquisition in brain tumor imaging protocols. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "abstract": "On an industrial scale, the efficiency of heterogeneous catalysis is commonly subject to diffusive transport limitations. The binary friction model (BFM) combines Maxwell–Stefan-type diffusion, pore effects and viscous contributions for multicomponent reaction mixtures. A variety of catalyst shapes have been developed over the years to overcome transport problems. However, rigorous modeling of multicomponent diffusion–reaction problems in 3D geometries remains an ongoing challenge. We successfully applied the BFM to nine shapes, all varying in size and catalyst loading. The volume-to-surface ratio and the curvature of the bodies were found to be the characteristic features of the pellets, describing the reaction–diffusion interplay. With this, the 3D shape can be adequately approximated with straightforward 1D strategies. Finally, a comparison to Fickian diffusion models highlights the similarities and discrepancies to the Maxwell–Stefan concept of the BFM. These findings can contribute to an integral des...",

In addition, based on the data collected, forecasting models were developed to assess at which extent the multiple certifications are expected to occur in each studied country.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nData concerning the evolution of the amount of multiple MSs in Italy, Portugal and Spain were collected for the period between 1999 and 2015. The behavior of the evolution of the number of MSs over the years was studied adopting both the Gompertz and the Logistic models. The results obtained with these two models were compared and analyzed to provide a forecast for the next years.\n\n\nFindings\nThe diffusion throughout the years of the number of MSs presents an S-shaped behavior. The evolution of the amount of MSs in countries with a lower saturation level are properly fitted by the Gompertz model whereas the Logistic model fits more accurately when considering countries with a larger saturation level.\n\n\nResearch limitations/implications\nThe data related to the early years are not available in some of the countries. To overcome this shortcoming missing data were extrapolated from the data set provided by the annual ISO survey. Additionally, the integration level attained by each company was not assessed and, on this regard and in the scope of this paper, an integrated management system is understood as implemented when organizations have multiple MSs implemented.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe results provide a cross-sectional portrayal of the diffusion of MSs certifications in the South European countries and enable a forecast for the trend in the next years.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThis study aims for the first time, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, to analyze the diffusion of multiple MSs throughout the years.\n",

        "abstract": "Today many countries around the world have adopted Electric Vehicles (EVs) to reduce air pollution, oil consumption and fossil fuel dependence. Morocco is one of these sustainability based committed countries, especially that its transport sector depends on oil, which is entirely imported from outside of the country. In this sense, the aim of this paper is to predict the diffusion of EVs in Moroccan market by three models Gompertz, Logistic and Bass. Then the best model that fits well our data is chosen, based on R-square and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). In addition, we have assessed the interaction between the cumulative sales of EVs and the battery price, using the Generalized Bass Diffusion Model. Results show that the Moroccan market reaches the maximum sales of EVs, after 14 years and the battery cost has a great effect on the market diffusion, a decreasing of the battery price could accelerate the diffusion of EVs market.",

In the proposed compact scheme, the second derivative approximation of the unknowns is approximated using the value of these unknowns and their first derivative approximations, thereby allowing us to obtain a tridiagonal system of linear equations for a fully discrete problem. Moreover, the consistency and stability of the proposed compact scheme are proved. Owing to the low regularity of typical initial conditions, a smoothing operator is employed to ensure the fourth-order convergence rate. Numerical illustrations concerning the pricing of European options under the Merton’s and Kou’s jump-diffusion models are presented to validate the theoretical results.",

        "abstract": "Information diffusion is a natural phenomenon occurring in social networks. The adoption behavior of a node toward an information piece in a social network can be affected by different factors, e.g., freshness and hotness. Previously, many diffusion models are proposed to consider one or several fixed factors. In fact, the factors affecting adoption decision of a node are different from one to another and may not be seen before. For a different scenario of diffusion with new factors, previous diffusion models may not model the diffusion well, or are not applicable at all. Moreover, uncertainty of information exposure intrinsically exists between two connected nodes, which causes modeling diffusion more challenge in social networks. In this work, our aim is to design a diffusion model in which factors considered are flexible to be extended and changed and the uncertainly of information exposure is explicitly tackled. Therefore, with different factors, our diffusion model can be adapted to more scenarios of diffusion without requiring the modification of the learning framework. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that our diffusion model is effective on two important tasks of information diffusion, namely activation prediction and spread estimation.",

        "abstract": "Conflict tasks are one of the most widely studied paradigms within cognitive psychology, where participants are required to respond based on relevant sources of information while ignoring conflicting irrelevant sources of information. The flanker task, in particular, has been the focus of considerable modeling efforts, with only 3 models being able to provide a complete account of empirical choice response time distributions: the dual-stage 2-phase model (DSTP), the shrinking spotlight model (SSP), and the diffusion model for conflict tasks (DMC). Although these models are grounded in different theoretical frameworks, can provide diverging measures of cognitive control, and are quantitatively distinguishable, no previous study has compared all 3 of these models in their ability to account for empirical data. Here, we perform a comparison of the precise quantitative predictions of these models through Bayes factors, using probability density approximation to generate a pseudolikelihood estimate of the unknown probability density function, and thermodynamic integration via differential evolution to approximate the analytically intractable Bayes factors. We find that for every participant across 3 data sets from 3 separate research groups, DMC provides an inferior account of the data to DSTP and SSP, which has important theoretical implications regarding cognitive processes engaged in the flanker task, and practical implications for applying the models to flanker data. More generally, we argue that our combination of probability density approximation with marginal likelihood approximation-which we term pseudolikelihood Bayes factors-provides a crucial step forward for the future of model comparison, where Bayes factors can be calculated between any models that can be simulated. We also discuss the limitations of simulation-based methods, such as the potential for approximation error, and suggest that researchers should use analytically or numerically computed likelihood functions when they are available and computationally tractable.

(2021) show that diffusion processes that transform data into noise can be reversed via learning the score function, i.e. the gradient of the log-density of the perturbed data. They propose to plug the learned score function into an inverse formula to define a generative diffusion process. Despite the empirical success, a theoretical underpinning of this procedure is still lacking. In this work, we approach the (continuous-time) generative diffusion directly and derive a variational framework for likelihood estimation, which includes continuous-time normalizing flows as a special case, and can be seen as an infinitely deep variational autoencoder. Under this framework, we show that minimizing the score-matching loss is equivalent to maximizing a lower bound of the likelihood of the plug-in reverse SDE proposed by Song et al.

Additional encoding layers and a decoder are then used to iteratively refine the segmentation map, using a diffusion model. Since the diffusion model is probabilistic, it is applied multiple times, and the results are merged into a final segmentation map.

This early advantage, however, switches to a reaction time cost and has been termed inhibition of return (IOR). IOR behaves differently for different response modalities, suggesting that it may not be a unified effect. This letter presents new data from two experiments testing the gradient of IOR with random, continuous cue-target Euclidean distance and cue-target onset asynchrony. These data were then used to train multiple diffusion models of saccadic and manual reaction time for these cuing experiments. Diffusion models can generate accurate distributions of reaction time data by modeling a response as a buildup of evidence toward a response threshold. If saccadic and attentional IOR are based on similar processes, then differences in distribution will be best explained by adjusting parameter values such as signal and noise within the same model structure. Although experimental data show differences in the timing of IOR across modality, best-fit models are shown to have similar model parameters for the gradient of IOR, suggesting similar underlying mechanisms for saccadic and manual IOR.",

Chan and S. Hubbert, A numerical study of radial basis function based methods for options pricing under the one dimension jump-diffusion model, Tech. Rep., 2010; A. Saib, D. Tangman, and M. Bhuruth, A new radial basis functions method for pricing American options under Merton's jump-diffusion model, Int. J. Comput. Math. 89 (2012), pp. 1164–1185]. Indeed, only a strong form of meshless methods have been employed in these lectures. We propose the local weak form meshless methods for option pricing under Merton and Kou jump-diffusion models. Predominantly in this work we will focus on meshless local Petrov–Galerkin, local boundary integral equation methods based on moving least square approximation and local radial point interpolation based on Wendland's compactly supported radial basis functions. The key feature of this paper is applying a Richardson extrapolation technique on American option which is a free boundary problem to obtain a fixed boundary problem. Also the implicit–explicit time stepping scheme is employed for the time derivative which allows us to obtain a spars and banded linear system of equations. Numerical experiments are presented showing that the presented approaches are extremely accurate and fast.",

The main argument has been that while diffusion models always overestimate the true axon diameter, their estimation still correlates with changes in true value. Until now, this remains more as a discussion point. The aim of this paper is to clarify this hypothesis using a recently acquired cat spinal cord data set, where the diffusion MRI signal of both a multi-shell and Ax-Caliber acquisition have been registered with the underlying histology values. We find that the axon diameter as estimated by signal models and AxCaliber does not correlate with their true sizes for axon diameters smaller than 3 µm. On the other hand, we also train a random forest machine learning algorithm to map signal-based features to histology values of axon diameter and volume fraction. The results show that, in this dataset, this approach leads to a more reliable estimation of physically relevant axon diameters than using sophisticated diffusion models.",

D2C uses a learned diffusion-based prior over the latent representations to improve generation and contrastive self-supervised learning to improve representation quality. D2C can adapt to novel generation tasks conditioned on labels or manipulation constraints, by learning from as few as 100 labeled examples. On conditional generation from new labels, D2C achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art VAEs and diffusion models. On conditional image manipulation, D2C generations are two orders of magnitude faster to produce over StyleGAN2 ones and are preferred by 50% - 60% of the human evaluators in a double-blind study.",

We find the performance of a particular method depends on data domains (e.g., image or audio), the trade-off between sampling speed and sample quality, and the amount of conditional information. We further provide insights and recipes on the choice of methods for practitioners.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The use of the turbulent eddy diffusion model and its variants in exposure assessment is limited due to the lack of knowledge regarding the isotropic eddy diffusion coefficient, DT. But some studies have suggested a possible relationship between DT and the air changes per hour (ACH) through a room. The main goal of this study was to accurately estimate DT for a range of ACH values by minimizing the difference between the concentrations measured and predicted by eddy diffusion model. We constructed an experimental chamber with a spatial concentration gradient away from the contaminant source, and conducted 27 3-hr long experiments using toluene and acetone under different air flow conditions (0.43–2.89 ACHs). An eddy diffusion model accounting for chamber boundary, general ventilation, and advection was developed. A mathematical expression for the slope based on the geometrical parameters of the ventilation system was also derived. There is a strong linear relationship between DT and ACH, providing a surrogate parameter for estimating DT in real-life settings. For the first time, a mathematical expression for the relationship between DT and ACH has been derived that also corrects for non-ideal conditions, and the calculated value of the slope between these two parameters is very close to the experimentally determined value. The values of DT obtained from the experiments are generally consistent with values reported in the literature. They are also independent of averaging time of measurements, allowing for comparison of values obtained from different measurement settings. These findings make the use of turbulent eddy diffusion models for exposure assessment in workplace/indoor environments more practical.",

        "abstract": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have emerged as a powerful family of generative models that can yield high-fidelity samples and competitive log-likelihoods across a range of domains, including image and speech synthesis. Key advantages of DDPMs include ease of training, in contrast to generative adversarial networks, and speed of generation, in contrast to autoregressive models. However, DDPMs typically require hundreds-to-thousands of steps to generate a high fidelity sample, making them prohibitively expensive for high dimensional problems. Fortunately, DDPMs allow trading generation speed for sample quality through adjusting the number of refinement steps as a post process. Prior work has been successful in improving generation speed through handcrafting the time schedule by trial and error. We instead view the selection of the inference time schedules as an optimization problem, and introduce an exact dynamic programming algorithm that finds the optimal discrete time schedules for any pre-trained DDPM. Our method exploits the fact that ELBO can be decomposed into separate KL terms, and given any computation budget, discovers the time schedule that maximizes the training ELBO exactly. Our method is efficient, has no hyper-parameters of its own, and can be applied to any pre-trained DDPM with no retraining. We discover inference time schedules requiring as few as 32 refinement steps, while sacrificing less than 0.1 bits per dimension compared to the default 4,000 steps used on ImageNet 64x64 [Ho et al., 2020; Nichol and Dhariwal, 2021].",

This paper introduces two new classes of generative models for categorical data such as language or image segmentation: Argmax Flows and Multinomial Diffusion . Argmax Flows are deﬁned by a composition of a continuous distribution (such as a normalizing ﬂow), and an argmax function. To optimize this model, we learn a probabilistic inverse for the argmax that lifts the categorical data to a continuous space. Multinomial Diffusion gradually adds categorical noise in a diffusion process, for which the generative denoising process is learned.

Inspired by recent progress on diffusion probabilistic models, we present a diffusion recovery likelihood method to tractably learn and sample from a sequence of EBMs trained on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset. Each EBM is trained by maximizing the recovery likelihood: the conditional probability of the data at a certain noise level given their noisy versions at a higher noise level. The recovery likelihood objective is more tractable than the marginal likelihood objective, since it only requires MCMC sampling from a relatively concentrated conditional distribution. Moreover, we show that this estimation method is theoretically consistent: it learns the correct conditional and marginal distributions at each noise level, given sufficient data. After training, synthesized images can be generated efficiently by a sampling process that initializes from a spherical Gaussian distribution and progressively samples the conditional distributions at decreasingly lower noise levels. Our method generates high fidelity samples on various image datasets. On unconditional CIFAR-10 our method achieves FID 9.60 and inception score 8.58, superior to the majority of GANs. Moreover, we demonstrate that unlike previous work on EBMs, our long-run MCMC samples from the conditional distributions do not diverge and still represent realistic images, allowing us to accurately estimate the normalized density of data even for high-dimensional datasets.",

The limiting latent object is an Ito diffusion process that solves a stochastic differential equation (SDE) whose drift and diffusion coefficient are implemented by neural nets. We develop a variational inference framework for these \\textit{neural SDEs} via stochastic automatic differentiation in Wiener space, where the variational approximations to the posterior are obtained by Girsanov (mean-shift) transformation of the standard Wiener process and the computation of gradients is based on the theory of stochastic flows. This permits the use of black-box SDE solvers and automatic differentiation for end-to-end inference. Experimental results with synthetic data are provided.",

Methods We included 50 patients with sporadic and 59 patients with genetically defined SVD (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy [CADASIL]) with cognitive testing and standardized 3T MRI, including multi-shell diffusion imaging. We applied the simple diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model and 2 advanced models: diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI). Linear regression and multivariable random forest regression (including conventional SVD markers) were used to determine associations between diffusion metrics and processing speed performance. The detection of short-term disease progression was assessed by linear mixed models in 49 patients with sporadic SVD with longitudinal high-frequency imaging (in total 459 MRIs). Intersite reproducibility was determined in 10 patients with CADASIL scanned back-to-back on 2 different 3T MRI scanners. Results Metrics from DKI showed the strongest associations with processing speed performance (R2 up to 21%) and the largest added benefit on top of conventional SVD imaging markers in patients with sporadic SVD and patients with CADASIL with lower SVD burden. Several metrics from DTI and DKI performed similarly in detecting disease progression. Reproducibility was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.93) for DTI and DKI metrics. NODDI metrics were less reproducible. Conclusion Multi-shell diffusion imaging and DKI improve the detection and characterization of cognitively relevant microstructural white matter alterations in SVD. Excellent reproducibility of diffusion metrics endorses their use as SVD markers in research and clinical care. Our publicly available intersite dataset facilitates future studies. Classification of evidence This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with SVD, diffusion MRI metrics are associated with processing speed performance.",

We calculate bounce‐averaged diffusion coefficients, using quasi‐linear theory, for each individual Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) EMIC wave observation using fitted wave properties, the plasma density and the background magnetic field. These calculations are then combined into bounce‐averaged diffusion coefficients. The resulting coefficients therefore capture the combined effects of individual spectra and plasma properties as opposed to previous approaches that use average spectral and plasma properties, resulting in diffusion over a wider range of energies and pitch angles. These calculations, and their role in radiation belt simulations, are then compared against existing diffusion models.

        "abstract": "Diffusion MRI is arguably the method of choice for characterizing white matter microstructure in vivo. Over the typical duration of diffusion encoding, the displacement of water molecules is conveniently on a length scale similar to that of the underlying cellular structures. Moreover, water molecules in white matter are largely compartmentalized which enables biologically-inspired compartmental diffusion models to characterize and quantify the true biological microstructure. A plethora of white matter models have been proposed. However, overparameterization and mathematical fitting complications encourage the introduction of simplifying assumptions that vary between different approaches. These choices impact the quantitative estimation of model parameters with potential detriments to their biological accuracy and promised specificity. First, we review biophysical white matter models in use and recapitulate their underlying assumptions and realms of applicability. Second, we present up-to-date efforts to validate parameters estimated from biophysical models. Simulations and dedicated phantoms are useful in assessing the performance of models when the ground truth is known. However, the biggest challenge remains the validation of the \"biological accuracy\" of estimated parameters. Complementary techniques such as microscopy of fixed tissue specimens have facilitated direct comparisons of estimates of white matter fiber orientation and densities. However, validation of compartmental diffusivities remains challenging, and complementary MRI-based techniques such as alternative diffusion encodings, compartment-specific contrast agents and metabolites have been used to validate diffusion models. Finally, white matter injury and disease pose additional challenges to modeling, which are also discussed. This review aims to provide an overview of the current state of models and their validation and to stimulate further research in the field to solve the remaining open questions and converge towards consensus.",

Therefore, online social networks can reflect the structure of offline human society. A piece of information can be exchanged or diffused between individuals in social networks. From this diffusion process, lots of latent information can be mined. It can be used for market predicting, rumor controlling, and opinion monitoring among other things. However, the research of these applications depends on the diffusion models and methods. For this reason, we survey various information diffusion models from recent decades. From a research process view, we divide the diffusion models into two categories—explanatory models and predictive models—in which the former includes epidemics and influence models and the latter includes independent cascade, linear threshold, and game theory models. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the research methods and techniques, and compare them according to the above categories. The whole research structure of the information diffusion models based on our view is given. There is a discussion at the end of each section, detailing related models that are mentioned in the literature. We conclude that these two models are not independent, they always complement each other. Finally, the issues of the social networks research are discussed and summarized, and directions for future study are proposed.",

However, early and accurate indicators of innovation and the recognition of trends in innovation are mandatory to successfully promote economic growth through technological progress via evidence-based policy making. In this study, we propose Paragraph Vector Topic Model (PVTM) and apply it to technology-related news articles to analyze innovation-related topics over time and gain insights regarding their diffusion process. PVTM represents documents in a semantic space, which has been shown to capture latent variables of the underlying documents, e.g., the latent topics. Clusters of documents in the semantic space can then be interpreted and transformed into meaningful topics by means of Gaussian mixture modeling. In using PVTM, we identify innovation-related topics from 170, 000 technology news articles published over a span of 20 years and gather insights about their diffusion state by measuring the topic importance in the corpus over time. Our results suggest that PVTM is a credible alternative to widely used topic models for the discovery of latent topics in (technology-related) news articles.

        "abstract": "Ultraslow diffusion is characterized by a logarithmic growth of the mean squared displacement (MSD) as a function of time. It occurs in complex arrangements of molecules, microbes, and many-body systems. This paper reviews mechanical models for ultraslow diffusion in heterogeneous media from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. Macroscopic models are typically formulated in terms of a diffusion equation that employs noninteger order derivatives (distributed order, structural, and comb models (CM)) or employs a diffusion coefficient that is a function of space or time. Microscopic models are usually based on the continuous time random walk (CTRW) theory, but use a weighted logarithmic function as the limiting formula of the waiting time density. The similarities and differences between these models are analyzed and compared with each other. The corresponding MSD in each case is tabulated and discussed from the perspectives of the underlying assumptions and of real-world applications in heterogeneous materials. It is noted that the CMs can be considered as a type of two-dimensional distributed order fractional derivative model (DFDM), and that the structural derivative models (SDMs) generalize the DFDMs. The heterogeneous diffusion process model (HDPM) with time-dependent diffusivity can be rewritten to a local structural derivative diffusion model mathematically. The ergodic properties, aging effect, and velocity autocorrelation for the ultraslow diffusion models are also briefly discussed.",

The classical DQ below 10 000 K are well understood as the result of dredge-up of carbon by the expanding helium convection zone. The high-mass group poses several problems regarding their origin and also an unexpected correlation of effective temperature with mass.Aims.We propose to study the envelopes of these objects to determine the total hydrogen and helium masses as possible clues to their evolution.Methods.We developed new codes for envelope integration and diffusive equilibrium that are adapted to the unusual chemical composition, which is not necessarily dominated by hydrogen and helium.Results.Using the new results for the atmospheric parameters, in particular, the masses obtained usingGaiaparallaxes, we confirm that the narrow sequence of carbon abundances withTeffin the cool classical DQ is indeed caused by an almost constant helium to total mass fraction, as found in earlier studies. This mass fraction is smaller than predicted by stellar evolution calculations. For the warm DQ above 10 000 K, which are thought to originate from double white dwarf mergers, we obtain extremely low hydrogen and helium masses. The correlation of mass withTeffremains unexplained, but another possible correlation of helium layer masses withTeffas well as the gravitational redshifts casts doubt on the reality of both and suggests possible shortcomings of current models.",

        "abstract": "A wide variety of deep generative models has been developed in the past decade. Yet, these models often struggle with simultaneously addressing three key requirements including: high sample quality, mode coverage, and fast sampling. We call the challenge imposed by these requirements the generative learning trilemma, as the existing models often trade some of them for others. Particularly, denoising diffusion models have shown impressive sample quality and diversity, but their expensive sampling does not yet allow them to be applied in many real-world applications. In this paper, we argue that slow sampling in these models is fundamentally attributed to the Gaussian assumption in the denoising step which is justified only for small step sizes. To enable denoising with large steps, and hence, to reduce the total number of denoising steps, we propose to model the denoising distribution using a complex multimodal distribution. We introduce denoising diffusion generative adversarial networks (denoising diffusion GANs) that model each denoising step using a multimodal conditional GAN. Through extensive evaluations, we show that denoising diffusion GANs obtain sample quality and diversity competitive with original diffusion models while being 2000$\\times$ faster on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Compared to traditional GANs, our model exhibits better mode coverage and sample diversity. To the best of our knowledge, denoising diffusion GAN is the first model that reduces sampling cost in diffusion models to an extent that allows them to be applied to real-world applications inexpensively.

Unlike most existing models that learn to deterministically translate a latent vector to a shape, our model, Point-Voxel Diffusion (PVD), is a unified, probabilistic formulation for unconditional shape generation and conditional, multi-modal shape completion. PVD marries denoising diffusion models with the hybrid, point-voxel representation of 3D shapes. It can be viewed as a series of denoising steps, reversing the diffusion process from observed point cloud data to Gaussian noise, and is trained by optimizing a variational lower bound to the (conditional) likelihood function. Experiments demonstrate that PVD is capable of synthesizing high-fidelity shapes, completing partial point clouds, and generating multiple completion results from single-view depth scans of real objects.",

These are processes characterised by a linear growth in time of the mean squared displacement, yet the probability density function of the particle displacement is distinctly non-Gaussian, and often of exponential (Laplace) shape. This apparently ubiquitous behaviour observed in very different physical systems has been interpreted as resulting from diffusion in inhomogeneous environments and mathematically represented through a variable, stochastic diffusion coefficient. Indeed different models describing a fluctuating diffusivity have been studied. Here we present a new view of the stochastic basis describing time-dependent random diffusivities within a broad spectrum of distributions. Concretely, our study is based on the very generic class of the generalised Gamma distribution. Two models for the particle spreading in such random diffusivity settings are studied. The first belongs to the class of generalised grey Brownian motion while the second follows from the idea of diffusing diffusivities. The two processes exhibit significant characteristics which reproduce experimental results from different biological and physical systems. We promote these two physical models for the description of stochastic particle motion in complex environments.",

DiffWave produces high-fidelity audios in Different Waveform generation tasks, including neural vocoding conditioned on mel spectrogram, class-conditional generation, and unconditional generation. We demonstrate that DiffWave matches a strong WaveNet vocoder in terms of speech quality~(MOS: 4.44 versus 4.43), while synthesizing orders of magnitude faster.

        "abstract": "Thermodynamic and kinetic properties are of critical importance for the applicability of computational models to biomolecules such as proteins. Here we present an extensive evaluation of the Amber ff99SB-ILDN force field for modeling of hydration and diffusion of amino acids with three-site (SPC, SPC/E, SPC/Eb, and TIP3P), four-site (TIP4P, TIP4P-Ew, and TIP4P/2005), and five-site (TIP5P and TIP5P-Ew) water models. Hydration free energies (HFEs) of neutral amino acid side chain analogues have little dependence on the water model, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ∼1 kcal/mol from experimental observations. On the basis of the number of interacting sites in the water model, HFEs of charged side chains can be putatively classified into three groups, of which the group of three-site models lies between those of four- and five-site water models; for each group, the water model dependence is greatly eliminated when the solvent Galvani potential is considered. Some discrepancies in the location of the first hydration peak ( RRDF) in the ion-water radial distribution function between experimental and calculated observations were detected, such as a systematic underestimation of the acetate (Asp side chain) ion. The RMSE of calculated diffusion coefficients of amino acids from experiment increases linearly with the increasing diffusion coefficients of the solvent water models at infinite dilution. TIP3P has the fastest diffusivity, in line with literature findings, while the \"FB\" and \"OPC\" water model families as well as TIP4P/2005 perform well, within a relative error of 5%, and TIP4P/2005 yields the most accurate estimate for the water diffusion coefficient. All of the tested water models overestimate amino acid diffusion coefficients by approximately 40% (TIP4P/2005) to 200% (TIP3P). Scaling of protein-water interactions with TIP4P/2005 in the Amber ff99SBws and ff03ws force fields leads to more negative HFEs but has little influence on the diffusion of amino acids. The most recent FF/water combinations of ff14SB/OPC3, ff15ipq/SPC/Eb, and fb15/TIP3P-FB do not show obvious improvements in accuracy for the tested quantities. These findings here establish a benchmark that may aid in the development and improvement of classical force fields to accurately model protein dynamics and thermodynamics.",

        "abstract": "We present the vector quantized diffusion (VQ-Diffusion) model for text-to-image generation. This method is based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) whose latent space is modeled by a conditional variant of the recently developed Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). We find that this latent-space method is well-suited for text-to-image generation tasks because it not only eliminates the unidirectional bias with existing methods but also allows us to incorporate a mask-and-replace diffusion strategy to avoid the accumulation of errors, which is a serious problem with existing methods. Our experiments show that the VQ-Diffusion produces significantly better text-to-image generation results when compared with conventional autoregressive (AR) models with similar numbers of parameters. Compared with previous GAN-based text-to-image methods, our VQ-Diffusion can handle more complex scenes and improve the synthesized image quality by a large margin. Finally, we show that the image generation computation in our method can be made highly efficient by reparameterization. With traditional AR methods, the text-to-image generation time increases linearly with the output image resolution and hence is quite time consuming even for normal size images. The VQ-Diffusion allows us to achieve a better trade-off between quality and speed. Our experiments indicate that the VQ-Diffusion model with the reparameterization is fifteen times faster than traditional AR methods while achieving a better image quality.

        "abstract": "Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved remarkable quality in image generation that rivals GANs'. But unlike GANs, DPMs use a set of latent variables that lack semantic meaning and cannot serve as a useful representation for other tasks. This paper explores the possibility of using DPMs for representation learning and seeks to extract a meaningful and decodable representation of an input image via autoencoding. Our key idea is to use a learnable encoder for discovering the high-level semantics, and a DPM as the decoder for modeling the remaining stochastic variations. Our method can encode any image into a two-part latent code where the first part is semantically meaningful and linear, and the second part captures stochastic details, allowing near-exact reconstruction. This capability enables challenging applications that currently foil GAN-based methods, such as attribute manipulation on real images. We also show that this two-level encoding improves denoising efficiency and naturally facilitates various downstream tasks including few-shot conditional sampling.

To optimize this model, we learn a probabilistic inverse for the argmax that lifts the categorical data to a continuous space.

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with two frequency-dependent susceptible–infected–susceptible epidemic reaction–diffusion models in heterogeneous environment, with a cross-diffusion term modelling the effect that susceptible individuals tend to move away from higher concentration of infected individuals. It is first shown that the corresponding Neumann initial-boundary value problem in an n-dimensional bounded smooth domain possesses a unique global classical solution which is uniformly in-time bounded regardless of the strength of the cross-diffusion and the spatial dimension n. It is further shown that, even in the presence of cross-diffusion, the models still admit threshold-type dynamics in terms of the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal {R}_0$ – i.e. the unique disease-free equilibrium is globally stable if $\\mathcal {R}_0\\lt1$, while if $\\mathcal {R}_0\\gt1$, the disease is uniformly persistent and there is an endemic equilibrium (EE), which is globally stable in some special cases with weak chemotactic sensitivity. Our results on the asymptotic profiles of EE illustrate that restricting the motility of susceptible population may eliminate the infectious disease entirely for the first model with constant total population but fails for the second model with varying total population. In particular, this implies that such cross-diffusion does not contribute to the elimination of the infectious disease modelled by the second one.",

The hierarchical Bayesian approach is used to understand and forecast the growth and geographic spread in the prevalence of chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We compare statistical inference and forecasts from our hierarchical Bayesian model to phenomenological regression-based methods that are commonly used to analyse spatial occurrence data.

        "abstract": "Quantitative models for response time and accuracy are increasingly used as tools to draw conclusions about psychological processes. Here we investigate the extent to which these substantive conclusions depend on whether researchers use the Ratcliff diffusion model or the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model. Simulations show that the models agree on the effects of changes in the rate of information accumulation and changes in non-decision time, but that they disagree on the effects of changes in response caution. In fits to empirical data, however, the models tend to agree closely on the effects of an experimental manipulation of response caution. We discuss the implications of these conflicting results, concluding that real manipulations of caution map closely, but not perfectly to response caution in either model. Importantly, we conclude that inferences about psychological processes made from real data are unlikely to depend on the model that is used.",

We model firms that choose to innovate, adopt technology, or produce with their existing technology. Costly adoption creates a spread between the best and worst technologies concurrently used to produce similar goods. The balance of adoption and innovation determines the shape of the distribution; innovation stretches the distribution, while adoption compresses it. On the balanced growth path, the aggregate growth rate equals the maximum growth rate of innovators. While innovation drives long‐run growth, changes in the adoption environment can influence growth by affecting innovation incentives, either directly, through licensing of excludable technologies, or indirectly, via the option value of adoption.",

        "title": "Robust and Fast Markov Chain Monte Carlo Sampling of Diffusion MRI Microstructure Models",
        "abstract": "In diffusion MRI analysis, advances in biophysical multi-compartment modeling have gained popularity over the conventional Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), because they can obtain a greater specificity in relating the dMRI signal to underlying cellular microstructure. Biophysical multi-compartment models require a parameter estimation, typically performed using either the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Whereas, the MLE provides only a point estimate of the fitted model parameters, the MCMC recovers the entire posterior distribution of the model parameters given in the data, providing additional information such as parameter uncertainty and correlations. MCMC sampling is currently not routinely applied in dMRI microstructure modeling, as it requires adjustment and tuning, specific to each model, particularly in the choice of proposal distributions, burn-in length, thinning, and the number of samples to store. In addition, sampling often takes at least an order of magnitude, more time than non-linear optimization. Here we investigate the performance of the MCMC algorithm variations over multiple popular diffusion microstructure models, to examine whether a single, well performing variation could be applied efficiently and robustly to many models. Using an efficient GPU-based implementation, we showed that run times can be removed as a prohibitive constraint for the sampling of diffusion multi-compartment models. Using this implementation, we investigated the effectiveness of different adaptive MCMC algorithms, burn-in, initialization, and thinning. Finally we applied the theory of the Effective Sample Size, to the diffusion multi-compartment models, as a way of determining a relatively general target for the number of samples needed to characterize parameter distributions for different models and data sets. We conclude that adaptive Metropolis methods increase MCMC performance and select the Adaptive Metropolis-Within-Gibbs (AMWG) algorithm as the primary method. We furthermore advise to initialize the sampling with an MLE point estimate, in which case 100 to 200 samples are sufficient as a burn-in. Finally, we advise against thinning in most use-cases and as a relatively general target for the number of samples, we recommend a multivariate Effective Sample Size of 2,200.",

According to the models, the mean squared displacement of the process is analytically obtained and numerically verified, in particular, the trend of its transition is shown; furthermore the stochastic representation of the process is presented and the positiveness of the PDF of the position of the particles is strictly proved.

Here, we propose a higher-dimensional generalization of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and show that it exhibits a MBL transition. The model on a bipartite lattice has N Majorana fermions with SYK interactions on each site of the A sublattice and M free Majorana fermions on each site of the B sublattice, where N and M are large and finite. For r≡M/N<r_{c}=1, it describes a diffusive metal exhibiting maximal chaos. Remarkably, its diffusive constant D vanishes [D∝(r_{c}-r)^{1/2}] as r→r_{c}, implying a dynamical transition to a MBL phase. It is further supported by numerical calculations of level statistics which changes from Wigner-Dyson (r<r_{c}) to Poisson (r>r_{c}) distributions. Note that no subdiffusive phase intervenes between diffusive and MBL phases. Moreover, the critical exponent ν=0, violating the Harris criterion. Our higher-dimensional SYK model may provide a promising arena to explore exotic MBL transitions.",

Materials and Methods This retrospective institutional review board-approved study received a waiver of informed consent. Two hundred eighty-five patients with PC underwent 3.0-T phased-array coil prostate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including a DK imaging sequence (b values 0, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 sec/mm2) before prostatectomy. Maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and diffusional kurtosis (K) were derived by using maximal b values of 1000 and 2000 sec/mm2, respectively. Mean ADC and K were obtained from volumes of interest (VOIs) placed on each patient's dominant tumor and benign prostate tissue. Metrics were compared between benign and malignant tissue, between Gleason score (GS) ≤ 3 + 3 and GS ≥ 3 + 4 tumors, and between GS ≤ 3 + 4 and GS ≥ 4 + 3 tumors by using paired t tests, analysis of variance, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and exact tests. Results ADC and K showed significant differences for benign versus tumor tissues, GS ≤ 3 + 3 versus GS ≥ 3 + 4 tumors, and GS ≤ 3 + 4 versus GS ≥ 4 + 3 tumors (P < .001 for all). ADC and K were highly correlated (r = -0.82; P < .001). Area under the ROC curve was significantly higher (P = .002) for ADC (0.921) than for K (0.902) for benign versus malignant tissue but was similar for GS ≤ 3 + 3 versus GS ≥ 3 + 4 tumors (0.715-0.744) and GS ≤ 3 + 4 versus GS ≥ 4 + 3 tumors (0.694-0.720) (P > .15). ADC and K were concordant for these various outcomes in 80.0%-88.6% of patients; among patients with discordant results, ADC showed better performance than K for GS ≤ 3 + 4 versus GS ≥ 4 + 3 tumors (P = .016) and was similar to K for other outcomes (P > .136). Conclusion ADC and K were highly correlated, had similar diagnostic performance, and were concordant for the various outcomes in the large majority of cases. These observations did not show a clear added value of DK imaging compared with standard DW imaging for clinical PC evaluation. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "abstract": "Background Perfusion-related intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and non-Gaussian diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) parameters are becoming important biomarkers for differentiating malignant from benign tumors without contrast agents. However, diffusion-time dependence has rarely been investigated in tumors. Purpose To investigate the relationship between diffusion time and diffusion parameters in breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma xenograft mouse models. Material and Methods Diffusion-weighted MR images (DWI) were obtained on a 7-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner at two different diffusion times (9.6 ms and 27.6 ms) in human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5) xenograft mouse models. Perfusion-related IVIM (fIVIM and D*) and non-Gaussian diffusion (ADC0 and K) parameters were estimated. Parametric maps of diffusion changes with the diffusion times were generated using a synthetic apparent diffusion coefficient (sADC) obtained from b = 438 and 2584 s/mm2. Results ADC0 values significantly decreased when diffusion times were changed from 9.6 ms to 27.6 ms in MDA-MB-231, HepG2, and PLC/PRF/5 groups (P = 0.0163, 0.0351, and 0.0170, respectively). K values significantly increased in MDA-MB-231 and HepG2 groups (P < 0.0003 and = 0.0007, respectively); however, no significant difference was detected in the PLC/PRF/5 group. fIVIM values increased, although not significantly (P = 0.164–0.748). The maps of sADC changes showed that diffusion changes with the diffusion time were not homogeneous across tumor tissues. Conclusion Diffusion MR parameters in both breast cancer and HCC xenograft models were found to be diffusion time-dependent. Our results show that diffusion time is an important parameter to consider when interpreting DWI data.",

The diffusion of innovations (DOI) and the integrated model of behavior (IMB) were integrated (i.e., innovation attributes with attitudes and social pressures with norms) to predict participants’ (N = 329) diffusion intentions. The findings showed that positive attitudes about the innovation’s attributes were a consistent positive predictor of diffusion intentions: adopting it, maintaining it, and talking with others about it. As expected by the DOI and the IMB, the social pressure created by a descriptive norm positively predicted intentions to adopt and maintain the innovation. Drawing upon sharing research, we argued that the descriptive norm may dampen future talk about the innovation, because it may no longer be seen as a novel, useful topic to discuss. As predicted, the results showed that as the descriptive norm increased, the intention to talk about the innovation decreased. These results provide broad support for integrating the DOI and the IMB to predict diffusion and for efforts to draw on other research to understand motivations for social diffusion.",

We conclude therefore that the propagation of Galactic CRs has to be strongly anisotropic because of a sufficiently strong regular field and/or of an anisotropy in the turbulent field. As a consequence, the number of sources contributing to the local CR flux is reduced by a factor 𝒪(100) compared to the case of isotropic CR diffusion.",

We show that GDC is closely related to spectral-based models and thus combines the strengths of both spatial (message passing) and spectral methods. We demonstrate that replacing message passing with graph diffusion convolution consistently leads to significant performance improvements across a wide range of models on both supervised and unsupervised tasks and a variety of datasets. Furthermore, GDC is not limited to GNNs but can trivially be combined with any graph-based model or algorithm (e.g. spectral clustering) without requiring any changes to the latter or affecting its computational complexity. Our implementation is available online.",

We investigate the sensitivity of the two parameterizations of the radial diffusion of Brautigam and Albert (2000) and Ozeke et al. (2014) on long‐term radiation belt modeling using the Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB). Following Brautigam and Albert (2000) and Ozeke et al. (2014), we first perform 1‐D radial diffusion simulations. Comparison of the simulation results with observations shows that the difference between simulations with either radial diffusion parameterization is small. To take into account effects of local acceleration and loss, we perform 3‐D simulations, including pitch angle, energy, and mixed diffusion. We found that the results of 3‐D simulations are even less sensitive to the choice of parameterization of radial diffusion rates than the results of 1‐D simulations at various energies (from 0.59 to 1.80 MeV). This result demonstrates that the inclusion of local acceleration and pitch angle diffusion can provide a negative feedback effect, such that the result is largely indistinguishable simulations conducted with different radial diffusion parameterizations. We also perform a number of sensitivity tests by multiplying radial diffusion rates by constant factors and show that such an approach leads to unrealistic predictions of radiation belt dynamics.",

In this paper we show that when 0$ ?>λ′>0 and λ′′=0 the system models the diffusion of carbon in the presence of silicon as in the Darken experiment: the final state of the system is in qualitative agreement with the experimental one and uphill diffusion is present at the weld.

        "abstract": "The properties of dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models, introduced more than a decade ago, are still not entirely known. This paper fills one of the gaps by deriving weak diffusion limits of a modified version of the classical DCC model. The limiting system of stochastic differential equations is characterized by a diffusion matrix of reduced rank. The degeneracy is due to perfect collinearity between the innovations of the volatility and correlation dynamics. For the special case of constant conditional correlations, a nondegenerate diffusion limit can be obtained. Alternative sets of conditions are considered for the rate of convergence of the parameters, obtaining time-varying but deterministic variances and/or correlations. A Monte Carlo experiment confirms that the often used quasi-approximate maximum likelihood (QAML) method to estimate the diffusion parameters is inconsistent for any fixed frequency, but that it may provide reasonable approximations for sufficiently large frequencies and sample sizes.",

        "abstract": "Precise user and item embedding learning is the key to building a successful recommender system. Traditionally, Collaborative Filtering (CF) provides a way to learn user and item embeddings from the user-item interaction history. However, the performance is limited due to the sparseness of user behavior data. With the emergence of online social networks, social recommender systems have been proposed to utilize each user's local neighbors' preferences to alleviate the data sparsity for better user embedding modeling. We argue that, for each user of a social platform, her potential embedding is influenced by her trusted users, with these trusted users are influenced by the trusted users' social connections. As social influence recursively propagates and diffuses in the social network, each user's interests change in the recursive process. Nevertheless, the current social recommendation models simply developed static models by leveraging the local neighbors of each user without simulating the recursive diffusion in the global social network, leading to suboptimal recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a deep influence propagation model to stimulate how users are influenced by the recursive social diffusion process for social recommendation. For each user, the diffusion process starts with an initial embedding that fuses the related features and a free user latent vector that captures the latent behavior preference. The key idea of our proposed model is that we design a layer-wise influence propagation structure to model how users' latent embeddings evolve as the social diffusion process continues. We further show that our proposed model is general and could be applied when the user~(item) attributes or the social network structure is not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model, with more than 13% performance improvements over the best baselines for top-10 recommendation on the two datasets.",

        "abstract": "Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated remarkable synthesis quality. SGMs rely on a diffusion process that gradually perturbs the data towards a tractable distribution, while the generative model learns to denoise. The complexity of this denoising task is, apart from the data distribution itself, uniquely determined by the diffusion process. We argue that current SGMs employ overly simplistic diffusions, leading to unnecessarily complex denoising processes, which limit generative modeling performance. Based on connections to statistical mechanics, we propose a novel critically-damped Langevin diffusion (CLD) and show that CLD-based SGMs achieve superior performance. CLD can be interpreted as running a joint diffusion in an extended space, where the auxiliary variables can be considered “velocities” that are coupled to the data variables as in Hamiltonian dynamics. We derive a novel score matching objective for CLD and show that the model only needs to learn the score function of the conditional distribution of the velocity given data, an easier task than learning scores of the data directly. We also derive a new sampling scheme for efﬁcient synthesis from CLD-based diffusion models. We ﬁnd that CLD outperforms previous SGMs in synthesis quality for similar network architectures and sampling compute budgets. We show that our novel sampler for CLD signiﬁcantly outperforms solvers such as Euler–Maruyama. Our framework provides new insights into score-based denoising diffusion models and can be readily used for high-resolution image synthesis. VPSDE.

        "abstract": "Singing voice synthesis (SVS) systems are built to synthesize high-quality and expressive singing voice, in which the acoustic model generates the acoustic features (e.g., mel-spectrogram) given a music score. Previous singing acoustic models adopt a simple loss (e.g., L1 and L2) or generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct the acoustic features, while they suffer from over-smoothing and unstable training issues respectively, which hinder the naturalness of synthesized singing. \nIn this work, we propose DiffSinger, an acoustic model for SVS based on the diffusion probabilistic model. DiffSinger is a parameterized Markov chain that iteratively converts the noise into mel-spectrogram conditioned on the music score. By implicitly optimizing variational bound, DiffSinger can be stably trained and generate realistic outputs. \nTo further improve the voice quality and speed up inference, we introduce a shallow diffusion mechanism to make better use of the prior knowledge learned by the simple loss. Specifically, DiffSinger starts generation at a shallow step smaller than the total number of diffusion steps, according to the intersection of the diffusion trajectories of the ground-truth mel-spectrogram and the one predicted by a simple mel-spectrogram decoder. Besides, we propose boundary prediction methods to locate the intersection and determine the shallow step adaptively.\nThe evaluations conducted on a Chinese singing dataset demonstrate that DiffSinger outperforms state-of-the-art SVS work.

While previous work has made significant efforts to learn traffic temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models. First, only the neighboring spatial correlations among adjacent regions are considered in most existing methods, and the global interregion dependency is ignored. Additionally, these methods fail to encode the complex traffic transition regularities exhibited with time-dependent and multi-resolution in nature. To tackle these challenges, we develop a new traffic prediction framework–Spatial-Temporal Graph Diffusion Network (ST-GDN). In particular, ST-GDN is a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture which learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies, but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective. Furthermore, a multi-scale attention network is developed to empower ST-GDN with the capability of capturing multi-level temporal dynamics. Experiments on four real-life traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-GDN outperforms different types of state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "Autoregressive models and their sequential factorization of the data likelihood have recently demonstrated great potential for image representation and synthesis. Nevertheless, they incorporate image context in a linear 1D order by attending only to previously synthesized image patches above or to the left. Not only is this unidirectional, sequential bias of attention unnatural for images as it disregards large parts of a scene until synthesis is almost complete. It also processes the entire image on a single scale, thus ignoring more global contextual information up to the gist of the entire scene. As a remedy we incorporate a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of context by combining the autoregressive formulation with a multinomial diffusion process: Whereas a multistage diffusion process successively removes information to coarsen an image, we train a (short) Markov chain to invert this process. In each stage, the resulting autoregressive ImageBART model progressively incorporates context from previous stages in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments show greatly improved image modification capabilities over autoregressive models while also providing high-fidelity image generation, both of which are enabled through efficient training in a compressed latent space. Specifically, our approach can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing. Thus, in contrast to pure autoregressive models, it can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training.",

Early approaches relied on utilizing each user’s first-order social neighbors’ interests for better user modeling, and failed to model the social influence diffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we propose a preliminary work of a neural influence Diffusion Network (i.e., DiffNet) for social recommendation L. Wu, P. Sun, Y. Fu, R. Hong, X. Wang, and M. Wang, “A neural influence diffusion model for social recommendation,” in Proc. Int. ACM SIGIR Conf. Res. Develop. Inf. Retrieval, 2019, pp. 235–244.. DiffNet models the recursive social diffusion process for each user, such that the influence diffusion hidden in the higher-order social network is captured in the user embedding process. Despite the superior performance of DiffNet, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social network and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion process in the social network would neglect the latent collaborative interests of users hidden in the user-item interest network. To this end, in this paper, we propose DiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence diffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the social recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest network as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting both the higher-order user latent interest reflected in the user-item graph and higher-order user influence reflected in the user-user graph for user embedding learning. This is achieved by iteratively aggregating each user’s embedding from three aspects: the user’s previous embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the social network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the user-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention network that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these three aspects. Finally, extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model. We release the source code at https://github.com/PeiJieSun/diffnet.",

However, training a score network well across the entire diffusion time is demanding because the loss scale is significantly imbalanced at each diffusion time. For successful training, therefore, we introduce Soft Truncation, a universally applicable training technique for diffusion models, that softens the fixed and static truncation hyperparameter into a random variable.

It then reviews the evolution of mathematical and computational models that relate the diffusion MR signal to brain tissue microstructure, as well as the expanding areas of application. Next we focus on practicalities of designing a working microstructure imaging technique: model selection, experiment design, parameter estimation, validation, and the pipeline of development of this class of technique. The article concludes with some future perspectives on opportunities in this topic and expectations on how the field will evolve in the short‐to‐medium term.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The sharing economy literature has largely concentrated on the examination of peer-to-peer accommodation platforms such as Airbnb, with little attention paid on other innovations in collaborative consumption. This study investigates consumer adoption of the Uber mobile application through lenses of two theoretical models – Diffusion of Innovation Theory and Technology Acceptance Model. The results suggest that relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, observability, and social influence have a significant influence on both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which in turn lead to subsequent consumer attitudes and adoption intentions. This study demonstrates the integration of the two classic adoption theories.",

An adaptive control is designed without a sign function in which the controller gain matrix is a function of time. The synchronization criteria are established for an error model derived from master–slave models through solving the set of linear matrix inequalities derived by constructing the suitable novel Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional candidate, Green’s formula, and Wirtinger’s inequality. If the proposed sufficient conditions are satisfied, then the global asymptotic synchronization of the error model is guaranteed. The numerical illustrations are provided to demonstrate the validity of the derived synchronization criteria. In addition, the role of system parameters is picturized through the chaotic nature of RDNNs and those unprecedented solutions is utilized to promote better security of image transactions. As is evident, the enhancement of image encryption algorithm is designed with two levels, namely, image watermarking and diffusion process. The contributions of this paper are discussed as concluding remarks.",

The unique property of the reverse process (namely, eliminating non-target signals from the Gaussian noise and noisy signals) could be utilized to restore clean signals. Based on this prop-erty, we propose a diffusion probabilistic model-based speech enhancement (DiffuSE) model that aims to recover clean speech signals from noisy signals. The fundamental architecture of the proposed DiffuSE model is similar to that of DiffWave-a high-quality audio waveform generation model that has a relatively low computational cost and footprint. To attain better enhancement performance, we designed an advanced reverse process, termed the supportive reverse process, which adds noisy speech in each time-step to the predicted speech. The experimental results show that DiffuSE yields performance that is comparable to related audio generative models on the standardized Voice Bank corpus SE task. Moreover, relative to the generally suggested full sam-pling schedule, the proposed supportive reverse process especially improved the fast sampling, taking few steps to yield better enhancement results over the conventional full step inference process.",

However, their denoising process has many steps, making them 2-3 orders of magnitude slower than other generative models such as GANs and VAEs. In this paper, we establish a novel connection between knowledge distillation and image generation with a technique that distills a multi-step denoising process into a single step, resulting in a sampling speed similar to other single-step generative models. Our Denoising Student generates high quality samples comparable to GANs on the CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets, without adversarial training.

        "abstract": "Graph based multi-view clustering has been paid great attention by exploring the neighborhood relationship among data points from multiple views. Though achieving great success in various applications, we observe that most of previous methods learn a consensus graph by building certain data representation models, which at least bears the following drawbacks. First, their clustering performance highly depends on the data representation capability of the model. Second, solving these resultant optimization models usually results in high computational complexity. Third, there are often some hyper-parameters in these models need to tune for obtaining the optimal results. In this work, we propose a general, effective and parameter-free method with convergence guarantee to learn a unified graph for multi-view data clustering via cross-view graph diffusion (CGD), which is the first attempt to employ diffusion process for multi-view clustering. The proposed CGD takes the traditional predefined graph matrices of different views as input, and learns an improved graph for each single view via an iterative cross diffusion process by 1) capturing the underlying manifold geometry structure of original data points, and 2) leveraging the complementary information among multiple graphs. The final unified graph used for clustering is obtained by averaging the improved view associated graphs. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of seven clustering evaluation metrics.",

Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction‐based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint‐based models, reaction‐diffusion models, logical network models, and rule‐based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single‐cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.",

        "abstract": "Score-based (denoising diffusion) generative models have recently gained a lot of success in generating realistic and diverse data. These approaches define a forward diffusion process for transforming data to noise and generate data by reversing it (thereby going from noise to data). Unfortunately, current score-based models generate data very slowly due to the sheer number of score network evaluations required by numerical SDE solvers. In this work, we aim to accelerate this process by devising a more efficient SDE solver. Existing approaches rely on the Euler-Maruyama (EM) solver, which uses a fixed step size. We found that naively replacing it with other SDE solvers fares poorly - they either result in low-quality samples or become slower than EM. To get around this issue, we carefully devise an SDE solver with adaptive step sizes tailored to score-based generative models piece by piece. Our solver requires only two score function evaluations, rarely rejects samples, and leads to high-quality samples. Our approach generates data 2 to 10 times faster than EM while achieving better or equal sample quality. For high-resolution images, our method leads to significantly higher quality samples than all other methods tested. Our SDE solver has the benefit of requiring no step size tuning.",

Traditional approaches either heavily depend on underlying diffusion models and are not optimized for popularity prediction, or use complicated hand-crafted features that cannot be easily generalized to different types of cascades. Recent generative approaches allow for understanding the spreading mechanisms, but with unsatisfactory prediction accuracy. To capture both the underlying structures governing the spread of information and inherent dependencies between re-tweeting behaviors of users, we propose a semi-supervised method, called Recurrent Cascades Convolutional Networks (CasCN), which explicitly models and predicts cascades through learning the latent representation of both structural and temporal information, without involving any other features. In contrast to the existing single, undirected and stationary Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), CasCN is a novel multi-directional/dynamic GCN. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that CasCN significantly improves the prediction accuracy and reduces the computational cost compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",

Advanced diffusion models provide additional microstructural information. Purpose To compare the diagnostic performance of histogram features of multiple diffusion metrics in predicting glioma IDH and 1p/19q genotyping. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, participants were enrolled from December 2018 to December 2020. Diffusion-weighted imaging was performed by using a spin-echo echo-planar imaging sequence with five b values (500, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500 sec/mm2) in 30 directions for every b value and one b value of 0. Diffusion metrics of diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion-kurtosis imaging (DKI), neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), and mean apparent propagator (MAP) were calculated, and their histogram features were analyzed in regions that included the entire tumor and peritumoral edema. Comparisons between groups were performed according to IDH genotype and 1p/19q codeletion status. Logistic regression analysis was used to predict the IDH and 1p/19q genotypes. Results A total of 215 participants (115 men, 100 women; mean age, 48 years ± 13 [standard deviation]) with grade II (n = 68), grade III (n = 35), and grade IV (n = 112) glioma were included. Among the DTI, DKI, NODDI, MAP, and total diffusion models, there were no significant differences in the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) for predicting IDH mutations (AUC, 0.76, 0.82, 0.78, 0.81, and 0.82, respectively; P > .05) and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas with IDH mutations (AUC, 0.83, 0.81, 0.82, 0.83, and 0.88, respectively; P > .05). A regression model with an R2 value of 0.84 was used for the Ki-67 labeling index and histogram features of the diffusion metrics. Conclusion Whole-tumor histogram analysis of multiple diffusion metrics is a promising approach for glioma isocitrate dehydrogenase and 1p/19q genotyping, and the performance of diffusion-tensor imaging is similar to that of advanced diffusion models.

These applications are propelled by the rapid development of novel diffusion models to extract biologically valuable information from diffusion‐weighted MR signals, and significant advances in MR hardware that has enabled image acquisition with high b‐values. This article reviews recent technical developments and clinical applications in cancer imaging using DWI, with a special emphasis on high b‐value diffusion models. The article is organized in four sections. First, we provide an overview of diffusion models that are relevant to cancer imaging. The model parameters are discussed in relation to three tissue properties—cellularity, vascularity, and microstructures. An emphasis is placed on characterization of microstructural heterogeneity, given its novelty and close relevance to cancer. Second, we illustrate diffusion MR clinical applications in each of the following three categories: 1) cancer detection and diagnosis; 2) cancer grading, staging, and classification; and 3) cancer treatment response prediction and evaluation. Third, we discuss several practical issues, including selection of image acquisition parameters, reproducibility and reliability, motion management, image distortion, etc., that are commonly encountered when applying DWI to cancer in clinical settings. Lastly, we highlight a few ongoing challenges and provide some possible future directions, particularly in the area of establishing standards via well‐organized multicenter clinical trials to accelerate clinical translation of advanced DWI techniques to improving cancer care on a large scale.",

        "title": "Learning Spatio-Temporal Representation With Local and Global Diffusion",
        "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been regarded as a powerful class of models for visual recognition problems. Nevertheless, the convolutional filters in these networks are local operations while ignoring the large-range dependency. Such drawback becomes even worse particularly for video recognition, since video is an information-intensive media with complex temporal variations. In this paper, we present a novel framework to boost the spatio-temporal representation learning by Local and Global Diffusion (LGD). Specifically, we construct a novel neural network architecture that learns the local and global representations in parallel. The architecture is composed of LGD blocks, where each block updates local and global features by modeling the diffusions between these two representations. Diffusions effectively interact two aspects of information, i.e., localized and holistic, for more powerful way of representation learning. Furthermore, a kernelized classifier is introduced to combine the representations from two aspects for video recognition. Our LGD networks achieve clear improvements on the large-scale Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600 video classification datasets against the best competitors by 3.5% and 0.7%. We further examine the generalization of both the global and local representations produced by our pre-trained LGD networks on four different benchmarks for video action recognition and spatio-temporal action detection tasks. Superior performances over several state-of-the-art techniques on these benchmarks are reported.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) measurements and models provide information about brain connectivity and are sensitive to the physical properties of tissue microstructure. Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) quantifies the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion in biological tissue from dMRI. These estimates are of interest because they were shown to be more sensitive to microstructural alterations in health and diseases than measures based on the total anisotropy of diffusion which are highly confounded by tissue dispersion and fiber crossings. In this work, we implemented DKI in the Diffusion in Python (DIPY) project - a large collaborative open-source project which aims to provide well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive implementation of different dMRI techniques. We demonstrate the functionality of our methods in numerical simulations with known ground truth parameters and in openly available datasets. A particular strength of our DKI implementations is that it pursues several extensions of the model that connect it explicitly with microstructural models and the reconstruction of 3D white matter fiber bundles (tractography). For instance, our implementations include DKI-based microstructural models that allow the estimation of biophysical parameters, such as axonal water fraction. Moreover, we illustrate how DKI provides more general characterization of non-Gaussian diffusion compatible with complex white matter fiber architectures and grey matter, and we include a novel mean kurtosis index that is invariant to the confounding effects due to tissue dispersion. In summary, DKI in DIPY provides a well-tested, well-documented and comprehensive reference mplementation for DKI. It provides a platform for wider use of DKI in research on brain disorders and cognitive neuroscience research. It will ease the translation of DKI advantages into clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "The study of information diffusion or cascade has attracted much attention over the last decade. Most related works target on studying cascade-level macroscopic properties such as the final size of a cascade. Existing microscopic cascade models which focus on user-level modeling either make strong assumptions on how a user gets infected by a cascade or limit themselves to a specific scenario where “who infected whom” information is explicitly labeled. The strong assumptions oversimplify the complex diffusion mechanism and prevent these models from better fitting real-world cascade data. Also, the methods which focus on specific scenarios cannot be generalized to a general setting where the diffusion graph is unobserved. To overcome the drawbacks of previous works, we propose a Neural Diffusion Model (NDM) for general microscopic cascade study. NDM makes relaxed assumptions and employs deep learning techniques including attention mechanism and convolutional network for cascade modeling. Both advantages enable our model to go beyond the limitations of previous methods, better fit the diffusion data and generalize to unseen cascades. Experimental results on diffusion identification task over four realistic cascade datasets show that our model can achieve a relative improvement up to 26 percent against the best performing baseline in terms of F1 score.",

Training such models relies on denoising score matching, which can be seen as multi-scale denoising autoencoders. Here, we augment the denoising score matching framework to enable representation learning without any supervised signal. GANs and VAEs learn representations by directly transforming latent codes to data samples. In contrast, the introduced diffusion-based representation learning relies on a new formulation of the denoising score matching objective and thus encodes the information needed for denoising. We illustrate how this difference allows for manual control of the level of details encoded in the representation. Using the same approach, we propose to learn an infinite-dimensional latent code that achieves improvements of state-of-the-art models on semi-supervised image classification. We also compare the quality of learned representations of diffusion score matching with other methods like autoencoder and contrastively trained systems through their performances on downstream tasks.",

        "abstract": "The integration of Vector Quantised Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) with autoregressive models as generation part has yielded high-quality results on image generation. However, the autoregressive models will strictly follow the progressive scanning order during the sampling phase. This leads the existing VQ series models to hardly escape the trap of lacking global information. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) in the continuous domain have shown a capability to capture the global context, while generating high-quality images. In the discrete state space, some works have demonstrated the potential to perform text generation and low resolution image generation. We show that with the help of a content-rich discrete visual codebook from VQ-VAE, the discrete diffusion model can also generate high fidelity images with global context, which compensates for the deficiency of the classical autoregressive model along pixel space. Meanwhile, the integration of the discrete VAE with the diffusion model resolves the drawback of conventional autoregressive models being oversized, and the diffusion model which demands excessive time in the sampling process when generating images. It is found that the quality of the generated images is heavily dependent on the discrete visual codebook. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Vector Quantised Discrete Diffusion Model (VQ-DDM) is able to achieve comparable performance to top-tier methods with low complexity. It also demonstrates outstanding advantages over other vectors quantised with autoregressive models in terms of image inpainting tasks without additional training.",

We study the passive, thermally driven motion of micron-sized tracers in hydrogels of mucins, the main polymeric component of mucus. We report the results of the Bayesian analysis for ranking several diffusion models for a set of tracer trajectories [C. E. Wagner et al., Biomacromolecules, 2017, 18, 3654]. The models with \"diffusing diffusivity\", fractional and standard Brownian motion are used. The likelihood functions and evidences of each model are computed, ranking the significance of each model for individual traces. We find that viscoelastic anomalous diffusion is often most probable, followed by Brownian motion, while the model with a diffusing diffusion coefficient is only realised rarely. Our analysis also clarifies the distribution of time-averaged displacements, correlations of scaling exponents and diffusion coefficients, and the degree of non-Gaussianity of displacements at varying pH levels. Weak ergodicity breaking is also quantified. We conclude that-consistent with the original study-diffusion of tracers in the mucin gels is most non-Gaussian and non-ergodic at low pH that corresponds to the most heterogeneous networks. Using the Bayesian approach with the nested-sampling algorithm, together with the quantitative analysis of multiple statistical measures, we report new insights into possible physical mechanisms of diffusion in mucin gels.",

We therefore developed and validated a radiomics model using multiparametric MRI to differentiate pseudoprogression from early tumor progression in patients with glioblastoma.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe model was developed from the enlarging contrast-enhancing portions of 61 glioblastomas within 3 months after standard treatment with 6472 radiomic features being obtained from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps. Imaging features were selected using a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) logistic regression model with 10-fold cross-validation. Diagnostic performance for pseudoprogression was compared with that for single parameters (mean and minimum ADC and mean and maximum CBV) and single imaging radiomics models using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The model was validated with an external cohort (n = 34) imaged on a different scanner and internal prospective registry data (n = 23).\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwelve significant radiomic features (3 from conventional, 2 from diffusion, and 7 from perfusion MRI) were selected for model construction. The multiparametric radiomics model (AUC, 0.90) showed significantly better performance than any single ADC or CBV parameter (AUC, 0.57-0.79, P < 0.05), and better than a single radiomics model using conventional MRI (AUC, 0.76, P = 0.012), ADC (AUC, 0.78, P = 0.014), or CBV (AUC, 0.80, P = 0.43).

Recently, deep learning (DL) has been widely used in tumor diagnosis and treatment and has produced exciting results. Purpose To develop and validate a DL method to predict response of rectal cancer to neoadjuvant therapy based on diffusion kurtosis and T2-weighted MRI. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, participants with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (≥cT3 or N+) proved at histopathology and baseline MRI who were scheduled to undergo preoperative chemoradiotherapy were enrolled from October 2015 to December 2017 and were chronologically divided into 308 training samples and 104 test samples. DL models were constructed primarily to predict pathologic complete response (pCR) and secondarily to assess tumor regression grade (TRG) (TRG0 and TRG1 vs TRG2 and TRG3) and T downstaging. Other analysis included comparisons of diffusion kurtosis MRI parameters and subjective evaluation by radiologists. Results A total of 383 participants (mean age, 57 years ± 10 [standard deviation]; 229 men) were evaluated (290 in the training cohort, 93 in the test cohort). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.99 for the pCR model in the test cohort, which was higher than the AUC for raters 1 and 2 (0.66 and 0.72, respectively; P < .001 for both). AUC for the DL model was 0.70 for TRG and 0.79 for T downstaging. AUC for pCR with the DL model was better than AUC for the best-performing diffusion kurtosis MRI parameters alone (diffusion coefficient in normal diffusion after correcting the non-Gaussian effect [Dapp value] before neoadjuvant therapy, AUC = 0.76). Subjective evaluation by radiologists yielded a higher error rate (1 - accuracy) (25 of 93 [26.9%] and 23 of 93 [24.8%] for raters 1 and 2, respectively) in predicting pCR than did evaluation with the DL model (two of 93 [2.2%]); the radiologists achieved a lower error rate (12 of 93 [12.9%] and 13 of 93 [14.0%] for raters 1 and 2, respectively) when assisted by the DL model.

We give exact expressions for the diffusion coefficients. Our results apply to a large class of integrable models, including quantum and classical, Galilean and relativistic field theories, chains, and gases in one dimension, such as the Lieb-Liniger model describing cold atom gases and the Heisenberg quantum spin chain.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT A systematic study of the diffusion mechanism and effect of mass transfer limitation during the adsorption of CO2 onto polyaspartamide is presented using a differential adsorption bed method, carried out in a 100 × 60 × 40 mm packed-bed adsorption unit. The rate-limiting step where mass transfer limitation is dominant was studied using diffusion models. It was observed that intraparticle diffusion mechanism is the major contributor to the resistance offered to the transport of gas molecule through polyaspartamide. The behaviour of polyaspartamide, based on the intraparticle diffusion rate parameter derived from the plots of CO2 adsorbed versus the square root of time, signified that the adsorption mechanism involved both film and intraparticle diffusion. The intraparticle diffusion parameter (kid) obtained was dependent on temperature as well as intraparticle convection effects and ranged from 1.24 × 10−4 to 2.13 × 10−4 ms−1. The Biot number (Bi) values were all greater than 10 (ranged from 17.80 – 30.74), confirming that the intraparticle diffusion was the rate-limiting step and heat transfer is more by conduction from the gas film layer than convection within the pores of polyaspartamide. Results from this study provide an important basis for future scale-up and optimisation of CO2 capture process using polyaspartamide.",

In these models, operators spread through the ballistic propagation of quasiparticles, with an operator front whose velocity is locally set by the fastest quasiparticle velocity. In interacting integrable systems, this velocity depends on the density of the other quasiparticles, so equilibrium density fluctuations cause the front to follow a biased random walk, and therefore to broaden diffusively. Ballistic front propagation and diffusive front broadening are also generically present in nonintegrable systems in one dimension; thus, although the mechanisms for operator spreading are distinct in the two cases, these coarse-grained measures of the operator front do not distinguish between the two cases. We present an expression for the front-broadening rate; we explicitly derive this for a particular integrable model (the ``Floquet-Fredrickson-Andersen'' model), and argue on kinetic grounds that it should apply generally. Our results elucidate the microscopic mechanism for diffusive corrections to ballistic transport in interacting integrable models.",

        "abstract": "We put forward a new approach to studying issue definition within the context of policy diffusion. Most studies of policy diffusion—which is the process by which policymaking in one government affects policymaking in other governments—have focused on policy adoptions. We shift the focus to an important but neglected aspect of this process: the issue-definition stage. We use topic models to estimate how policies are framed during this stage and how these frames are predicted by prior policy adoptions. Focusing on smoking restriction in U.S. states, our analysis draws upon an original dataset of over 52,000 paragraphs from newspapers covering 49 states between 1996 and 2013. We find that frames regarding the policy’s concrete implications are predicted by prior adoptions in other states, while frames regarding its normative justifications are not. Our approach and findings open the way for a new perspective to studying policy diffusion in many different areas.

        "abstract": "Singing voice synthesis (SVS) system is built to synthesize high-quality and expressive singing voice, in which the acoustic model generates the acoustic features ( e . g ., mel-spectrogram) given a music score. Previous singing acoustic models adopt simple loss ( e . g ., L1 and L2) or generative adversarial network (GAN) to reconstruct the acoustic features, while they suffer from over-smoothing and unstable training issues respectively, which hinder the naturalness of synthesized singing. In this work, we propose DiffSinger, an acoustic model for SVS based on the diffusion probabilistic model. DiffSinger is a parameterized Markov chain which iteratively converts the noise into mel-spectrogram conditioned on the music score. By implicitly optimizing variational bound, DiffSinger can be stably trained and generates realistic outputs. To further improve the voice quality, we introduce a shallow diffusion mechanism to make better use of the prior knowledge learned by the simple loss. Speciﬁcally, Diff-Singer starts generation at a shallow step smaller than the total number of diffusion steps, according to the intersection of the diffusion trajectories of the ground-truth mel-spectrogram and the one predicted by a simple mel-spectrogram decoder. Besides, we train a boundary prediction network to locate the intersection and determine the shallow step adaptively. The evaluations conducted on the Chinese singing dataset demonstrate that DiffSinger outperforms state-of-the-art SVS work with a notable margin (0.11 MOS gains). Our extensional experiments also prove the generalization of DiffSinger on text-to-speech task.",

The self-diffusion coefficient is directly associated with the calculations of tracer or mutual diffusion coefficient of mixtures and, therefore, is a fundamental transport property, essential for an accurate description of mass transfer processes in biological, geological (i.e. energy or environmentally related), and chemical systems. In the current review we explore two distinct research areas. Namely, we discuss the self-diffusion of water in the bulk phase and under confinement. Different aspects that affect the diffusion process, including the molecular models, the system-size effects, the temperature and pressure conditions and the type of confinement are discussed.

        "abstract": "Abstract Underlying higher order chromatin organization are Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes, large protein rings that entrap DNA. The molecular mechanism by which SMC complexes organize chromatin is as yet incompletely understood. Two prominent models posit that SMC complexes actively extrude DNA loops (loop extrusion), or that they sequentially entrap two DNAs that come into proximity by Brownian motion (diffusion capture). To explore the implications of these two mechanisms, we perform biophysical simulations of a 3.76 Mb-long chromatin chain, the size of the long Schizosaccharomyces pombe chromosome I left arm. On it, the SMC complex condensin is modeled to perform loop extrusion or diffusion capture. We then compare computational to experimental observations of mitotic chromosome formation. Both loop extrusion and diffusion capture can result in native-like contact probability distributions. In addition, the diffusion capture model more readily recapitulates mitotic chromosome axis shortening and chromatin compaction. Diffusion capture can also explain why mitotic chromatin shows reduced, as well as more anisotropic, movements, features that lack support from loop extrusion. The condensin distribution within mitotic chromosomes, visualized by stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), shows clustering predicted from diffusion capture. Our results inform the evaluation of current models of mitotic chromosome formation.",

Chemical analysis of the LGM50 cell shows that it is comprised of a NMC 811 positive electrode and bi-component Graphite-SiOx negative electrode.

Apparent diffusion coefficients are estimated using the Sand equation on the voltage transient during the current pulse; an expansion factor was applied to the bi-component negative electrode data to reflect the average change in effective surface area during lithiation. The 35 parameters are applied within a P2D model to show the fit to experimental validation LGM50 cell discharge and relaxation voltage profiles at room temperature.

Understanding variation in allele frequencies across populations is a central goal of population genetics. Classical models for the distribution of allele frequencies, using forward simulation, coalescent theory, or the diffusion approximation, have been applied extensively for demographic inference, medical study design, and evolutionary studies. Here we propose a tractable model of ordinary differential equations for the evolution of allele frequencies that is closely related to the diffusion approximation but avoids many of its limitations and approximations. We show that the approach is typically faster, more numerically stable, and more easily generalizable than the state-of-the-art software implementation of the diffusion approximation. We present a number of applications to human sequence data, including demographic inference with a five-population joint frequency spectrum and a discussion of the robustness of the out-of-Africa model inference to the choice of modern population.",

This exponent had previously been observed in large-scale numerical simulations, but had not been theoretically explained. We briefly discuss XXZ models with easy-axis anisotropy Δ>1. Our method gives closed-form expressions for the diffusion constant D in the infinite-temperature limit for all Δ>1.

        "abstract": "Unsupervised video object segmentation has often been tackled by methods based on recurrent neural networks and optical flow. Despite their complexity, these kinds of approach tend to favour short-term temporal dependencies and are thus prone to accumulating inaccuracies, which cause drift over time. Moreover, simple (static) image segmentation models, alone, can perform competitively against these methods, which further suggests that the way temporal dependencies are modelled should be reconsidered. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we explore simple yet effective strategies to model long-term temporal dependencies. Inspired by the non-local operators, we introduce a technique to establish dense correspondences between pixel embeddings of a reference \"anchor\" frame and the current one. This allows the learning of pairwise dependencies at arbitrarily long distances without conditioning on intermediate frames. Without online supervision, our approach can suppress the background and precisely segment the foreground object even in challenging scenarios, while maintaining consistent performance over time. With a mean IoU of 81.7%, our method ranks first on the DAVIS-2016 leaderboard of unsupervised methods, while still being competitive against state-of-the-art online semi-supervised approaches. We further evaluate our method on the FBMS dataset and the video saliency dataset ViSal, showing results competitive with the state of the art.",

Consequently, the study assesses the determinants of the diffusion of FinTech Payment Services (mobile money, card, and online payments) by SMEs in the context of Ghana. We sample 407 registered SMEs with the Association of Ghanaian Industries (AGI) and employ hierarchical logistic regression models to explore the multiplicative effects of SMEs Chief Executive Officers Characteristics (CEOC), Business Characteristics (BUSC), and FinTech Payment Service Characteristics (FPSC) on the Diffusion of FinTech Payment Services (DFPS). Consistent with the technology diffusion theories, the finding reveals that CEOC, BUSC, and FPSC altogether determines the DFPS in Ghanaian SMEs. Thus, the combined effects of human, business, and technology actors drive the DFPS in SMEs. Therefore, the optimal design of FinTech services is critical for mass diffusion by SMEs in emerging economies.",

        "abstract": "Several previous studies reported relationships between speed of information processing as measured with the drift parameter of the diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) and general intelligence. Most of these studies utilized only few tasks and none of them used more complex tasks. In contrast, our study (N = 125) was based on a large battery of 18 different response time tasks that varied both in content (numeric, figural, and verbal) and complexity (fast tasks with mean RTs of ca. 600 ms vs. more complex tasks with mean RTs of ca. 3,000 ms). Structural equation models indicated a strong relationship between a domain-general drift factor and general intelligence. Beyond that, domain-specific speed of information processing factors were closely related to the respective domain scores of the intelligence test. Furthermore, speed of information processing in the more complex tasks explained additional variance in general intelligence. In addition to these theoretically relevant findings, our study also makes methodological contributions showing that there are meaningful interindividual differences in content specific drift rates and that not only fast tasks, but also more complex tasks can be modeled with the diffusion model.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In recent years, the regeneration technology of aged asphalt in construction engineering has received much attention. The diffusion performance of the rejuvenator is a key factor in this kind of regeneration technology. But at present, the relevant research is still not mature. To forward this research, this study established molecular dynamic models of three diffusion systems with the open source large-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator, including new asphalt, short-term aged asphalt and long-term aged asphalt. This study then analysed the diffusion mechanism and influence factors including temperature, ageing and the diffusion laws of different kinds of molecules. It was found that besides thermal motion, molecular force also greatly contributes to the diffusion of asphalt and rejuvenator. It was also found that micro voids in asphalt increase the contact area and promote the fusion of the rejuvenator and asphalt. Diffusion speed increases as temperature rises, and diffusion speed in aged asphalt is higher than that in new asphalt, especially at higher temperatures. The simulation results also suggest that small or catenarian molecules diffuse faster than the network structures.",

Spatial patterns revealed by epidemic models governed by reaction-diffusion systems can serve as a potential trend indicator of disease spread; thus, they have received wide attention. To characterize important features of disease spread, there are two important factors that cannot be ignored in the reaction-diffusion systems. One is that a susceptible individual has an ability to recognize the infected ones and keep away from them. The other is that populations are usually organized as networks instead of being continuously distributed in space. Consequently, it is essential to study patterns generated by epidemic models with self- and cross-diffusion on complex networks. Here, with the help of a linear analysis method, we study Turing instability induced by cross-diffusion for a network organized SIR epidemic model and explore Turing patterns on several different networks. Furthermore, the influences of cross-diffusion and network structure on patterns are also investigated.",

        "abstract": "Hard carbons are among the most promising materials for alkali‐ion metal anodes. These materials have a highly complex structure and understanding the metal storage and migration within these structures is of utmost importance for the development of next‐generation battery technologies. The effect of different carbon structural motifs on Li, Na, and K storage and diffusion are probed using density functional theory based on experimental characterizations of hard carbon samples. Two carbon structural models—the planar graphitic layer model and the cylindrical pore model—are constructed guided by small‐angle X‐ray scattering and transmission electron microscopy characterization. The planar graphitic layers with interlayer distance <6.5 Å are beneficial for metal storage, but do not have significant contribution to rapid metal diffusion. Fast diffusion is shown to take place in planar graphitic layers with interlayer distance >6.5 Å, when the graphitic layer separation becomes so wide that there is negligible interaction between the two graphitic layers. The cylindrical pore model, reflecting the curved morphology, does not increase metal storage, but significantly lowers the metal migration barriers. Hence, the curved carbon morphologies are shown to have great importance for battery cycling. These findings provide an atomic‐scale picture of the metal storage and diffusion in these materials.",

Efficient traffic management relies on the accurate and prompt acquisition as well as diffusion of traffic information. To achieve this, research is mostly focused on optimizing the mobility models and communication performance. However, considering the escalating scale of IoV networks, the interconnection of heterogeneous smart vehicles plays a critical role in enhancing the efficiency of traffic information collection and diffusion. In this paper, we commence by establishing a weighted and undirected graph model for IoV sensing networks and verify its time-invariant complex characteristics relying on a real-world taxi GPS dataset. Moreover, we propose an IoV-aided local traffic information collection architecture, a sink node selection scheme for the information influx, and an optimal traffic information transmission model.

        "abstract": "Modern societies are exposed to a myriad of risks ranging from disease to natural hazards and technological disruptions. Exploring how the awareness of risk spreads and how it triggers a diffusion of coping strategies is prominent in the research agenda of various domains. It requires a deep understanding of how individuals perceive risks and communicate about the effectiveness of protective measures, highlighting learning and social interaction as the core mechanisms driving such processes. Methodological approaches that range from purely physics-based diffusion models to data-driven environmental methods rely on agent-based modeling to accommodate context-dependent learning and social interactions in a diffusion process. Mixing agent-based modeling with data-driven machine learning has become popularity. However, little attention has been paid to the role of intelligent learning in risk appraisal and protective decisions, whether used in an individual or a collective process. The differences between collective learning and individual learning have not been sufficiently explored in diffusion modeling in general and in agent-based models of socio-environmental systems in particular. To address this research gap, we explored the implications of intelligent learning on the gradient from individual to collective learning, using an agent-based model enhanced by machine learning. Our simulation experiments showed that individual intelligent judgement about risks and the selection of coping strategies by groups with majority votes were outperformed by leader-based groups and even individuals deciding alone. Social interactions appeared essential for both individual learning and group learning. The choice of how to represent social learning in an agent-based model could be driven by existing cultural and social norms prevalent in a modeled society.",

        "title": "Dopaminergic Modulation of Human Intertemporal Choice: A Diffusion Model Analysis Using the D2-Receptor Antagonist Haloperidol",
        "abstract": "The neurotransmitter dopamine is implicated in diverse functions, including reward processing, reinforcement learning, and cognitive control. The tendency to discount future rewards over time has long been discussed in the context of potential dopaminergic modulation. Here we examined the effect of a single dose of the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (2 mg) on temporal discounting in healthy female and male human participants. Our approach extends previous pharmacological studies in two ways. First, we applied combined temporal discounting drift diffusion models to examine choice dynamics. Second, we examined dopaminergic modulation of reward magnitude effects on temporal discounting. Hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation revealed that the data were best accounted for by a temporal discounting drift diffusion model with nonlinear trialwise drift rate scaling. This model showed good parameter recovery, and posterior predictive checks revealed that it accurately reproduced the relationship between decision conflict and response times in individual participants. We observed reduced temporal discounting and substantially faster nondecision times under haloperidol compared with placebo. Discounting was steeper for low versus high reward magnitudes, but this effect was largely unaffected by haloperidol. Results were corroborated by model-free analyses and modeling via more standard approaches. We previously reported elevated caudate activation under haloperidol in this sample of participants, supporting the idea that haloperidol elevated dopamine neurotransmission (e.g., by blocking inhibitory feedback via presynaptic D2 auto-receptors). The present results reveal that this is associated with an augmentation of both lower-level (nondecision time) and higher-level (temporal discounting) components of the decision process. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Dopamine is implicated in reward processing, reinforcement learning, and cognitive control. Here we examined the effects of a single dose of the D2 receptor antagonist haloperidol on temporal discounting and choice dynamics during the decision process. We extend previous studies by applying computational modeling using the drift diffusion model, which revealed that haloperidol reduced the nondecision time and reduced impulsive choice compared with placebo. These findings are compatible with a haloperidol-induced increase in striatal dopamine (e.g., because of a presynaptic mechanism). Our data provide novel insights into the contributions of dopamine to value-based decision-making and highlight how comprehensive model-based analyses using sequential sampling models can inform the effects of pharmacological modulation on choice processes.",

We propose an alternative explanation we call associative diffusion. Drawing on two insights from research in cognition—that meaning inheres in cognitive associations between concepts, and that perceived associations constrain people’s actions—we introduce a model in which, rather than beliefs or behaviors, the things being transmitted between individuals are perceptions about what beliefs or behaviors are compatible with one another. Conventional contagion models require the assumption that networks are segregated to explain cultural variation. We show, in contrast, that the endogenous emergence of cultural differentiation can be entirely attributable to social cognition and does not require a segregated network or a preexisting division into groups. Moreover, we show that prevailing assumptions about the effects of network topology do not hold when diffusion is associative.",

We prove that this nonlocal model is well-posed, and its long-time dynamical behaviour is characterised by a spreading-vanishing dichotomy. We also find the criteria that completely determine when spreading and vanishing can happen, revealing some significant differences from the model in Lin and Zhu (2017 J. Math. Biol. 75 1381–1409). It is expected that the nonlocal model here may exhibit accelerated spreading (see remark part (c)), a feature contrasting sharply to the corresponding local diffusion model, which has been shown by Wang et al (2019 J.

        "abstract": "Significance Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most prominent toxic compounds in the air. Heterogeneous reactions involving O3 can change the toxicity of PAHs, but the reaction mechanism and kinetics remain to be elucidated. Based on new experiments combined with state-of-the-art kinetic and thermodynamic models, we show that phase separation plays a critical role in the ozonolysis of PAHs mixed with secondary organic aerosols and organic oils. Ozonolysis products of PAHs phase separate to form viscous surface crusts, which protect underlying PAHs from ozonolysis to prolong their chemical lifetime. These results have significant implications for outdoor and indoor air quality by affecting PAH long-range transport and fate in indoor environments. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a key polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) often associated with soot particles coated by organic compounds, is a known carcinogen and mutagen. When mixed with organics, the kinetics and mechanisms of chemical transformations of BaP by ozone in indoor and outdoor environments are still not fully elucidated. Using direct analysis in real-time mass spectrometry (DART-MS), kinetics studies of the ozonolysis of BaP in thin films exhibited fast initial loss of BaP followed by a slower decay at long exposure times. Kinetic multilayer modeling demonstrates that the slow decay of BaP over long times can be simulated if there is slow diffusion of BaP from the film interior to the surface, resolving long-standing unresolved observations of incomplete PAH decay upon prolonged ozone exposure. Phase separation drives the slow diffusion time scales in multicomponent systems. Specifically, thermodynamic modeling predicts that BaP phase separates from secondary organic aerosol material so that the BaP-rich layer at the surface shields the inner BaP from ozone. Also, BaP is miscible with organic oils such as squalane, linoleic acid, and cooking oil, but its oxidation products are virtually immiscible, resulting in the formation of a viscous surface crust that hinders diffusion of BaP from the film interior to the surface. These findings imply that phase separation and slow diffusion significantly prolong the chemical lifetime of PAHs, affecting long-range transport of PAHs in the atmosphere and their fates in indoor environments.",

In these models, a large production of PBHs requires a deviation from the slow-roll (SR) trajectory. In turn, this SR violation can produce an exponential growth of quantum fluctuations. We study the back-reaction of these quantum modes on the inflationary dynamics using stochastic inflation in the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We develop a methodology to solve quantum diffusion beyond SR in terms of the statistical moments of the probability distribution. We apply these techniques to a toy model potential with a quasi-inflection point. We find that there is an enhancement of the power spectrum due to the dominance of the stochastic noise in the phase beyond SR. Moreover, non-Gaussian corrections become as well relevant with a large positive kurtosis. Altogether, this produces a significant boost of PBH production. We discuss how our results extend to other single-field models with similar dynamics. We conclude that the abundance of PBHs in this class of models should be revisited including quantum diffusion.",

        "abstract": "In vivo mapping of the neurite density with diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a high but challenging aim. First, it is unknown whether all neurites exhibit completely anisotropic (“stick‐like”) diffusion. Second, the “density” of tissue components may be confounded by non‐diffusion properties such as T2 relaxation. Third, the domain of validity for the estimated parameters to serve as indices of neurite density is incompletely explored. We investigated these challenges by acquiring data with “b‐tensor encoding” and multiple echo times in brain regions with low orientation coherence and in white matter lesions. Results showed that microscopic anisotropy from b‐tensor data is associated with myelinated axons but not with dendrites. Furthermore, b‐tensor data together with data acquired for multiple echo times showed that unbiased density estimates in white matter lesions require data‐driven estimates of compartment‐specific T2 values. Finally, the “stick” fractions of different biophysical models could generally not serve as neurite density indices across the healthy brain and white matter lesions, where outcomes of comparisons depended on the choice of constraints. In particular, constraining compartment‐specific T2 values was ambiguous in the healthy brain and had a large impact on estimated values. In summary, estimating neurite density generally requires accounting for different diffusion and/or T2 properties between axons and dendrites. Constrained “index” parameters could be valid within limited domains that should be delineated by future studies.",

We also propose three lines for future research: (1) combine macro-, meso-, and \nmicro-level approaches to develop a more nuanced and context-dependent understanding of \ndiffusion and adoption; (2) clearly distinguish between innovation generation, innovation \ndiffusion, and innovation adoption; and (3) draw more extensively on open innovation and \ncollaborative innovation concepts given the crucial role of end-users in innovation diffusion \nand adoption.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study developed molecular dynamics (MD) models to investigate the diffusion behaviour of rejuvenator with aged binder. Four types of rejuvenators, straight saturate, cyclic saturate, naphthene aromatic, and polar aromatic, were proposed with different molecular structures. Both short-term and long-term aged asphalt binder models were established based on oxidation aging mechanism. Bi-layered models were built to study the inter-diffusion process between rejuvenators and aged asphalt binder. Results show that the diffusion of rejuvenators into asphalt binder can be described with Fick’s second diffusion law. The calculated diffusion coefficients indicated that with different molecular structures and functional groups, the diffusion ability of rejuvenators varied. It was found that long-term aging had a negative impact on diffusion behaviour. Moreover, polar aromatic performed the worst for diffusivity for both short-term and long-term aged binders, while naphthene aromatic achieved superior diffusion ability than saturate-based rejuvenators. The diffusion coefficient was proven to be significantly dependent on the chemical characteristics of rejuvenators, such as heteroatoms, molecular structures. The findings can provide microscopic insights on a selection of rejuvenators for better use of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) binder.",

It is therefore important to investigate hydroxide ion diffusion in AEMs with low water-to-cation ratios (λ ≤ 4, λ≡nH2O/ncation). In this work, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations are presented to explore hydroxide ion solvation complexes and diffusion mechanisms in model AEMs at low hydration. By changing the cation spacing within the AEM and the degree of hydration, six different idealized AEM models are created in which the water distribution is not uniform. It is shown that distinct water distributions impart unique OH– diffusion mechanisms that fall into three regimes. The observed mechanisms, nondiffusive, vehicular, and a mixture of structural and vehicular diffusion, depend on the presence or absence of a second solvation shell of the hydroxide ion and on the local water structure.

        "abstract": "Non-invasive estimation of brain microstructure features using diffusion MRI (dMRI)—known as Microstructure Imaging—has become an increasingly diverse and complicated field over the last decades. Multi-compartment (MC)-models, representing the measured diffusion signal as a linear combination of signal models of distinct tissue types, have been developed in many forms to estimate these features. However, a generalized implementation of MC-modeling as a whole, providing deeper insights in its capabilities, remains missing. To address this fact, we present Diffusion Microstructure Imaging in Python (Dmipy), an open-source toolbox implementing PGSE-based MC-modeling in its most general form. Dmipy allows on-the-fly implementation, signal modeling, and optimization of any user-defined MC-model, for any PGSE acquisition scheme. Dmipy follows a “building block”-based philosophy to Microstructure Imaging, meaning MC-models are modularly constructed to include any number and type of tissue models, allowing simultaneous representation of a tissue's diffusivity, orientation, volume fractions, axon orientation dispersion, and axon diameter distribution. In particular, Dmipy is geared toward facilitating reproducible, reliable MC-modeling pipelines, often allowing the whole process from model construction to parameter map recovery in fewer than 10 lines of code. To demonstrate Dmipy's ease of use and potential, we implement a wide range of well-known MC-models, including IVIM, AxCaliber, NODDI(x), Bingham-NODDI, the spherical mean-based SMT and MC-MDI, and spherical convolution-based single- and multi-tissue CSD. By allowing parameter cascading between MC-models, Dmipy also facilitates implementation of advanced approaches like CSD with voxel-varying kernels and single-shell 3-tissue CSD. By providing a well-tested, user-friendly toolbox that simplifies the interaction with the otherwise complicated field of dMRI-based Microstructure Imaging, Dmipy contributes to more reproducible, high-quality research.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The generation and development of interfacial adhesion properties between the asphalt binder and the aggregate surface is difficult to explain at the microscale through experiments. In this research, the models of asphalt–aggregate interface were constructed using four-component molecules of asphalt overlaid on two typical minerals of aggregate, respectively. Then the diffusion law of asphalt on the surface of aggregates and interfacial behaviour at microscale were analysed through the calculations of the diffusion coefficient, the Z-axis direction relative concentration and the dipole moment. Moreover, the distribution characteristics of four components of asphalt in the Z-axis direction in the asphalt–aggregate interface were analysed. The results showed that the increase in temperature could benefit the diffusion of asphalt on the aggregate surface and promote the adhesion between asphalt and aggregate. From the energetics perspective, the Van der Waals force between molecules was found to be the main factor driving the molecular movement during the diffusion process of asphalt on the surface of aggregate. Based on the molecular orientation theory, it was concluded that the polarity of asphalt and aggregate is the fundamental cause of adsorption of asphalt on the aggregate surface, and asphaltene and gelatine play an important role in adhesion of asphalt to aggregate.",

        "abstract": "In the era of large stellar spectroscopic surveys, there is an emphasis on deriving not only stellar abundances but also the ages for millions of stars. In the context of Galactic archeology, stellar ages provide a direct probe of the formation history of the Galaxy. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to compute models with atomic diffusion—with and without radiative acceleration—and extra mixing in the surface layers. The extra mixing consists of both density-dependent turbulent mixing and envelope overshoot mixing. Based on these models we argue that it is important to distinguish between initial, bulk abundances (parameters) and current, surface abundances (variables) in the analysis of individual stellar ages. In stars that maintain radiative regions on evolutionary timescales, atomic diffusion modifies the surface abundances. We show that when initial, bulk metallicity is equated with current, surface metallicity in isochrone age analysis, the resulting stellar ages can be systematically overestimated by up to 20%. The change of surface abundances with evolutionary phase also complicates chemical tagging, which is the concept that dispersed star clusters can be identified through unique, high-dimensional chemical signatures. Stars from the same cluster, but in different evolutionary phases, will show different surface abundances. We speculate that calibration of stellar models may allow us to estimate not only stellar ages but also initial abundances for individual stars. In the meantime, analyzing the chemical properties of stars in similar evolutionary phases is essential to minimize the effects of atomic diffusion in the context of chemical tagging.",

        "abstract": "Sequential sampling models such as the drift diffusion model have a long tradition in research on perceptual decision-making, but mounting evidence suggests that these models can account for response time distributions that arise during reinforcement learning and value-based decision-making. Building on this previous work, we implemented the drift diffusion model as the choice rule in inter-temporal choice (temporal discounting) and risky choice (probability discounting) using a hierarchical Bayesian estimation scheme. We validated our approach in data from nine patients with focal lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex / medial orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/mOFC) and nineteen age- and education-matched controls. Choice model parameters estimated via standard softmax action selection were reliably reproduced using the drift diffusion model as the choice rule, both for temporal discounting and risky choice. Model comparison revealed that, for both tasks, the data were best accounted for by a variant of the drift diffusion model including a non-linear mapping from value-differences to trial-wise drift rates. Posterior predictive checks of the winning models revealed a reasonably good fit to individual participants reaction time distributions. We then applied this modeling framework and 1) reproduced our previous results regarding temporal discounting in vmPFC/mOFC patients and 2) showed in a previously unpublished data set on risky choice that vmPFC/mOFC patients exhibit increased risk-taking relative to controls. Analyses of diffusion model parameters revealed that vmPFC/mOFC damage abolished neither value sensitivity nor asymptote of the drift rate. Rather, it substantially increased non-decision times and reduced response caution during risky choice. Our results highlight that novel insights can be gained from applying sequential sampling models in studies of inter-temporal and risky decision-making in cognitive neuroscience.",

        "abstract": "Understanding in-network information diffusion is a fundamental problem in many application domains and one of the primary challenges is to predict the size of the information cascade. Most of the existing models rely either on hypothesized point process (e.g., Poisson and Hawkes process), or simply predict the information propagation via deep neural networks. However, they fail to simultaneously capture the underlying structure of a cascade graph and the propagation of uncertainty in the diffusion, which may result in unsatisfactory prediction performance.To address these, in this work we propose a novel probabilistic cascade prediction framework: Variational Cascade (VaCas) graph learning networks. VaCas allows a non-linear information diffusion inference and models the information diffusion process by learning the latent representation of both the structural and temporal information. It is a pattern-agnostic model leveraging variational inference to learn the node-level and cascade-level latent factors in an unsupervised manner. In addition, VaCas is capable of capturing both the cascade representation uncertainty and node infection uncertainty, while enabling hierarchical pattern learning of information diffusion. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that VaCas significantly improves the prediction accuracy, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while also enabling interpretability.",

Several factors affect diffusion such as the characteristics of the initial adopters, the seeds; the structure of the network over which diffusion occurs; and the shape of the threshold distribution, which is the proportion of prior adopting peers needed for the focal individual to adopt. In this study, seven seeding conditions are modeled: (1) three opinion leadership indicators, (2) two bridging measures, (3) marginally positioned seeds, and (4) randomly selected seeds for comparison. Three network structures are modeled: (1) random, (2) small-world, and (3) scale-free. Four threshold distributions are modeled: (1) normal; (2) uniform; (3) beta 7,14; and (4) beta 1,2; all of which have a mean threshold of 33%, with different variances. The results show that seeding with nodes high on in-degree centrality and/or inverse constraint has faster and more widespread diffusion. Random networks had faster and higher prevalence of diffusion than scale-free ones, but not different from small-world ones. Compared with the normal threshold distribution, the uniform one had faster diffusion and the beta 7,14 distribution had slower diffusion. Most significantly, the threshold distribution standard deviation was associated with rate and prevalence such that higher threshold standard deviations accelerated diffusion and increased prevalence. These results underscore factors that health educators and public health advocates should consider when developing interventions or trying to understand the potential for behavior change.",

There are rather unexplored parameters that can influence polymer diffusion such as polymer semiflexibility or polydispersity, leading to a different exponent. Models with soft potentials or slip-springs can estimate accurately the tube model predictions in polymer melts enabling us to reach larger length scales and simulate well entangled polymers.

        "abstract": "Among the numerous anomalies of water, the acceleration of dynamics under pressure is particularly puzzling. Whereas the diffusivity anomaly observed in experiments has been reproduced in several computer studies, the parallel viscosity anomaly has received less attention. Here we simulate viscosity and the self-diffusion coefficient of the TIP4P/2005 water model over a broad temperature and pressure range. We reproduce the experimental behavior and find additional anomalies at negative pressure. The anomalous effect of pressure on dynamic properties becomes more pronounced upon cooling, reaching two orders of magnitude for viscosity at 220 K. We analyze our results with a dynamic extension of a thermodynamic two-state model, an approach which has proved successful in describing experimental data. Water is regarded as a mixture of interconverting species with contrasting dynamic behaviors, one being strong (Arrhenius) and the other fragile (non-Arrhenius). The dynamic parameters of the two-state models are remarkably close between experiment and simulations. The larger pressure range accessible to simulations suggests a modification of the dynamic two-state model, which in turn also improves the agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate the decoupling between viscosity η and self-diffusion coefficient D as a function of temperature T. The Stokes-Einstein relation, which predicts a constant Dη/T, is violated when T is lowered, in connection with the Widom line defined by an equal fraction of the two interconverting species. These results provide a unifying picture of thermodynamics and dynamics in water and call for experiments at negative pressure.",

As before the free boundary represents the spreading front of the species, but here the population dispersal is described by \"nonlocal diffusion\" instead of \"local diffusion\". We prove that such a nonlocal diffusion problem with free boundary has a unique global solution, and for models with Lotka-Volterra type competition or predator-prey growth terms, we show that a spreading-vanishing dichotomy holds, and obtain criteria for spreading and vanishing; moreover, for the weak competition case and for the weak predation case, we can determine the long-time asymptotic limit of the solution when spreading happens. Compared with the single species free boundary model with nonlocal diffusion considered recently in [7], and the two species cases with local diffusion extensively studied in the literature, the situation considered in this paper involves several new difficulties, which are overcome by the use of some new techniques.",

        "abstract": "Hydrogels are attractive biomaterials for replicating cellular microenvironments, but attention needs to be given to hydrogels diffusion properties. A large body of literature shows the promise of hydrogels as 3D culture models, cell expansion systems, cell delivery vehicles, and tissue constructs. Surprisingly, literature seems to have overlooked the important effects of nutrient diffusion on the viability of hydrogel‐encapsulated cells. In this paper, we present the methods and results of an investigation into glucose and oxygen diffusion into a silated‐hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (Si‐HPMC) hydrogel. Using both an implantable glucose sensor and implantable oxygen sensor, we continuously monitored core glucose concentration and oxygen concentration at the centre of hydrogels. We demonstrated that we could tune molecular transport in Si‐HPMC hydrogel by changing the polymer concentration. Specifically, the oxygen diffusion coefficient was found to significantly decrease from 3.4 × 10−10 to 2.4 × 10−10 m2 s−1 as the polymer concentration increased from 1% to 4% (w/v). Moreover, it was revealed during in vitro culture of cellularized hydrogels that oxygen depletion occurred before glucose depletion, suggesting oxygen diffusion is the major limiting factor for cell survival. Insight was also gained into the mechanism of action by which oxygen and glucose diffuse. Indeed, a direct correlation was found between the average polymer crosslinking node size and glucose parameters, and this correlation was not observed for oxygen. Overall, these experiments provide useful insights for the analysis of nutrient transport and gas exchange in hydrogels and for the development of future cellular microenvironments based on Si‐HPMC or similar polysaccharide hydrogels.",

In our framework, graph-based modeling is formulated as a graph system identification problem, where the goal is to learn a weighted graph (a graph Laplacian matrix) and a graph-based filter (a function of graph Laplacian matrices). In order to solve the proposed problem, an algorithm is developed to jointly identify a graph and a graph-based filter (GBF) from multiple signal/data observations. Our algorithm is valid under the assumption that GBFs are one-to-one functions. The proposed approach can be applied to learn diffusion (heat) kernels, which are popular in various fields for modeling diffusion processes. In addition, for specific choices of graph-based filters, the proposed problem reduces to a graph Laplacian estimation problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We also implement our framework on a real climate dataset for modeling of temperature signals.",

        "abstract": "Asphalt-aggregate interface properties are considered to play a crucial role in asphalt mixture. To better understand the detailed binding mechanism, the present study analyzed the adhesion and diffusion of asphalt binder on mineral surfaces at a nanoscale based on molecular dynamics simulation. A 12-component AAA-1 asphalt model and five oxide models were generated to represent asphalt binder and mineral aggregates, respectively. The effectiveness of these models was validated by comparing the physical properties of the model with the values reported in the literature. The binding energy and diffusion coefficient obtained were examined to characterize the adhesion and diffusion of asphalt on different mineral surfaces. The results indicated that van der Waals energy played the main role in forming the strong physisorption of asphalt on the mineral surface. Among all four fractions of asphalt, asphaltene made a great contribution to the adhesion of asphalt on the mineral surface. It was also found that the work of adhesion between asphalt and five oxides ranked MgO > CaO > Al2O3 > Fe2O3 > SiO2. The content of MgO and CaO in mineral aggregates can be further adopted as an index to evaluate and classify mineral aggregates during asphalt mixture design. Meanwhile, asphalt mobility does not entirely rely on the molecular mass but also depends strongly on the medium it adsorbed into and interaction energy. This work provides a fundamental understanding of the adhesion and diffusion of asphalt binder on the mineral aggregate surface at the atomistic scale.",

The improvement with respect to the known models has been driven by recent results obtained from historical data collection and the suggestions given by the World Health Organization: the characteristics of the virus diffusion, mainly by body fluids, imply the trivial fact that wise behaviors of healthy subjects and fast timely recognition of a new positive diagnosis should reduce the spread quite fast. Therefore, the set of susceptible subjects is divided into two categories: the wise people that, suitably informed, avoid dangerous behaviors, and the ones that, with irresponsible acts, could get the infection. The set of infected subjects is constituted by people who are still not aware of being infected (and therefore are responsible of the HIV spread), along with the subjects aware of being infected by HIV or AIDS. Inspired by the international guidelines suggestions, three controls are introduced, aiming both at the prevention and at the cure: an informative campaign, a test campaign, and an HIV/AIDS therapy action. Among them, the core of the control effort is a fast HIV diagnosis. The equilibrium points, their stability, and the influences of the introduced inputs to the system behavior are studied, yielding to preliminary statements for prospective works on suitable control design approaches.",

        "abstract": "Background Motor symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) have exhibited lateral asymmetry, suggesting asymmetric neuronal loss in the substantia nigra (SN). Diffusion MRI may be able to help confirm tissue microstructural alterations in the substantia nigra to probe for the presence of asymmetry. Purpose To investigate lateral asymmetry in the SN of patients with PD by using diffusion MRI with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian models. Materials and Methods In this cross-sectional study conducted from March 2015 to March 2017, 27 participants with PD and 27 age-matched healthy control (HC) participants, all right handed, underwent MRI at 3.0 T. High-spatial-resolution diffusion images were acquired with a reduced field of view by using seven b values up to 3000 sec/mm2. A continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) non-Gaussian diffusion model was used to produce anomalous diffusion coefficient (Dm) and temporal (α) and spatial (β) diffusion heterogeneity indexes followed by a Gaussian diffusion model to yield an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Individual or linear combinations of diffusion parameters in the SN were unilaterally and bilaterally compared between the PD and HC groups. Results In the bilateral comparison between the PD and HC groups, differences were observed in β (0.67 ± 0.06 [standard deviation] vs 0.64 ± 0.04, respectively; P = .016), ADC (0.48 μm2/msec ± 0.08 vs 0.53 μm2/msec ± 0.06, respectively; P = .03), and the combination of CTRW parameters (P = .02). In the unilateral comparison, differences were observed in all diffusion parameters on the left SN (P < .03), but not on the right (P > .20). In a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to delineate left SN abnormality in PD, the combination of Dm, α, and β produced the best sensitivity (sensitivity, 0.78); the combination of Dm and β produced the best specificity (specificity, 0.85); and the combination of α and β produced the largest area under the ROC curve (area under the ROC curve, 0.73). Conclusion These results suggest that quantitative diffusion MRI is sensitive to brain tissue changes in participants with Parkinson disease and provide evidence of substantia nigra lateral asymmetry in this disease. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

The boundary conditions of the proposed model correspond with the real situation in the electrolytes of solid oxide hydrogen fuel cells (SOFC). The role of the ratio of grain boundary and grain diffusion coefficients in perpendicular and parallel (to the surface) concentration profiles is investigated. In order to show the influence of absolute values of grain and grain boundary diffusion coefficients, we select four different cases in which one of the diffusion coefficients is kept constant while the others vary. The influence of grain size on diffusion processes is investigated using different geometrical models. The impact of kinetic processes taking place on the surface is analyzed by comparing results obtained assuming the first layer as a constant source and then involving in the model the processes of adsorption and desorption. It is shown that surface processes have a significant influence on the depth distribution of diffusing atoms and cannot be ignored. The analytical function of overall concentration dependence on grain and grain boundary volume ratio (Vg/Vgb) is found. The solution suggests that the concentration increases as a complementary error function while Vg/Vgb decreases.",

The task has a long history in psychology and modern applications in the clinical/neuropsychological domain. In this article, we fit a diffusion model to both experimental and simulated data. The model is the same as the two-choice model and assumes that there are two decision boundaries and termination at one of them produces a response, and at the other, the subject waits out the trial. In prior modeling, both two-choice and go/no-go data were fit simultaneously, and only group data were fit. Here the model is fit to just go/no-go data for individual subjects. This allows analyses of individual differences, which is important for clinical applications. First, we fit the standard two-choice model to two-choice data and fit the go/no-go model to reaction times (RTs) from one of the choices and accuracy from the two-choice data. Parameter values were similar between the models and had high correlations. The go/no-go model was also fit to data from a go/no-go version of the task with the same subjects as the two-choice task. A simulation study with ranges of parameter values that are obtained in practice showed similar parameter recovery between the two-choice and go/no-go models. Results show that a diffusion model with an implicit (no response) boundary can be fit to data with almost the same accuracy as fitting the two-choice model to two-choice data.",

The key to an optimized layout of these processes is the knowledge of the overall diffusive hindrance factor H(λ) = Deff,H(λ)/Dm, which quantifies the degree to which diffusion through a material (represented by the effective diffusion coefficient Deff,H) is hindered compared with diffusion in the bulk liquid (represented by Dm) in dependence of λ, the ratio of solute size to mean pore size. To arrive at an adequate hindrance factor expression for random mesoporous silica, we use electron tomography to physically reconstruct the mesopore space of three macro-mesoporous silica monoliths.

The context of international development cooperation has been particularly fertile in the cross-pollination of ideas, models and policy experiments, and the articles in this Special Issue draw deeply on this insight.

Here we present an event of fast inward radial diffusion, occurring during a period following the geomagnetic storm of 17 March 2015. Ultrarelativistic electrons up to ∼8 MeV are accelerated in the absence of intense higher‐frequency plasma waves, indicating an acceleration event in the core of the outer belt driven primarily or entirely by ULF wave‐driven diffusion. We examine this fast diffusion rate along with derived radial diffusion coefficients using particle and fields instruments on the Van Allen Probes spacecraft mission.",

        "abstract": "Building upon existing literature, we offer a particular model of network policy diffusion—which we call sustained organizational influence. Sustained organizational influence necessitates an institutional focus across a broad range of issues and across a long period of time. Sustaining organizations are wellfinanced, and exert their influence on legislators through benefits, shared ideological interests, and time-saving opportunities. Sustaining organizations’ centralized nature makes legislators’ jobs easier by providing legislators with ready-made model legislation. We argue that sustaining organizations uniquely contribute to policy diffusion in the U.S. states. We evaluate this model with a case study of state-level immigration sanctuary policy making and the role that the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) played in disseminating model legislation. Through quantitative text analysis and several negative binomial state-level regression models, we demonstrate that ALEC has exerted an overwhelming influence on the introduction of anti-sanctuary legislative proposals in the U.S. states over the past 7 years consistent with our particular model of network policy diffusion. Implications are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion-based models of grating formation in photopolymers have been proposed in which the rate of mono- mer polymerization (removal) is directly proportional to the illuminating intensity inside the medium. How-ever, based on photochemical considerations, the rate of polymerization is proportional in the steady state to the square root of the interference intensity. Recently it was shown that, by introducing a nonlocal response function into the one-dimensional diffusion equation that governs holographic grating formation in photopoly- mers, one can deduce both high-frequency and low-frequency cutoffs in the spatial-frequency response of photopolymer materials. Here the ﬁrst-order nonlocal coupled diffusion equations are derived for the case of a general relationship between the rate of polymerization and the exposing intensity. Assuming a two- harmonic monomer expansion, the resultant analytic solutions are then used to ﬁt experimental growth curves for gratings fabricated with different spatial frequencies.

The results on existence and uniqueness of solutions of these problems as well as on the fractional time diffusion (subdiffusion) equations are presented. Consequently, the obtained results are applied for the similar inverse problems for a large class of subelliptic diffusion and subdiffusion equations (with continuous spectrum). Such problems are modelled by using general homogeneous left-invariant hypoelliptic operators on general graded Lie groups. A list of examples is discussed, including Sturm–Liouville problems, differential models with involution, fractional Sturm–Liouville operators, harmonic and anharmonic oscillators, Landau Hamiltonians, fractional Laplacians, and harmonic and anharmonic operators on the Heisenberg group. The rod cooling problem for the diffusion with involution is modelled numerically, showing how to find a “cooling function”, and how the involution normally slows down the cooling speed of the rod.",

The manufacturing processes of those materials have typically strong impact on their final microstructure, which at the same time controls the mechanical performance of the part. A reliable virtual engineering design of fiber-reinforced polymers requires therefore considering the simulation of the process-induced microstructure. One relevant microstructure descriptor in fiber-reinforced polymers is the fiber orientation. This work focuses on the modeling of the fiber orientation phenomenon and presents a historical review of the different modelling approaches. In this context, the article describes different macroscopic fiber orientation models such as the Folgar-Tucker, nematic, reduced strain closure (RSC), retarding principal rate (RPR), anisotropic rotary diffusion (ARD), principal anisotropic rotary diffusion (pARD), and Moldflow rotary diffusion (MRD) model. We discuss briefly about closure approximations, which are a common mathematical element of those macroscopic fiber orientation models. In the last section, we introduce some micro-scale numerical methods for simulating the fiber orientation phenomenon, such as the discrete element method (DEM), the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method and the moving particle semi-implicit (MPS) method.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To investigate the performance of integrated approaches that combined intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and non-Gaussian diffusion parameters compared with the Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) to establish multiparameter thresholds scores or probabilities by using Bayesian analysis to distinguish malignant from benign breast lesions and their correlation with molecular prognostic factors. Materials and Methods Between May 2013 and March 2015, 411 patients were prospectively enrolled and 199 patients (allocated to training [n = 99] and validation [n = 100] sets) were included in this study. IVIM parameters (flowing blood volume fraction [fIVIM] and pseudodiffusion coefficient [D*]) and non-Gaussian diffusion parameters (theoretical apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC] at b value of 0 sec/mm2 [ADC0] and kurtosis [K]) by using IVIM and kurtosis models were estimated from diffusion-weighted image series (16 b values up to 2500 sec/mm2), as well as a synthetic ADC (sADC) calculated by using b values of 200 and 1500 (sADC200-1500) and a standard ADC calculated by using b values of 0 and 800 sec/mm2 (ADC0-800). The performance of two diagnostic approaches (combined parameter thresholds and Bayesian analysis) combining IVIM and diffusion parameters was evaluated and compared with BI-RADS performance. The Mann-Whitney U test and a nonparametric multiple comparison test were used to compare their performance to determine benignity or malignancy and as molecular prognostic biomarkers and subtypes of breast cancer. Results Significant differences were found between malignant and benign breast lesions for IVIM and non-Gaussian diffusion parameters (ADC0, K, fIVIM, fIVIM · D*, sADC200-1500, and ADC0-800; P < .05). Sensitivity and specificity for the validation set by radiologists A and B were as follows: sensitivity, 94.7% and 89.5%, and specificity, 75.0% and 79.2% for sADC200-1500, respectively; sensitivity, 94.7% and 96.1%, and specificity, 75.0% and 66.7%, for the combined thresholds approach, respectively; sensitivity, 92.1% and 92.1%, and specificity, 83.3% and 66.7%, for Bayesian analysis, respectively; and sensitivity and specificity, 100% and 79.2%, for BI-RADS, respectively. The significant difference in values of sADC200-1500 in progesterone receptor status (P = .002) was noted. sADC200-1500 was significantly different between histologic subtypes (P = .006). Conclusion Approaches that combined various IVIM and non-Gaussian diffusion MR imaging parameters may provide BI-RADS-equivalent scores almost comparable to BI-RADS categories without the use of contrast agents. Non-Gaussian diffusion parameters also differed by biologic prognostic factors. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "abstract": "While gliomas have been extensively modelled with a reaction–diffusion (RD) type equation it is most likely an oversimplification. In this study, three mathematical models of glioma growth are developed and systematically investigated to establish a framework for accurate prediction of changes in tumour volume as well as intra-tumoural heterogeneity. Tumour cell movement was described by coupling movement to tissue stress, leading to a mechanically coupled (MC) RD model. Intra-tumour heterogeneity was described by including a voxel-specific carrying capacity (CC) to the RD model. The MC and CC models were also combined in a third model. To evaluate these models, rats (n = 14) with C6 gliomas were imaged with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging over 10 days to estimate tumour cellularity. Model parameters were estimated from the first three imaging time points and then used to predict tumour growth at the remaining time points which were then directly compared to experimental data. The results in this work demonstrate that mechanical–biological effects are a necessary component of brain tissue tumour modelling efforts. The results are suggestive that a variable tissue carrying capacity is a needed model component to capture tumour heterogeneity. Lastly, the results advocate the need for additional effort towards capturing tumour-to-tissue infiltration.",

        "abstract": "\n Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) by solvent injection offers significant potential to increase recovery from shale oil reservoirs, which is typically between 3 and 7% original oil in place (OOIP). The rather sparse literature on this topic typically models these tight reservoirs on the basis of conventional-reservoir processes and mechanisms, such as by convective transport using Darcy's law, even though there is little physical justification for this treatment. The literature also downplays the importance of the soaking period in huff ’n’ puff.\n In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a more physically realistic recovery mechanism based on solely diffusion-dominated transport. We develop a diffusion-dominated proxy model assuming first-contact miscibility (FCM) to provide rapid estimates of oil recovery for both primary production and the solvent huff ’n’ soak ’n’ puff (HSP) process in ultratight oil reservoirs. Simplified proxy models are developed to represent the major features of the fracture network.\n The key results show that diffusion-transport considered solely can reproduce the primary-production period within the Eagle Ford Shale and can model the HSP process well, without the need to use Darcy's law. The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) concept is not important for ultratight shales where diffusion dominates because MMP is based on advection-dominated conditions. The mechanism for recovery is based solely on density and concentration gradients. Primary production is modeled as a self-diffusion process, whereas the HSP process is modeled as a counter-diffusion process. Incremental recoveries by HSP are several times greater than primary-production recoveries, showing significant promise in increasing oil recoveries. We calculate ultimate recoveries for both primary production and for the HSP process, and show that methane injection is preferred over carbon dioxide injection. We also show that the proxy model, to be accurate, must match the total matrix-contact area and the ratio of effective area to total contact area with time. These two parameters should be maximized for best recovery.",

In this model, each particle $i$ carries two attributes: the spatial location $X_t^i\\in \\mathbb{T}^d$, and the type $\\Xi_t^i\\in \\{1,\\cdots,n\\}$. While $X_t^i$ is a standard (independent) diffusion process, the evolution of the type $\\Xi_t^i$ is described by pairwise interactions between different particles under a series of chemical reactions described by a chemical reaction network. We prove that in the large particle limit the stochastic dynamics converges to a mean field limit which is described by a nonlocal reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. In particular, we obtain a quantitative propagation of chaos result for the interacting particle system. Our proof is based on the relative entropy method used recently by Jabin and Wang \\cite{JW18}. The key ingredient of the relative entropy method is a large deviation estimate for a special partition function, which was proved previously by technical combinatorial estimates. We give a simple probabilistic proof based on a novel martingale argument.",

The interfacial behaviour at molecular scale was simulated by setting boundary conditions, optimising the structure and canonical ensemble. The mean square displacement and diffusion coefficient of particles were selected to study the diffusion of asphalt components on the surface of different minerals. The results show that increasing the temperature can accelerate the diffusion of asphalt components. The diffusion speed of asphalt components on the surface of Al2O3 is faster than other mineral crystals. The temperature sensitivity of diffusion coefficient of asphalt components on the surface of CaO is the maximum. The diffusion speed of asphalt components ranked roughly as their molecular weight: saturate > aromatics > resin > asphaltene.",

Models with continuous non-Abelian symmetries are ubiquitous in physics, arising in diverse settings ranging from hot nuclear matter to cold atomic gases and quantum spin chains. In every dimension and for every flavor symmetry group, the low energy theory is a set of coupled noisy diffusion equations. Independence of the physics on the choice of canonical or microcanonical ensemble is manifest in our hydrodynamic expansion, even though the ensemble choice causes an apparent shift in quasinormal mode spectra. We use our formalism to explain why flavor symmetry is qualitatively different from hydrodynamics with other non-Abelian conservation laws, including angular momentum and charge multipoles. As a significant application of our framework, we study spin and energy diffusion in classical one-dimensional SU(2)-invariant spin chains, including the Heisenberg model along with multiple generalizations. We argue based on both numerical simulations and our effective field theory framework that non-integrable spin chains on a lattice exhibit conventional spin diffusion, in contrast to some recent predictions that diffusion constants grow logarithmically at late times. We show that the apparent enhancement of diffusion is due to slow equilibration caused by (non-Abelian) hydrodynamic fluctuations.",

The posterior range of the diffusion coefficient is obtained by performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo random walk and calibrating on the experimental data of $D$-meson $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ and $v_2$ in three different collision systems at RHIC and the LHC: AuAu collisions at 200 GeV, PbPb collisions at 2.76 and 5.02 TeV. The spatial diffusion coefficient is found to be consistent with lattice QCD calculations and comparable with other models' estimation. We demonstrate the capability of our improved Langevin model to simultaneously describe the $R_{\\mathrm{AA}}$ and $v_2$ at both RHIC and the LHC energies, as well as the higher order flow coefficient such as $D$-meson $v_3$. We show that by applying a Bayesian analysis, we are able to quantitatively and systematically study the heavy flavor dynamics in heavy-ion collisions.",

        "abstract": "Protests and democratic transitions tend to spread cross-nationally. Is this true of all political events? We argue that the mechanisms underlying the diffusion of mass-participation events are unlikely to support the spread of elite-led violence, particularly coups. Further, past findings of coup contagion employed empirical techniques unable to distinguish clustering, common shocks, and actual diffusion. To investigate which events diffuse and where, we combine modern spatial dependence models with extreme bounds analysis (EBA). EBA allows for numerous modeling alternatives, including diffusion timing and the controls, and calculates the distribution of estimates across all combinations of these choices. We also examine various diffusion pathways, such as contagion among trade partners. Results from nearly 1.2 million models clearly undercut coup contagion. In comparison, we confirm that more mass-driven political events robustly spread cross-nationally. Our findings contribute to studies of political conflict and contagion, while introducing EBA as an effective tool for diffusion scholars.",

        "abstract": "Brain imaging technology has allowed researchers to conduct rigorous studies of the dynamic course of alcoholism through periods of drinking, sobriety, and relapse and to gain insights into the effects of chronic alcoholism on the human brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have distinguished alcohol-related brain effects that are permanent from those that are reversible with abstinence. In support of postmortem neuropathological studies showing degeneration of white matter, MRI studies have shown a specific vulnerability of white matter to chronic alcohol exposure. Such studies have demonstrated white-matter volume deficits as well as damage to selective gray-matter structures. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), by permitting microstructural characterization of white matter, has extended MRI findings in alcoholics. MR spectroscopy (MRS) allows quantification of several metabolites that shed light on brain biochemical alterations caused by alcoholism. This article focuses on MRI, DTI, and MRS findings in neurological disorders that commonly co-occur with alcoholism, including Wernicke’s encephalopathy, Korsakoff’s syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. Also reviewed are neuroimaging findings in animal models of alcoholism and related neurological disorders. This report also suggests that the dynamic course of alcoholism presents a unique opportunity to examine brain structural and functional repair and recovery.",

Different constitutive models are considered in order to understand the diffusion of fluid through the glass fiber-reinforced polymer plates. The macroscopic models of this work, Fickian and Gurtin coupled deformation–diffusion, are first considered in order to describe the macroscopic diffusion behaviors.

This study explored the “how” of policy diffusion by focusing on college completion policies, especially performance funding. In particular, we examined the roles that intermediaries play in state-level college completion policy diffusion. Data are from 3 states and include observations of policy events, documents, and interviews with 56 participants, including state policy actors and intermediary representatives. This analysis, grounded in conceptual models of policy diffusion, revealed that diffusion occurs at various stages of the policy process, not just adoption. The study also demonstrated the coercive roles that intermediaries can play in promoting policies and revealed how intermediaries facilitate, and sometimes limit, policy learning, which is one of the primary mechanisms by which policies diffuse. By focusing on an underexplored conceptual model of policy diffusion, the national interaction model, this analysis shed light on the role played by intermediaries in state-level college completion policymaking.",

        "abstract": "The rate of photosynthesis depends on the CO2 partial pressure near Rubisco, Cc, which is commonly calculated by models using the overall mesophyll resistance. Such models do not explain the difference between the CO2 level in the intercellular air space and Cc mechanistically. This problem can be overcome by reaction-diffusion models for CO2 transport, production and fixation in leaves. However, most reaction-diffusion models are complex and unattractive for procedures that require a large number of runs, like parameter optimisation. This study provides a simpler reaction-diffusion model. It is parameterized by both leaf physiological and leaf anatomical data. The anatomical data consisted of the thickness of the cell wall, cytosol and stroma, and the area ratios of mesophyll exposed to the intercellular air space to leaf surfaces and exposed chloroplast to exposed mesophyll surfaces. The model was used directly to estimate photosynthetic parameters from a subset of the measured light and CO2 response curves; the remaining data were used for validation. The model predicted light and CO2 response curves reasonably well for 15 days old tomato (cv. Admiro) leaves, if (photo)respiratory CO2 release was assumed to take place in the inner cytosol or in the gaps between the chloroplasts. The model was also used to calculate the fraction of CO2 produced by (photo)respiration that is re-assimilated in the stroma, and this fraction ranged from 56 to 76%. In future research, the model should be further validated to better understand how the re-assimilation of (photo)respired CO2 is affected by environmental conditions and physiological parameters.",

We develop a novel approach for the study of diffusion among IOs. This approach consists of three components: a theoretical focus on connectivity among IOs as pathways for diffusion; a conceptual differentiation between alternative types of convergence effects; and a methodological strategy combining dyadic and spatial analysis of diffusion. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach through an empirical case: the diffusion of participatory governance arrangements among IOs from 1970 to 2010. The analysis shows that connectivity among IOs contributes to convergence, which typically is manifested through imitation of very specific institutional models. The article's findings have implications both for the study of IOs and for the general study of diffusion.",

Many efforts are being focused on the development of novel modelling approaches for the description of anomalous diffusion in biological systems, such as the very complex and heterogeneous cell environment. Nevertheless, many questions are still open, such as the joint manifestation of statistical features in agreement with different models that can also be somewhat alternative to each other, e.g. continuous time random walk and fractional Brownian motion. To overcome these limitations, we propose a stochastic diffusion model with additive noise and linear friction force (linear Langevin equation), thus involving the explicit modelling of velocity dynamics. The complexity of the medium is parametrized via a population of intensity parameters (relaxation time and diffusivity of velocity), thus introducing an additional randomness, in addition to white noise, in the particle's dynamics. We prove that, for proper distributions of these parameters, we can get both Gaussian anomalous diffusion, fractional diffusion and its generalizations.",

Four types of agents, i.e., susceptible, informed, known, and refractory ones, are involved in the system, and the affinity mechanism composing of an affinity threshold which represents the fitness of information to be propagated is incorporated. The model can be generally described by a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain, which is governed by its master (Kolmogorov) equation. Based on the Wei-Norman method, we derive analytical solutions of the model by constructing a low-dimensional Lie algebra.

        "abstract": "With the increase of social networking websites and the interaction frequency among users, the prediction of information diffusion is required to support effective generalization and efficient inference in the context of social big data era. However, the existing models either rely on expensive probabilistic modeling of information diffusion based on partially known network structures, or discover the implicit structures of diffusion from users’ behaviors without considering the impacts of different diffused contents. To address the issues, in this paper, we propose a novel information-dependent embedding-based diffusion prediction (IEDP) model to map the users in observed diffusion process into a latent embedding space, then the temporal order of users with the timestamps in the cascade can be preserved by the embedding distance of users. Our proposed model further learns the propagation probability of information in the cascade as a function of the relative positions of information-specific user embeddings in the information-dependent subspace. Then, the problem of temporal propagation prediction can be converted into the task of spatial probability learning in the embedding space. Moreover, we present an efficient margin-based optimization algorithm with a fast computation to make the inference of the information diffusion in the latent embedding space. When applying our proposed method to several social network datasets, the experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach for the information diffusion prediction and the efficiency with respect to the inference speed compared with the state-of-the-art methods.",

The former originate from epidemiology, and consider information as a viral contagion which spreads into a population of online users. The latter have roots in geophysics and finance, view individual actions as discrete events in continuous time, and modulate the rate of events according to the self-exciting nature of event sequences. Here, we establish a novel connection between these two frameworks. Namely, the rate of events in an extended Hawkes model is identical to the rate of new infections in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model after marginalizing out recovery events -- which are unobserved in a Hawkes process. This result paves the way to apply tools developed for SIR to Hawkes, and vice versa. It also leads to HawkesN, a generalization of the Hawkes model which accounts for a finite population size. Finally, we derive the distribution of cascade sizes for HawkesN, inspired by methods in stochastic SIR. Such distributions provide nuanced explanations to the general unpredictability of popularity: the distribution for diffusion cascade sizes tends to have two modes, one corresponding to large cascade sizes and another one around zero.",

Investigation reveals that experimental values of coefficients of diffusion of CH4 and CO2 in random homogeneous isotropic sphere packing of coal samples are in good agreement with the results of theoretical calculations.

        "abstract": "We present a study of the diffusion of krypton in UO2 using atomic scale calculations combined with diffusion models adapted to the system studied. The migration barriers of the elementary mechanisms for interstitial or vacancy assisted migration are calculated in the DFT+U framework using the nudged elastic band method. The attempt frequencies are obtained from the phonon modes of the defect at the initial and saddle points using empirical potential methods. The diffusion coefficients of Kr in UO2 are then calculated by combining this data with diffusion models accounting for the concentration of vacancies and the interaction of vacancies with Kr atoms. We determined the preferred mechanism for Kr migration and the corresponding diffusion coefficient as a function of the oxygen chemical potential μO or nonstoichiometry. For very hypostoichiometric (or U-rich) conditions, the most favorable mechanism is interstitial migration. For hypostoichiometric UO2, migration is assisted by the bound Schottky defect and the charged uranium vacancy, VU4-. Around stoichiometry, migration assisted by the charged uranium-oxygen divacancy (VUO2-) and VU4- is the favored mechanism. Finally, for hyperstoichiometric or O-rich conditions, the migration assisted by two VU4- dominates. Kr migration is enhanced at higher μO, and in this regime, the activation energy will be between 4.09 and 0.73 eV depending on nonstoichiometry. The experimental values available are in the latter interval. Since it is very probable that these values were obtained for at least slightly hyperstoichiometric samples, our activation energies are consistent with the experimental data, even if further experiments with precisely controlled stoichiometry are needed to confirm these results. The mechanisms and trends with nonstoichiometry established for Kr are similar to those found in previous studies of Xe.",

        "abstract": "We use a high‐resolution water isotope record from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core (WDC) to evaluate the effects of water isotope diffusion for the last 29 ka B.P. Using spectral analysis of the data, we determine diffusion lengths in depth and time domains. The diffusion length quantifies the mean cumulative diffusive displacement of water molecules relative to their original location at time of deposition. We simulate the observed signal with models and find that our understanding of processes and conditions in the ice sheet is incomplete. With the effects of ice‐deformational thinning removed, portions of the Holocene record show total diffusion lengths smaller than predicted for a lower limit case of diffusion through a single ice crystal. Such reduced diffusion is probably due to structural features such as crusts and tortuous porosity that inhibit vapor transport in the firn. In the late glacial portion of the record, diffusion lengths double between ~19.5 and 17 ka B.P. Known dependencies of diffusion on climatic variables do not account for this enhancement in models, and we hypothesize that it could arise from thermal gradients in the firn column, impurity‐driven enhancement of solid ice diffusion, or changes in firn grain properties that alter vapor access to open pores. Despite model uncertainties, the WDC diffusion length chronology will be an essential input to future studies of high‐frequency variability in the water isotope climate record, as it allows for the effects of diffusion to be removed.",

In particular, we derive variants of compressible/incompressible Maxwell/Oldroyd-B models with a stress diffusion term in the evolution equation for the extra stress tensor. It is shown that the stress diffusion term can be interpreted either as a consequence of a nonlocal energy storage mechanism or as a consequence of a nonlocal entropy production mechanism, while different interpretations of the stress diffusion mechanism lead to different evolution equations for the temperature. The benefits of the knowledge of the thermodynamical background of the derived models are documented in the study of nonlinear stability of equilibrium rest states.

The crystals were physicochemically characterized and the release experiments were carried out under the sink conditions, while mathematical models were described as extrapolations from solutions of the diffusion equation, in different initial and boundary conditions imposed by pharmaceutical formulations. The diffusion equation was solved using Laplace and Fourier transformed functions for release kinetics from infinite reservoirs in a semi-infinite medium. Solutions represents a general square root law and can be applied for the release kinetic of fluorescein from lyotropic colloidal liquid crystals. Akaike, Schwartz, and Imbimbo criteria were used to establish the appropriate mathematical model and the hierarchy of the performances of different models applied to the release experiments. The Fisher statistic test was applied to obtain the significance of differences among mathematical models. Differences of mathematical criteria demonstrated that small or no significant statistic differences were carried out between the various applied models and colloidal formulations. Phenomenological models were preferred over the empirical and semi-empirical ones. The general square root model shows that the diffusion-controlled release of fluorescein is the mathematical models extrapolated for lyotropic colloidal liquid crystals.",

        "abstract": "The radial and rigidity dependence of the cosmic ray (CR) diffusion tensor is investigated on the basis of a recently developed 2D and slab turbulence transport model using nearly incompressible theory. We study CR diffusion coefficients in two regions: 0.29 to 1 au, and 1 to 75 au. In the former case, we use 2D and radial slab turbulence transport models, and in the latter case, 2D and perpendicular slab turbulence transport models. We employ quasi-linear theory and nonlinear guiding center theory, respectively, to determine the parallel and perpendicular elements of the CR diffusion tensor. We also present the effect of both weak and moderately strong turbulence on the drift element of the CR diffusion tensor. We find that in the solar wind ecliptic plane (1) the radial mean free path (mfp) is dominated by diffusion parallel to the mean magnetic field and is nearly constant from 0.29 to 1 au; (2) from 1 to 75 au, the role of the perpendicular mfp becomes increasingly important despite the parallel mfp being about three orders of magnitude larger than the perpendicular mfp. The radial mfp initially decays slowly and then faster after ∼6 au; (3) beyond ∼10 au, pickup-ion-driven turbulence is the most important factor in determining the various mean free paths since stream interactions weaken with increasing heliocentric distance; (4) the rigidity (P) dependence of the parallel mfp is proportional to from 10 to 103 MV, but in the distant heliosphere, its dependence increases for higher rigidities and is proportional to . In contrast, the perpendicular mfp is weakly influenced by CR rigidity; (5) the drift length scale is comparable to the perpendicular mfp beyond ∼10 au; and (6) strong turbulence may introduce a new “drift” component, the direction of which is normal to the mean magnetic field.",

        "abstract": "Random motions can be found all across science and engineering. Examples of random motions include: diffusion of particles in physics and chemistry, turbulent flows, search patterns of foraging animals, spreading of contaminants in geological and hydrological systems, patterns of data traffic in communication channels, and fluctuations in financial markets. A characteristic feature of such random motion – the so-called diffusion process – is the linear growth with time exhibited by themean square displacement. In contrast with this situation, a large class of systems and processes exhibit a nonlinear time dependence of the same quantity, thus constituting what is called an anomalous diffusion behaviour. In the last decades, there has been an increased interest in the theoretical modelling and practical applications of anomalous diffusion processes in a variety of experimental scenarios in physics, chemistry, biology and several other branches of engineering. Fractional calculus is a branch of mathematics in taking nth-power of a differential or integral operator, where the order ‘n’ is not necessarily a positive integer number (n = 1, 2 . . . ). Its origin can be traced back to 30 September 1695, when the derivative of order n = 1⁄2 was described by Leibniz in his letter to L’ Hopital. It has been studied by many great mathematicians such as Fourier, Euler, Laplace, Liouville, Riemann, Abel, andWeyl. The power of mathematical tools based on fractional calculus has attracted the attention of research community working with complex systems in physics and engineering. The association of fractional techniques with the diffusion problem represents in practice a new field of research which is reviewed in this book. This book by Evangelista and Lezi, provides an updated literature on anomalous diffusion to communicate recent consolidated advances of this research field to a wide audience of scientists. The authors have offered detailed mathematical tools of integer and fractional calculus to explore the deep significance of anomalous diffusion phenomenon. As a researcher in fractional electrodynamics myself, I am glad to say that this book uniquely provides a beautiful discussion on the significance and meaning of fractional calculus along with recent developments. This serves as a food for thought for the researchers in other areas of physics where fractional approach can be helpful in the study contemporary problems. The book has been sub-divided into three parts. The first part (chapter 1–3) of the book is dedicated to the essential physical and mathematical concepts, forming the background material on fractional calculus and diffusion phenomenon which helps the reader in the study of rest of the book. The second part of the book (chapter 4–8) provides a large number of solutions of the fractional diffusion equations arising in multiple applications in a systematic and well-organized way. The third part of the book (chapter 9–10) provides a deep exploration of the role of anomalous diffusion phenomenon in the impedance spectroscopy response of liquid samples. The usefulness of fractional diffusion equations based impedance spectroscopy model has been demonstrated by invoking some experimental data. This book is one of the most coherent and comprehensive text available to date in the area covering anomalous diffusion and its applications. It can be used as a textbook for graduate level courses, helping the reader to discover or deepen their knowledge of fractional calculus and anomalous diffusion phenomenon. In their preface, the authors slightly modified the Dante’s quotation as: ‘if the reader is slow now to believe what we shall tell, that should be no cause of wonder, for we, who saw it slightly before, remain enlightened – as we hope the reader becomes, after reading it’. I agree because I feel enlightened after reading it!",

The Blottner-Eucken-Wilke transport model is seen to underpredict the boundary-layer height, hence overpredicting the growth-rate distribution and forecasting the transition onset to occur ∼38% sooner. The other low-order transport models (Brokaw and Yos) returned very close results to the most-accurate Chapman-Enskog model.

The experiment involves fluorescent cell cycle labels so that the cell cycle is tracked in real time. This provides spatial information about the position of individual cells as well as temporal information about the cell cycle phase of each cell. Cell cycle labelling is incorporated into the reaction-diffusion model by considering the total population to be composed of two interacting subpopulations. Practical identifiability is examined using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework, confirming that the parameters are identifiable when we assume that the diffusivities of the two subpopulations are identical, but that the parameters are practically non-identifiable when we allow the diffusivities to be distinct. We also assess identifiability using a profile likelihood approach, and show that this provides similar results to MCMC with the advantage of being an order of magnitude faster to compute. Despite the profile likelihood being relatively underutilised in the mathematical biology literature, we suggest that it ought to be adopted as a screening tool to provide a rapid assessment of practical identifiability before more computationally cumbersome MCMC computations are attempted.",

Therefore, a so-called dynamic diffusion coefficient model (DDC model) is developed. To verify the suitability and accuracy of the DDC model, a series of gas diffusion experiments were conducted using coal particles of different sizes. The results show that the experimental data can be accurately described by the DDC and bidisperse models, but the fit to the DDC model is slightly better. For all coal samples, as time increases, the effective diffusion coefficient first shows a sudden drop, followed by a gradual decrease before stabilizing at longer times. The effective diffusion coefficient has a negative relationship with the size of the coal particle. Finally, the relationship between the constants of the DDC model and the effective diffusion coefficient is discussed. The constant α (μ/R 2 ) denotes the effective coefficient at the initial time, and the constants κ and β control the attenuation characteristic of the effective diffusion coefficient.",

The representation models assume distributions of numerosity either with means and SD that increase linearly with numerosity or with means that increase logarithmically with constant SD. The models produce coefficients that are applied to differences between two numerosities to produce drift rates and these drive the decision process. The linear and log models make differential predictions about how response time (RT) distributions and accuracy change with numerosity and which model is successful depends on the task. When the task is to decide which of two side-by-side arrays of dots has more dots, the log model fits decreasing accuracy and increasing RT as numerosity increases. When the task is to decide, for dots of two colors mixed in a single array, which color has more dots, the linear model fits decreasing accuracy and decreasing RT as numerosity increases. For both tasks, variables such as the areas covered by the dots affect performance, but if the task is changed to one in which the subject has to decide whether the number of dots in a single array is more or less than a standard, the variables have little effect on performance. Model parameters correlate across tasks suggesting commonalities in the abilities to perform them. Overall, results show that the representation used depends on the task and no single representation can account for the data from all the paradigms.",

The first is a generalized version of stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model with arbitrary recovery time distributions; the second is the relationship between the (latent and arbitrary) recovery time distribution, recovery hazard function, and the infection kernel of self-exciting processes; the third includes methods for simulating, fitting, evaluating and predicting the generalized process. On three large Twitter diffusion datasets, we conduct goodness-of-fit tests and holdout log-likelihood evaluation of self-exciting processes with three infection kernels --- exponential, power-law and Tsallis Q-exponential. We show that the modeling performance of the infection kernels varies with respect to the temporal structures of diffusions, and also with respect to user behavior, such as the likelihood of being bots. We further improve the prediction of popularity by combining two models that are identified as complementary by the goodness-of-fit tests.",

The diffusion matrix is neither symmetric nor positive definite, but the system possesses a formal gradient-flow or entropy structure. No growth conditions on the source terms are imposed. It is shown that any renormalized solution coincides with a strong solution with the same initial data, as long as the strong solution exists. The proof is based on the evolution of the relative entropy modified by suitable cutoff functions.",

        "abstract": "We construct theoretical models for time‐dependent swelling of coal matrix material upon adsorption of a single gas, taking into account a coupling between stress, strain, chemical potential, and diffusion. Two models are developed. The first (model A) corresponds to diffusion and hence swelling rates being controlled by the jump frequency of adsorbed molecules between closely spaced adsorption sites and the second (model B) to transport controlled by diffusion of unadsorbed molecules through diffusion paths linking distant adsorption sites. To test these models, we performed axial swelling experiments on a single 4 mm sized cylindrical sample of medium volatile bituminous coal, exposed to CH4 at pressures up to 40 MPa, at 40°C, using 1‐D, high‐pressure dilatometry. The models were calibrated to the experimental data by adjustment of a single‐valued diffusion coefficient, independent of gas pressure and adsorbed concentration. The results show that the data can be accurately explained only by model B. The implication is that the gas transport, the associated adsorption, and hence time‐dependent swelling are controlled by the diffusion of unadsorbed molecules and not by molecules jumping between the adjacent adsorption sites. Our model describes a full coupling between stress, strain, sorption, and diffusion in coal matrix material in terms of parameters that have clear physical meaning and are easily obtained from sorption and swelling experiments on coal of any rank exposed to any gas. It therefore offers an important tool for modeling permeability evolution with time during (enhanced) coalbed methane operations.",

        "abstract": "The prediction of information diffusion or cascade has attracted much attention over the last decade. Most cascade prediction works target on predicting cascade-level macroscopic properties such as the final size of a cascade. Existing microscopic cascade prediction models which focus on user-level modeling either make strong assumptions on how a user gets infected by a cascade or limit themselves to a specific scenario where \"who infected whom\" information is explicitly labeled. The strong assumptions oversimplify the complex diffusion mechanism and prevent these models from better fitting real-world cascade data. Also, the methods which focus on specific scenarios cannot be generalized to a general setting where the diffusion graph is unobserved. \nTo overcome the drawbacks of previous works, we propose a Neural Diffusion Model (NDM) for general microscopic cascade prediction. NDM makes relaxed assumptions and employs deep learning techniques including attention mechanism and convolutional network for cascade modeling. Both advantages enable our model to go beyond the limitations of previous methods, better fit the diffusion data and generalize to unseen cascades. Experimental results on diffusion prediction task over four realistic cascade datasets show that our model can achieve a relative improvement up to 26% against the best performing baseline in terms of F1 score.",

Surprisingly enough, we still do not have a clear understanding about all possible types of dynamical regimes in classical reaction–diffusion models, such as Lotka–Volterra competition models with spatial dependence. In this study, we demonstrate some new types of wave propagation and pattern formation in a classical three species cyclic competition model with spatial diffusion, which have been so far missed in the literature. These new patterns are characterized by a high regularity in space, but are different from patterns previously known to exist in reaction–diffusion models, and may have important applications in improving our understanding of biological pattern formation and invasion theory. Finding these new patterns is made technically possible by using an automatic adaptive finite element method driven by a novel a posteriori error estimate which is proved to provide a reliable bound for the error of the numerical method. We demonstrate how this numerical framework allows us to easily explore the dynamical patterns in both two and three spatial dimensions.",

        "abstract": "Computational models of classical conditioning have made significant contributions to the theoretic understanding of associative learning, yet they still struggle when the temporal aspects of conditioning are taken into account. Interval timing models have contributed a rich variety of time representations and provided accurate predictions for the timing of responses, but they usually have little to say about associative learning. In this article we present a unified model of conditioning and timing that is based on the influential Rescorla-Wagner conditioning model and the more recently developed Timing Drift-Diffusion model. We test the model by simulating 10 experimental phenomena and show that it can provide an adequate account for 8, and a partial account for the other 2. We argue that the model can account for more phenomena in the chosen set than these other similar in scope models: CSC-TD, MS-TD, Learning to Time and Modular Theory. A comparison and analysis of the mechanisms in these models is provided, with a focus on the types of time representation and associative learning rule used. Author Summary How does the time of events affect the way we learn about associations between these events? Computational models have made great contributions to our understanding of associative learning, but they usually do not perform very well when time is taken into account. Models of timing have reached high levels of accuracy in describing timed behaviour, but they usually do not have much to say about associations. A unified approach would involve combining associative learning and timing models into a single framework. This article takes just this approach. It combines the influential Rescorla-Wagner associative model with a timing model based on the Drift-Diffusion process, and shows how the resultant model can account for a number of learning and timing phenomena. The article also compares the new model to others that are similar in scope.",

Recently, an equivalent Bayesian model has been proposed. In contrast to standard DDMs, this Bayesian model directly links information in the stimulus to the decision process. Here, we extend this Bayesian model further and allow inter-trial variability of two parameters following the extended version of the DDM. We derive parameter distributions for the Bayesian model and show that they lead to predictions that are qualitatively equivalent to those made by the extended drift-diffusion model (eDDM). Further, we demonstrate the usefulness of the extended Bayesian model (eBM) for the analysis of concrete behavioral data. Specifically, using Bayesian model selection, we find evidence that including additional inter-trial parameter variability provides for a better model, when the model is constrained by trial-wise stimulus features. This result is remarkable because it was derived using just 200 trials per condition, which is typically thought to be insufficient for identifying variability parameters in DDMs. In sum, we present a Bayesian analysis, which provides for a novel and promising analysis of perceptual decision making experiments.",

Therefore, in the present research, a generalized stochastic diffusion model using Itô’s process is proposed that jointly study the product awareness and eventual adoption of an innovation. Convolution function is applied to integrate these two processes. In addition, different probability distributions are employed, which are relevant for describing the product awareness and adoption processes.

        "abstract": "Prediction of the diffusion coefficient of solute, especially bioactive molecules, in hydrogel is significant in the biomedical field. Considering the randomness of solute movement in a hydrogel network, a physical diffusion RMP-1 model based on obstruction theory was established in this study. The physical properties of the solute and the polymer chain and their interactions were introduced into this model. Furthermore, models RMP-2 and RMP-3 were established to understand and predict the diffusion behaviors of proteins in hydrogel. In addition, zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) hydrogels with wide range and fine adjustable mesh sizes were prepared and used as efficient experimental platforms for model validation. The Flory characteristic ratios, Flory-Huggins parameter, mesh size, and polymer chain radii of PSBMA hydrogels were determined. The diffusion coefficients of the proteins (bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, and lysozyme) in PSBMA hydrogels were studied by the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique. The measured diffusion coefficients were compared with the predictions of obstruction models, and it was found that our model presented an excellent predictive ability. Furthermore, the assessment of our model revealed that protein diffusion in PSBMA hydrogel would be affected by the physical properties of the protein and the PSBMA network. It was also confirmed that the diffusion behaviors of protein in zwitterionic hydrogels can be adjusted by changing the cross-linking density of the hydrogel and the ionic strength of the swelling medium. Our model is expected to possess accurate predictive ability for the diffusion coefficient of solute in hydrogel, which will be widely used in the biomedical field.",

        "abstract": "The impact of online social networks on information exchange between humans has revealed the need to study the mechanisms of information diffusion. Multiple prior works have considered empirical studies and introduced new diffusion models to understand the dynamics of the diffusion process. However, the complexity of network structures and user interactions make it challenging to model the diffusion mechanisms of online social networks and to accurately predict diffusion. In this paper, we propose an information diffusion prediction model based on a physical radiation energy transfer mechanism. The aim of this model is to predict the diffusion graph of a certain contagion throughout an interest-based community. This non-parametric model can accommodate the dynamicity of online social networks because it can receive different input diffusion parameters at different diffusion contagions. With our RADiation DIFFusion (RADDIFF) model, we precisely capture the information diffusion process from both temporal and spatial dimensions and measure the level of influence initiated by certain influencers for each diffusion process. To our knowledge, this model is the first in this domain that exploits the prediction of information networks based on a physical radiation mechanism. We conduct an extensive analysis using an experiment that includes two well-known prediction diffusion models, the linear influence model (LIM) and NETINF. The results show that RADDIFF effectively outperforms both the LIM and NETINF in terms of accuracy and the quality of forecast.",

The spatio-temporal diffusion is placed, as a matter of convenience, in the process model allowing for straightforward estimation of the diffusion parameters through Bayesian techniques. However, this method of modeling does not allow for the existence of self-excitation, or a temporal data model dependency, that has been shown to exist in criminal and terrorism data. In this manuscript we will use existing theories on how violence spreads to create models that allow for both spatio-temporal diffusion in the process model as well as temporal diffusion, or self-excitation, in the data model. We will further demonstrate how Laplace approximations similar to their use in Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation can be used to quickly and accurately conduct inference of self-exciting spatio-temporal models allowing practitioners a new way of fitting and comparing multiple process models. We will illustrate this approach by fitting a self-exciting spatio-temporal model to terrorism data in Iraq and demonstrate how choice of process model leads to differing conclusions on the existence of self-excitation in the data and differing conclusions on how violence is spreading spatio-temporally.",

        "abstract": "Background: Deep learning models are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent or one of its variants. These methods update the weights using their gradient, estimated from a small fraction of the training data. It has been observed that when using large batch sizes there is a persistent degradation in generalization performance - known as the \"generalization gap\" phenomena. Identifying the origin of this gap and closing it had remained an open problem. \nContributions: We examine the initial high learning rate training phase. We find that the weight distance from its initialization grows logarithmically with the number of weight updates. We therefore propose a \"random walk on random landscape\" statistical model which is known to exhibit similar \"ultra-slow\" diffusion behavior. Following this hypothesis we conducted experiments to show empirically that the \"generalization gap\" stems from the relatively small number of updates rather than the batch size, and can be completely eliminated by adapting the training regime used. We further investigate different techniques to train models in the large-batch regime and present a novel algorithm named \"Ghost Batch Normalization\" which enables significant decrease in the generalization gap without increasing the number of updates. To validate our findings we conduct several additional experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Finally, we reassess common practices and beliefs concerning training of deep models and suggest they may not be optimal to achieve good generalization.",

In this paper, we attempt to address the problem of identifying rumors, i.e., fake information, out of microblog posts based on their propagation structure. We firstly model microblog posts diffusion with propagation trees, which provide valuable clues on how an original message is transmitted and developed over time. We then propose a kernel-based method called Propagation Tree Kernel, which captures high-order patterns differentiating different types of rumors by evaluating the similarities between their propagation tree structures. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed kernel-based approach can detect rumors more quickly and accurately than state-of-the-art rumor detection models.",

Recent works have showed a boost of performance of these techniques when introducing the pairwise relationships between users/items in the form of graphs, and imposing smoothness priors on these graphs. However, such techniques do not fully exploit the local stationarity structures of user/item graphs, and the number of parameters to learn is linear w.r.t. the number of users and items. We propose a novel approach to overcome these limitations by using geometric deep learning on graphs. Our matrix completion architecture combines graph convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to learn meaningful statistical graph-structured patterns and the non-linear diffusion process that generates the known ratings. This neural network system requires a constant number of parameters independent of the matrix size. We apply our method on both synthetic and real datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.",

        "abstract": "Second order total variation (SOTV) models have advantages for image restoration over their ﬁrst order counterparts including their ability to remove the staircase artefact in the restored image. However, such models tend to blur the reconstructed image when discretised for numerical solution [1–5]. To overcome this drawback, we introduce a new tensor weighted second order (TWSO) model for image restoration. Speciﬁcally, we develop a novel regulariser for the SOTV model that uses the Frobenius norm of the product of the isotropic SOTV Hessian matrix and an anisotropic tensor. We then adapt the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the proposed model by breaking down the original problem into several subproblems. All the subproblems have closed-forms and can be solved eﬃciently. The proposed method is compared with state-of-the-art approaches such as tensor-based anisotropic diffusion, total generalised variation, and Euler’s elastica. We validate the proposed TWSO model using extensive experimental results on a large number of images from the Berkeley BSDS500. We also demonstrate that our method effectively reduces both the staircase and blurring effects and outperforms existing approaches for image inpainting and denoising applications. © 2017 The Author(s).

However, most existing methods produce a deterministic estimate of the clean image and are trained to minimize pixel-level distortion. These metrics are known to be poorly correlated with human perception, and often lead to unrealistic reconstructions. We present an alternative framework for blind deblurring based on conditional diffusion models. Unlike existing techniques, we train a stochastic sampler that refines the output of a deterministic predictor and is capable of producing a diverse set of plausible reconstructions for a given input. This leads to a significant improvement in perceptual quality over existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple standard benchmarks. Our predict-and-refine approach also enables much more efficient sampling compared to typical diffusion models. Combined with a carefully tuned network architecture and inference procedure, our method is competitive in terms of distortion metrics such as PSNR. These results show clear benefits of our diffusion-based method for deblurring and challenge the widely used strategy of producing a single, deterministic reconstruction.",

        "abstract": "Embedding of active substances in supramolecular systems has as the main goal to ensure the controlled release of the active ingredients. Whatever the final architecture or entrapment mechanism, modeling of release is challenging due to the moving boundary conditions and complex initial conditions. Despite huge diversity of formulations, diffusion phenomena are involved in practically all release processes. The approach in this paper starts, therefore, from mathematical methods for solving the diffusion equation in initial and boundary conditions, which are further connected with phenomenological conditions, simplified and idealized in order to lead to problems which can be analytically solved. Consequently, the release models are classified starting from the geometry of diffusion domain, initial conditions, and conditions on frontiers. Taking into account that practically all solutions of the models use the separation of variables method and integral transformation method, two specific applications of these methods are included. This paper suggests that \"good modeling practice\" of release kinetics consists essentially of identifying the most appropriate mathematical conditions corresponding to implied physicochemical phenomena. However, in most of the cases, models can be written but analytical solutions for these models cannot be obtained. Consequently, empiric models remain the first choice, and they receive an important place in the review.",

However, after about two decades of intellectual and financial investment, microstructural mapping has yet to find a single commonly accepted clinical application. Here, we suggest that slow progress in clinical translation may signify unresolved fundamental problems. We outline such problems and related practical pitfalls, as well as review strategies for developing and validating tissue microstructure models, to provoke a discussion on how to bridge the gap between our scientific aspirations and the clinical reality. We argue for recalibrating the efforts of our community toward a more systematic focus on fundamental research aimed at identifying relevant degrees of freedom affecting the measured MR signal.

It is of increasing importance for autonomous driving and draws increasing attention from the vision community. Most of the current competitive methods directly train a network to learn a mapping from sparse depth inputs to dense depth maps, which has difficulties in utilizing the 3D geometric constraints and handling the practical sensor noises. In this paper, to regularize the depth completion and improve the robustness against noise, we propose a unified CNN framework that 1) models the geometric constraints between depth and surface normal in a diffusion module and 2) predicts the confidence of sparse LiDAR measurements to mitigate the impact of noise. Specifically, our encoder-decoder backbone predicts the surface normal, coarse depth and confidence of LiDAR inputs simultaneously, which are subsequently inputted into our diffusion refinement module to obtain the final completion results. Extensive experiments on KITTI depth completion dataset and NYU-Depth-V2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Further ablation study and analysis give more insights into the proposed components and demonstrate the generalization capability and stability of our model.",

The assorted results, many of which are applicable to simulations of nonbiological membranes, highlight the limitations of the homogeneous solubility diffusion model; support the utility of inhomogeneous solubility diffusion and compartmental models; underscore the need for comparison with experiment for both simple solvent systems (such as water/hexadecane) and well-characterized membranes; and demonstrate the need for microsecond simulations for even simple permeants like water and oxygen. Undulations, subdiffusion, fractional viscosity dependence, periodic boundary conditions, and recent developments in the field are also discussed.

Models for hydraulic fracturing–induced earthquakes in shales typically ascribe fault activation to elevated pore pressure or increased shear stress; however, these mechanisms are incompatible with experiments and rate-state frictional models, which predict stable sliding (aseismic slip) on faults that penetrate rocks with high clay or total organic carbon. Recent studies further indicate that the earthquakes tend to nucleate over relatively short injection time scales and sufficiently far from the injection zone that triggering by either poroelastic stress changes or pore pressure diffusion is unlikely. Here, we invoke an alternative model based on recent laboratory and in situ experiments, wherein distal, unstable regions of a fault are progressively loaded by aseismic slip on proximal, stable regions stimulated by hydraulic fracturing. This model predicts that dynamic rupture initiates when the creep front impinges on a fault region where rock composition favors dynamic and slip rate weakening behavior.",

        "abstract": "Significance We examine the effects of an uneven population distribution on the spread of the COVID-19 disease spread, using a diffusion model based on interpersonal contact networks. Taking into account spatial heterogeneity, the spread of COVID-19 is much “burstier” than in standard epidemiological models, with substantial local disparities in timing and severity and long lags between local outbreaks. We show that spatial heterogeneity may produce dramatic differences in social exposures to those with the illness, and may stress health care delivery systems in ways that are not well captured by standard SIR-like models. Standard epidemiological models for COVID-19 employ variants of compartment (SIR or susceptible–infectious–recovered) models at local scales, implicitly assuming spatially uniform local mixing. Here, we examine the effect of employing more geographically detailed diffusion models based on known spatial features of interpersonal networks, most particularly the presence of a long-tailed but monotone decline in the probability of interaction with distance, on disease diffusion. Based on simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 US cities, we conclude that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential for spatial network structure to generate highly nonuniform diffusion behavior even at the scale of cities, and suggest the importance of incorporating such structure when designing models to inform health care planning, predict community outcomes, or identify potential disparities.",

        "abstract": "It has recently become possible to study the dynamics of information diffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online platforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using ‘social bots’ deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved marketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network intervention techniques.",

        "abstract": "We present a probabilistic language model for time-stamped text data which tracks the semantic evolution of individual words over time. The model represents words and contexts by latent trajectories in an embedding space. At each moment in time, the embedding vectors are inferred from a probabilistic version of word2vec [Mikolov et al., 2013]. These embedding vectors are connected in time through a latent diffusion process. We describe two scalable variational inference algorithms--skip-gram smoothing and skip-gram filtering--that allow us to train the model jointly over all times; thus learning on all data while simultaneously allowing word and context vectors to drift. Experimental results on three different corpora demonstrate that our dynamic model infers word embedding trajectories that are more interpretable and lead to higher predictive likelihoods than competing methods that are based on static models trained separately on time slices.",

        "abstract": "Many independent studies in social robotics and human–robot interaction have gained knowledge on various factors that affect people’s perceptions of and behaviors toward robots. However, only a few of those studies aimed to develop models of social robot acceptance integrating a wider range of such factors. With the rise of robotic technologies for everyday environments, such comprehensive research on relevant acceptance factors is increasingly necessary. This article presents a conceptual model of social robot acceptance with a strong theoretical base, which has been tested among the general Dutch population (n = 1,168) using structural equation modeling. The results show a strong role of normative believes that both directly and indirectly affect the anticipated acceptance of social robots for domestic purposes. Moreover, the data show that, at least at this stage of diffusion within society, people seem somewhat reluctant to accept social behaviors from robots. The current findings of our study and the...",

We will provide worked out examples using the kmos code, where we highlight the central approximations made in implementing a KMC model as well as possible pitfalls. This includes the mapping of the problem onto a lattice and the derivation of rate constant expressions for various elementary processes. Example KMC models will be presented within the application areas surface diffusion, crystal growth and heterogeneous catalysis, covering both transient and steady-state kinetics as well as the preparation of various initial states of the system. We highlight the sensitivity of KMC models to the elementary processes included, as well as to possible errors in the rate constants. For catalysis models in particular, a recurrent challenge is the occurrence of processes at very different timescales, e.g., fast diffusion processes and slow chemical reactions. We demonstrate how to overcome this timescale disparity problem using recently developed acceleration algorithms. Finally, we will discuss how to account for lateral interactions between the species adsorbed to the lattice, which can play an important role in all application areas covered here.",

In an unbounded medium with a cylindrical hole, the built model has been applied to examine the influence of the coupling between temperature and mass diffusion and responses. At constant concentration as well as intermittent and decaying varying heat, the surrounding cavity surface is traction-free and is filled slowly. Laplace transform and Laplace inversion techniques are applied to obtain the solutions of the studied field variables. In order to explore thermal diffusion analysis and find closed solutions, a suitable numerical approximation technique has been used. Comparisons are made between the results obtained with the results of the corresponding previous models.

Through extensive experiments, we showcase on a drum sound generation task the numerous sampling schemes offered by our method (unconditional generation, deterministic generation, inpainting, interpolation, variations, class-conditional sampling) and propose the class-mixing sampling, a novel way to generate\"hybrid\"sounds.

High specific surface areas (SSAs) of 1782 m2 g−1 and micro/mesoporous structures of the PACFs were obtained by optimizing the preparation conditions of the PANF-based pre-oxidized fibers (PANOFs)/KOH ratio of 1 : 2 and an activation temperature of 800 °C. The as-prepared PACFs exhibited flexibility and endless forms, and sorption capacities of 1.52 mmol g−1 for PFOS and 0.73 mmol g−1 for PFOA, much higher than the commercially available coal-based powder activated carbon (PAC) and granular activated carbon (GAC), which was also indicated by the site energy distributions. The sorption system followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model and a Freundlich isotherm model. The intra-particle diffusion and Boy’s film-diffusion models were also used to verify that intra-particle diffusion is the main rate-controlling step. It was assumed that the multilayer sorption most probably occurs through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction, and some micelles and hemi-micelles form on the ACF surfaces. The PACFs show good reusability over five sorption–desorption cycle studies.",

Conventional methods for cascade prediction heavily depend on the hypothesis of diffusion models, e.g., independent cascade model and linear threshold model. Recently, researchers attempt to circumvent the problem of cascade prediction using sequential models (e.g., recurrent neural network, namely RNN) that do not require knowing the underlying diffusion model. Existing sequential models employ a chain structure to capture the memory effect. However, for cascade prediction, each cascade generally corresponds to a diffusion tree, causing cross-dependence in cascade— one sharing behavior could be triggered by its non-immediate predecessor in the memory chain. In this paper, we propose to an attention-based RNN to capture the cross-dependence in cascade. Furthermore, we introduce a coverage strategy to combat the misallocation of attention caused by the memoryless of traditional attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets demonstrate the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art models at both cascade prediction and inferring diffusion tree.",

In real datasets, the score function diverges as the diffusion time ( t ) decreases to zero, and this observation leads an argument that the score estimation fails at t = 0 with any neural network structure. Subsequently, we introduce Unbounded Diffusion Model (UDM) that resolves the score diverging problem with an easily applicable modiﬁcation to any diffusion models. Additionally, we introduce a new SDE that overcomes the theoretic and practical limitations of Variance Exploding SDE. On top of that, the introduced Soft Truncation method improves the sample quality by mitigating the loss scale issue that happens at t = 0 .

A nonlocal integral term involving space is a traditional way to incorporate spatial memory, but the actual spatial memory should depend on past information so that delay naturally arises. We propose a new consumer‐resource model with random and memory‐based diffusions in which the resource species has no memory or cognition, whereas the consumer species has spatial memory. By using the memory‐based diffusion coefficient and the averaged memory period of the consumer as the control parameters, we find Hopf bifurcations and stability switches occur and spatially nonhomogeneous periodic solutions are generated. It is well known that prey‐taxis enhances the stability of a homogeneous coexistence state in a predator–prey system, and here we show that memory‐based prey‐taxis can destabilize a constant coexistence and generate complex spatiotemporal pattern formation. Using the obtained theoretical results, we study the impact of the memory‐based diffusion on the consumer‐resource dynamics with Holling type‐I and type‐II functional responses.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The capacity fade of modern lithium ion batteries is mainly caused by the formation and growth of the solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI). Numerous continuum models support its understanding and mitigation by studying SEI growth during battery storage. However, only a few electrochemical models discuss SEI growth during battery operation. In this article, a continuum model is developed that consistently captures the influence of open‐circuit potential, current direction, current magnitude, and cycle number on the growth of the SEI. The model is based on the formation and diffusion of neutral lithium atoms, which carry electrons through the SEI. Recent short‐ and long‐term experiments provide validation for our model. SEI growth is limited by either reaction, diffusion, or migration. For the first time, the transition between these mechanisms is modelled. Thereby, an explanation is provided for the fading of capacity with time t of the form t β with the scaling coefficent β, 0≤β≤1. Based on the model, critical operation conditions accelerating SEI growth are identified.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic patterning of specific proteins is essential for the spatio-temporal regulation of many important intracellular processes in prokaryotes, eukaryotes and multicellular organisms. The emergence of patterns generated by interactions of diffusing proteins is a paradigmatic example for self-organization. In this article, we review quantitative models for intracellular Min protein patterns in Escherichia coli, Cdc42 polarization in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the bipolar PAR protein patterns found in Caenorhabditis elegans. By analysing the molecular processes driving these systems we derive a theoretical perspective on general principles underlying self-organized pattern formation. We argue that intracellular pattern formation is not captured by concepts such as ‘activators’, ‘inhibitors’ or ‘substrate depletion’. Instead, intracellular pattern formation is based on the redistribution of proteins by cytosolic diffusion, and the cycling of proteins between distinct conformational states. Therefore, mass-conserving reaction–diffusion equations provide the most appropriate framework to study intracellular pattern formation. We conclude that directed transport, e.g. cytosolic diffusion along an actively maintained cytosolic gradient, is the key process underlying pattern formation. Thus the basic principle of self-organization is the establishment and maintenance of directed transport by intracellular protein dynamics. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Self-organization in cell biology’.",

        "abstract": "The prion hypothesis states that misfolded proteins can act as infectious agents that trigger the misfolding and aggregation of healthy proteins to transmit a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Increasing evidence suggests that pathogenic proteins in Alzheimer’s disease adapt prion-like mechanisms and spread across the brain along an anatomically connected network. Local kinetics models of protein misfolding and global network models of protein diffusion provide valuable insight into the dynamics of prion-like diseases. Yet, to date, these models have not been combined to simulate how pathological proteins multiply and spread across the human brain. Here we model the prion-like spreading of Alzheimer’s disease by combining misfolding kinetics and network diffusion through a connectivity-weighted Laplacian graph created from 418 brains of the Human Connectome Project. The nodes of the graph represent anatomic regions of interest and the edges represent their con-nectivity, weighted by the mean fiber number divided by the mean fiber length. We show that our brain network model correctly predicts the neuropathological pattern of Alzheimer’s disease and captures the key characteristic features of whole brain models at a fraction of their computational cost. To illustrate the potential of brain network modeling in neurodegeneration, we simulate biomarker curves, infection times, and two promising therapeutic strategies to delay the onset of neurodegeneration: reduced production and increased clearance of misfolded protein.

        "abstract": "Significance Today, vast areas of drylands in semiarid climates face the dangers of desertification. To understand the driving mechanisms behind this effect, many theoretical models have been created. These models provide insight into the resilience of dryland ecosystems. However, until now, comparisons with reality were merely visual. In this article, a systematic comparison is performed using data on wavenumber, biomass, and migration speed of vegetation patterns in Somalia. In agreement with reaction–diffusion models, a wide distribution of regular pattern wavenumbers was found in the data. This highlights the potential for extrapolating predictions of those models to real ecosystems, including those that elucidate how spatial self-organization of vegetation enhances ecosystem resilience. Spatial self-organization of dryland vegetation constitutes one of the most promising indicators for an ecosystem’s proximity to desertification. This insight is based on studies of reaction–diffusion models that reproduce visual characteristics of vegetation patterns observed on aerial photographs. However, until now, the development of reliable early warning systems has been hampered by the lack of more in-depth comparisons between model predictions and real ecosystem patterns. In this paper, we combined topographical data, (remotely sensed) optical data, and in situ biomass measurements from two sites in Somalia to generate a multilevel description of dryland vegetation patterns. We performed an in-depth comparison between these observed vegetation pattern characteristics and predictions made by the extended-Klausmeier model for dryland vegetation patterning. Consistent with model predictions, we found that for a given topography, there is multistability of ecosystem states with different pattern wavenumbers. Furthermore, observations corroborated model predictions regarding the relationships between pattern wavenumber, total biomass, and maximum biomass. In contrast, model predictions regarding the role of slope angles were not corroborated by the empirical data, suggesting that inclusion of small-scale topographical heterogeneity is a promising avenue for future model development. Our findings suggest that patterned dryland ecosystems may be more resilient to environmental change than previously anticipated, but this enhanced resilience crucially depends on the adaptive capacity of vegetation patterns.",

The Deep Neural Networks are seducing tools for classification of subjects' imaging data in computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The major problem here is the lack of a publicly available large amount of training data in both modalities. The lack number of training data yields over-fitting phenomena. We propose a method of a cross-modal transfer learning: from Structural MRI to Diffusion Tensor Imaging modality. Models pre-trained on a structural MRI dataset with domain-depended data augmentation are used as initialization of network parameters to train on Mean Diffusivity data. The method shows a reduction of the over-fitting phenomena, improves learning performance, and thus increases the accuracy of prediction.

Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks~(GCN) have shown promising results by modeling the information diffusion process in graphs that leverage both graph structure and node feature information. To this end, in this paper, we propose an effective graph convolutional neural network based model for social recommendation. Based on a classical CF model, the key idea of our proposed model is that we borrow the strengths of GCNs to capture how users' preferences are influenced by the social diffusion process in social networks. The diffusion of users' preferences is built on a layer-wise diffusion manner, with the initial user embedding as a function of the current user's features and a free base user latent vector that is not contained in the user feature. Similarly, each item's latent vector is also a combination of the item's free latent vector, as well as its feature representation. Furthermore, we show that our proposed model is flexible when user and item features are not available. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model.",

We provide a unifying perspective of these techniques as minimum Stein discrepancy estimators, and use this lens to design new diffusion kernel Stein discrepancy (DKSD) and diffusion score matching (DSM) estimators with complementary strengths. We establish the consistency, asymptotic normality, and robustness of DKSD and DSM estimators, then derive stochastic Riemannian gradient descent algorithms for their efficient optimisation. The main strength of our methodology is its flexibility, which allows us to design estimators with desirable properties for specific models at hand by carefully selecting a Stein discrepancy. We illustrate this advantage for several challenging problems for score matching, such as non-smooth, heavy-tailed or light-tailed densities.",

Because most studies for new technologies rely on stated preference (SP) data, market share predictions will reflect shares in the SP data and not in the real market. Moreover, typical disaggregate demand models are suitable to forecast demand in relatively stable markets, but show limitations in the case of innovations. When predicting the market for new products it is crucial to account for the role played by innovation and how it penetrates the new market over time through a diffusion process. However, typical diffusion models in marketing research use fairly simple demand models. In this paper we discuss the problem of predicting market shares for new products and suggest a method that combines advanced choice models with a diffusion model to take into account that new products often need time to gain a significant market share.

In this setting, mixing is a purely advective effect that causes a transfer of energy to high frequencies. When diffusion is present, mixing enhances the dissipative forces. This phenomenon is referred to as enhanced dissipation, namely the identification of a timescale faster than the purely diffusive one. We establish a precise connection between quantitative mixing rates in terms of decay of negative Sobolev norms and enhanced dissipation timescales. The proofs are based on a contradiction argument that takes advantage of the cascading mechanism due to mixing, an estimate of the distance between the inviscid and viscous dynamics, and an optimization step in the frequency cutoff.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Models that simulate the evolution of polar firn are important for several applications in glaciology, including converting ice-sheet elevation change measurements to mass change and interpreting climate records in ice cores. We have developed the Community Firn Model (CFM), an open-source, modular model framework designed to simulate numerous physical processes in firn. The modules include firn densification, heat transport, meltwater percolation and refreezing, water isotope diffusion, and firn-air diffusion. The CFM is designed so that new modules can be added with ease. In this paper, we first describe the CFM and its modules. We then demonstrate the CFM's usefulness in two model applications that utilize two of its novel aspects. The CFM currently has the ability to run any of 13 previously published firn densification models, and in the first application we compare those models' results when they are forced with regional climate model outputs for Summit, Greenland. The results show that the models do not agree well (spread greater than 10 %) when predicting depth-integrated porosity, firn age, or the trend in surface elevation change. In the second application, we show that the CFM's coupled firn-air and firn densification models can simulate noble gas records from an ice core better than a firn-air model alone.\n",

We use PDEs in addition to measurements to train DNNs to approximate unknown parameters and constitutive relationships as well as states. The proposed approach increases the accuracy of DNN approximations of partially known functions when a limited number of measurements is available and allows for training DNNs when no direct measurements of the functions of interest are available. We employ physics informed DNNs to estimate the unknown space-dependent diffusion coefficient in a linear diffusion equation and an unknown constitutive relationship in a non-linear diffusion equation. For the parameter estimation problem, we assume that partial measurements of the coefficient and states are available and demonstrate that under these conditions, the proposed method is more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. For the non-linear diffusion PDE model with a fully unknown constitutive relationship (i.e., no measurements of constitutive relationship are available), the physics informed DNN method can accurately estimate the non-linear constitutive relationship based on state measurements only. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method remains accurate in the presence of measurement noise.",

Extensions to Lewis’ past work on discrete dividends and spectral expansion for jump diffusion are presented.

Motivated by the recent criticism on diffusion models and the galloping advancements in influence learning, we propose IMINFECTOR (Influence Maximization with INFluencer vECTORs), a method that uses representations learned from diffusion cascades to perform model-independent influence maximization. The first part of our methodology is a multi-task neural network that learns embeddings of nodes that initiate cascades (influencer vectors) and embeddings of nodes that participate in them (susceptible vectors). The norm of an influencer vector captures a node’s aptitude to initiate lengthy cascades and is used to reduce the number of candidate seeds. The combination of influencer and susceptible vectors form the diffusion probabilities between nodes. These are used to reformulate the computation of the influence spread and propose a greedy solution to influence maximization that retains the theoretical guarantees. We apply our method in three sizable datasets and evaluate it using cascades from future time steps. IMINFECTOR’s scalability and accuracy outperform various competitive algorithms and metrics from the diverse landscape of influence maximization.",

This is particularly true for vector-borne diseases because vector populations can be strongly affected by host distribution as well as by climatic and landscape variables. Here, we aim to identify environmental drivers for bluetongue virus (BTV), the causative agent of a major vector-borne disease of ruminants that has emerged multiple times in Europe in recent decades. In order to determine the importance of climatic, landscape and host-related factors affecting BTV diffusion across Europe, we fitted different phylogeographic models to a dataset of 113 time-stamped and geo-referenced BTV genomes, representing multiple strains and serotypes. Diffusion models using continuous space revealed that terrestrial habitat below 300 m altitude, wind direction and higher livestock densities were associated with faster BTV movement. Results of discrete phylogeographic analysis involving generalized linear models broadly supported these findings, but varied considerably with the level of spatial partitioning. Contrary to common perception, we found no evidence for average temperature having a positive effect on BTV diffusion, though both methodological and biological reasons could be responsible for this result. Our study provides important insights into the drivers of BTV transmission at the landscape scale that could inform predictive models of viral spread and have implications for designing control strategies.",

The model couples a system of kinetic transport equations describing a population of commuters moving on a large scale (extra-urban) with a system of diffusion equations characterizing the non-commuting population acting over a small scale (urban). The modeling approach permits to avoid unrealistic effects of traditional diffusion models in epidemiology, like infinite propagation speed on large scales and mass migration dynamics. A construction based on the transport formalism of kinetic theory allows to give a clear model interpretation to the interactions between infected and susceptible in compartmental space-dependent models. In addition, in a suitable scaling limit, our approach permits to couple the two populations through a consistent diffusion model acting at the urban scale. A discretization of the system based on finite volumes on unstructured grids, combined with an asymptotic preserving method in time, shows that the model is able to describe correctly the main features of the spatial expansion of an epidemic. An application to the initial spread of COVID-19 is finally presented.",

        "abstract": "Transport properties and hydration behavior of phosphoric acid/(benz)imidazole mixtures are investigated by diverse NMR techniques, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and conductivity measurements. The monomeric systems can serve as models for phosphoric acid/poly-benzimidazole membranes which are known for their exceptional performance in high temperature PEM fuel cells. 1H- and 31P-NMR data show benzimidazole acting as a strong Brønsted base with respect to neat phosphoric acid. Since benzimidazole's nitrogens are fully protonated with a low rate for proton exchange with phosphate species, proton diffusion and conduction processes must take place within the hydrogen bond network of phosphoric acid only. The proton exchange dynamics between phosphate and benzimidazole species pass through the intermediate exchange regime (with respect to NMR line separations) with exchange times being close to typical diffusion times chosen in PFG-NMR diffusion measurements (ms regime). The resulting effects, as described by the Kärger equation, are included into the evaluation of PFG-NMR data for obtaining precise proton diffusion coefficients. The highly reduced proton diffusion coefficient within the phosphoric acid part of the model systems compared to neat phosphoric acid is suggested to be the immediate consequence of proton subtraction from phosphoric acid. This reduces hydrogen bond network frustration (imbalance of the number of proton donors and acceptors) and therefore also the rate of structural proton diffusion, phosphoric acid's acidity and hygroscopicity. Reduced water uptake, shown by TGA, goes along with reduced electroosmotic water drag which is suggested to be the reason for PBI-phosphoric acid membranes performing better in fuel cells than other phosphoric-acid-containing electrolytes with higher protonic conductivity.",

While viscoelastic anomalous diffusion is typically modelled by a Gaussian process with correlated increments, so-called fractional Gaussian noise, an increasing number of systems are reported, in which viscoelastic anomalous diffusion is paired with non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Following recent advances in Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion we here introduce and discuss several possible versions of random-diffusivity models with long-ranged correlations. While all these models show a crossover from non-Gaussian to Gaussian distributions beyond some correlation time, their mean squared displacements exhibit strikingly different behaviours: depending on the model crossovers from anomalous to normal diffusion are observed, as well as a priori unexpected dependencies of the effective diffusion coefficient on the correlation exponent. Our observations of the non-universality of random-diffusivity viscoelastic anomalous diffusion are important for the analysis of experiments and a better understanding of the physical origins of ‘viscoelastic yet non-Gaussian’ diffusion.",

On the basis of SEM pictures, the mean particles size of the hydrochar was determined, and it could be demonstrated that the growth of the particles is not directly related to the formation rate of hydrochar or the decreasing rate of the intermediates concentration in the aqueous solution. Four additives (salts) have been tested, and the results point out that the ionic strength is an important factor to control the particle size. Together, these observations lead to the conclusion that coalescence is an important driver for the growth of the particles and that a LaMer-like nucleation followed by diffusion-controlled growth is unlikely to be the formation and growth mechanism of hydrochar.",

        "abstract": "Motivation: Smoldyn is a spatial and stochastic biochemical simulator. It treats each molecule of interest as an individual particle in continuous space, simulating molecular diffusion, molecule‐membrane interactions and chemical reactions, all with good accuracy. This article presents several new features. Results: Smoldyn now supports two types of rule‐based modeling. These are a wildcard method, which is very convenient, and the BioNetGen package with extensions for spatial simulation, which is better for complicated models. Smoldyn also includes new algorithms for simulating the diffusion of surface‐bound molecules and molecules with excluded volume. Both are exact in the limit of short time steps and reasonably good with longer steps. In addition, Smoldyn supports single‐molecule tracking simulations. Finally, the Smoldyn source code can be accessed through a C/C ++ language library interface.

This is the result of extensive comparisons, over the last several years, of computer simulations of increasing accuracy and scale, experiments, and continuum models, in a variety of flows and for a variety of mixtures. Computer simulations-discrete element methods (DEM)-yield remarkably detailed views of granular flow and segregation. Conti-nuum models, however, offer the best possibility for parametric studies of outcomes in what could be a prohibitively large space resulting from the competition between three distinct driving mechanisms: advection, diffusion, and segregation. We present a continuum transport equation-based framework, informed by phenomenological constitutive equations, that accurately predicts segregation in many settings, both industrial and natural. Three-way comparisons among experiments, DEM, and theory are offered wherever possible to validate the approach. In addition to the flows and mixtures described here, many straightforward extensions of the framework appear possible.",

        "abstract": "The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) telescope recently observed extended emission around the Geminga and PSR B0656+14 pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). These observations have been used to estimate cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion coefficients near the PWNe that appear to be more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the diffusion coefficients typically derived for the interstellar medium from measured abundances of secondary species in CRs. Two-zone diffusion models have been proposed as a solution to this discrepancy, where the slower diffusion zone (SDZ) is confined to a small region around the PWN. Such models are shown to successfully reproduce the HAWC observations of the Geminga PWN while retaining consistency with other CR data. It is found that the size of the SDZ influences the predicted positron flux and the spectral shape of the extended γ-ray emission at lower energies that can be observed with the Fermi Large Area Telescope. If the two observed PWNe are not unique, then it is likely that there are similar pockets of slow diffusion around many CR sources elsewhere in the Milky Way. The consequences of such a picture for Galactic CR propagation is explored.",

        "abstract": "Effectively modeling and predicting the information cascades is at the core of understanding the information diffusion, which is essential for many related downstream applications, such as fake news detection and viral marketing identification. Conventional methods for cascade prediction heavily depend on the hypothesis of diffusion models and hand-crafted features. Owing to the significant recent successes of deep learning in multiple domains, attempts have been made to predict cascades by developing neural networks based approaches. However, the existing models are not capable of capturing both the underlying structure of a cascade graph and the node sequence in the diffusion process which, in turn, results in unsatisfactory prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a deep multi-task learning framework with a novel design of shared-representation layer to aid in explicitly understanding and predicting the cascades. As it turns out, the learned latent representation from the shared-representation layer can encode the structure and the node sequence of the cascade very well. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the prediction accuracy and reduce the computational cost compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

We have analyzed the adsorption of Congo red as a function of dye concentration, time, and temperature and measured a Congo red adsorption capacity of 1735 mg g-1 for the amorphous iron nanoparticles. To our knowledge, this is the highest value reported so far for Congo red adsorption. The acquired data have been evaluated applying various models for adsorption kinetics and thermodynamic studies. The isotherm models as well as acquired Fourier transform infrared spectra suggest that both chemi- and physisorption occur for Congo red adsorption on iron nanoparticles, where chemisorption appears to be dominant. The kinetics of adsorption of Congo red on both bcc-structured and amorphous iron follow a pseudo-second order equation and are characterized by high initial adsorption rates. Diffusion studies indicate that adsorption occurs in two stages, namely film diffusion followed by intraparticle diffusion. Our studies show that amorphous iron nanoparticles are highly promising for dye adsorption and wastewater treatment applications.",

Here, we used drift-diffusion models combined with model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, effective connectivity, and multivariate pattern analysis to characterize the neuro-computational architecture of value-based decisions. We found that 2 key drift-diffusion computations at the selection stage, namely integration and choice readout, engage distinct brain regions, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex integrating a decision value signal computed in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior parietal cortex reading out choice outcomes. Our findings suggest that this prefronto-parietal network acts as a hub implementing behavioral selection through a distributed drift-diffusion process.",

        "abstract": "Significance Pattern formation is a central question in developmental biology. Alan Turing proposed that this could be achieved by a diffusion-driven instability in a monophasic system consisting of two reacting chemicals. In this paper, we extend Turing’s work to a more realistic mechanochemical model of multicellular tissue, modeling also its biphasic and mechanical properties. Overcoming limitations of conventional reaction–diffusion models, we show that mechanochemical couplings between morphogen concentrations and extracellular fluid flows provide alternative, non-Turing, mechanisms by which tissues can form robust spatial patterns. The formation of self-organized patterns is key to the morphogenesis of multicellular organisms, although a comprehensive theory of biological pattern formation is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model combining tissue mechanics with morphogen turnover and transport to explore routes to patterning. Our active description couples morphogen reaction and diffusion, which impact cell differentiation and tissue mechanics, to a two-phase poroelastic rheology, where one tissue phase consists of a poroelastic cell network and the other one of a permeating extracellular fluid, which provides a feedback by actively transporting morphogens. While this model encompasses previous theories approximating tissues to inert monophasic media, such as Turing’s reaction–diffusion model, it overcomes some of their key limitations permitting pattern formation via any two-species biochemical kinetics due to mechanically induced cross-diffusion flows. Moreover, we describe a qualitatively different advection-driven Keller–Segel instability which allows for the formation of patterns with a single morphogen and whose fundamental mode pattern robustly scales with tissue size. We discuss the potential relevance of these findings for tissue morphogenesis.",

However, limited understanding of its deposition process greatly hinders the future growth of the technology. In order to optimise and control the deposition process, modelling and predicting the thermal behaviour change of the material during such a process is required. In this paper, the thermal behaviour of FDM process was studied both experimentally and numerically; effects of nozzle temperature, platform temperature, extrusion speed, and layer thickness on effective diffusion time, maximum vertical distortion, and maximum thermal stress were evaluated. It is shown that the developed simulation model could predict the effective diffusion time with the error of less than 13% in 6 out of 9 experimental conditions, relatively lower than the existing simulation and theoretical prediction models. Both the experimental and numerical results suggested that polylactic acid would have the longest diffusion time at high nozzle temperature, high platform temperature, low printing speed, and high layer thickness. And the numerical model revealed that reducing extrusion temperature, slowing printing speed, decreasing layer thickness are beneficial of reducing the vertical distortion and residual thermal stress.",

We investigate CR feedback in non-cosmological simulations of dwarf, sub-L⋆ starburst, and L⋆ galaxies with different propagation models, including advection, isotropic, and anisotropic diffusion, and streaming along field lines with different transport coefficients. We simulate CR diffusion and streaming simultaneously in galaxies with high resolution, using a two-moment method. We forward-model and compare to observations of γ-ray emission from nearby and starburst galaxies. We reproduce the γ-ray observations of dwarf and L⋆ galaxies with constant isotropic diffusion coefficient $\\kappa \\sim 3\\times 10^{29}\\, {\\rm cm^{2}\\, s^{-1}}$. Advection-only and streaming-only models produce order of magnitude too large γ-ray luminosities in dwarf and L⋆ galaxies. We show that in models that match the γ-ray observations, most CRs escape low-gas-density galaxies (e.g. dwarfs) before significant collisional losses, while starburst galaxies are CR proton calorimeters. While adiabatic losses can be significant, they occur only after CRs escape galaxies, so they are only of secondary importance for γ-ray emissivities. Models where CRs are ‘trapped’ in the star-forming disc have lower star formation efficiency, but these models are ruled out by γ-ray observations. For models with constant κ that match the γ-ray observations, CRs form extended haloes with scale heights of several kpc to several tens of kpc.",

        "abstract": "&NA; The evolution of quantitative characters over long timescales is often studied using stochastic diffusion models. The current toolbox available to students of macroevolution is however limited to two main models: Brownian motion and the Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck process, plus some of their extensions. Here, we present a very general model for inferring the dynamics of quantitative characters evolving under both random diffusion and deterministic forces of any possible shape and strength, which can accommodate interesting evolutionary scenarios like directional trends, disruptive selection, or macroevolutionary landscapes with multiple peaks. This model is based on a general partial differential equation widely used in statistical mechanics: the Fokker‐Planck equation, also known in population genetics as the Kolmogorov forward equation. We thus call the model FPK, for Fokker‐Planck‐Kolmogorov. We first explain how this model can be used to describe macroevolutionary landscapes over which quantitative traits evolve and, more importantly, we detail how it can be fitted to empirical data. Using simulations, we show that the model has good behavior both in terms of discrimination from alternative models and in terms of parameter inference. We provide R code to fit the model to empirical data using either maximum‐likelihood or Bayesian estimation, and illustrate the use of this code with two empirical examples of body mass evolution in mammals. FPK should greatly expand the set of macroevolutionary scenarios that can be studied since it opens the way to estimating macroevolutionary landscapes of any conceivable shape.

A linear correlation of the solar modulation parameter with solar activities is assumed to account for the time-varying cosmic ray fluxes. A comprehensive set of propagation models, with/without reacceleration or convection, have been discussed and compared. We find that only the models with reacceleration can self-consistently fit both the proton and B/C data. The rigidity dependence slope of the diffusion coefficient, $\\delta$, is found to be about $0.38-0.50$ for the diffusion-reacceleration models. The plain diffusion and diffusion-convection models fit the data poorly. We compare different model predictions of the positron and antiproton fluxes with the data. We find that the diffusion-reacceleration models over-produce low energy positrons, while non-reacceleration models give better fit to the data. As for antiprotons, reacceleration models tend to under-predict low energy antiproton fluxes, unless a phenomenological modification of the velocity-dependence of the diffusion coefficient is applied.

        "abstract": "Trans‐neuronal propagation of mutant huntingtin protein contributes to the organised spread of cortico‐striatal degeneration and disconnection in Huntington's disease (HD). We investigated whether the network diffusion model, which models transneuronal spread as diffusion of pathological proteins via the brain connectome, can determine the severity of neural degeneration and disconnection in HD. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high‐angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data from symptomatic Huntington's disease (HD) (N = 26) and age‐matched healthy controls (N = 26) to measure neural degeneration and disconnection in HD. The network diffusion model was used to test whether disease spread, via the human brain connectome, is a viable mechanism to explain the distribution of pathology across the brain. We found that an eigenmode identified in the healthy human brain connectome Laplacian matrix, accurately predicts the cortico‐striatal spatial pattern of degeneration in HD. Furthermore, the spread of neural degeneration from sub‐cortical brain regions, including the accumbens and thalamus, generates a spatial pattern which represents the typical neurodegenerative characteristics in HD. The white matter connections connecting the nodes with the highest amount of disease factors, when diffusion based disease spread is initiated from the striatum, were found to be most vulnerable to disconnection in HD. These findings suggest that trans‐neuronal diffusion of mutant huntingtin protein across the human brain connectome may explain the pattern of gray matter degeneration and white matter disconnection that are hallmarks of HD.",

The impregnated molecular amine zeolite composite was characterized and CO2 adsorption performance was investigated through TGA in the presence of atmospheric pure CO2 gas at 25, 50, 75, and 100 °C, respectively, using 20–80 wt % of PEI-loaded zeolite 13X adsorbents. This paper reports on the effects of temperature and amine (PEI) loading on CO2 adsorption capacity and estimated kinetic parameters through modeling of selected models which represent the reaction rate and diffusion rate models. The studied adsorbents showed the highest adsorption capacity at 75 °C with 60 wt % PEI loading. Thus, the optimum temperature of 75 °C and optimal loading of 60 wt % was observed from the current studies for CO2 capture. From modeling study, it was found that Avrami’s fractional order and dual kinetic models (DKM) described well the adsorption behavior of CO2 on PEI-impregnated zeolite 13X at all temperatures accurately and up to 75 °C, respectively. Besides, intraparticle diffusion was found to be the rate-limiting step when compared with the film diffusion model.",

Flow models are often over-simplified, assuming one-dimensional diffusion with constant drift. However, diffusion and flow are usually encountered in three-dimensional bounded environments where the flow is highly non-uniform such as in blood vessels or microfluidic channels. For a qualitative understanding of the relevant physical effects inherent to these channels, based on the Péclet number and the transmitter-receiver distance, we study when simplified models of uniform flow and advection-only transport are applicable. For these two regimes, analytical expressions for the channel impulse response are derived and validated by particle-based simulation. Furthermore, as advection-only transport is typically overlooked and hence not analyzed in the molecular communication literature, we evaluate the symbol error rate for exemplary on-off keying as performance metric.",

We have extended the code capabilities implementing ion–neutral interaction effects using the generalized Ohm’s law, i.e., we include the Hall term and the ambipolar diffusion (Pedersen dissipation) in the induction equation. Our models span from the upper convection zone to the corona, with the photosphere, chromosphere, and transition region partially ionized. Our simulations reveal that the interactions between ionized particles and neutral particles have important consequences for the magnetothermodynamics of these modeled layers: (1) ambipolar diffusion increases the temperature in the chromosphere; (2) sporadically the horizontal magnetic field in the photosphere is diffused into the chromosphere, due to the large ambipolar diffusion; (3) ambipolar diffusion concentrates electrical currents, leading to more violent jets and reconnection processes, resulting in (3a) the formation of longer and faster spicules, (3b) heating of plasma during the spicule evolution, and (3c) decoupling of the plasma and magnetic field in spicules. Our results indicate that ambipolar diffusion is a critical ingredient for understanding the magnetothermodynamic properties in the chromosphere and transition region. The numerical simulations have been made publicly available, similar to previous Bifrost simulations. This will allow the community to study realistic numerical simulations with a wider range of magnetic field configurations and physics modules than previously possible.",

In response to workforce limitations and the growing complexity of healthcare, scientists have tested new models of care that redesign clinical practice. This article describes why new models of care in aging, dementia, and mental health diffuse inadequately into the healthcare systems and communities where they might benefit older adults. We review a general framework for the diffusion of innovations and highlight the importance of other features of innovations that deter or facilitate diffusion. Although scientists often focus on generating evidence‐based innovations, end‐users apply their own criteria to determine an innovation's value. In 1962, Rogers suggested six features of an innovation that facilitate or deter diffusion suggested: relative advantage, compatibility with the existing environment, ease or difficulty of implementation, trial‐ability or ability to “test drive”, adaptability, and observed effectiveness. We describe examples of models of care in aging, dementia and mental health that enjoy a modicum of diffusion into practice and place the features of these models in the context of deterrents and facilitators for diffusion. Developers of models of care in aging, dementia, and mental health typically fail to incorporate the complexities of health systems, the barriers to diffusion, and the role of emotion into design considerations of new models. We describe agile implementation as a strategy to facilitate the speed and scale of diffusion in the setting of complex adaptive systems, social networks, and dynamic macroenvironments.",

Among the alkali metal ions, cesium and potassium increase and sodium strongly decreases the diffusion constant of water. The origin of the difference can be understood by examining the simulation results using different potential models. In this work, aqueous solutions of salts are simulated with a variety of models. Commonly used non-polarizable models, which otherwise reproduce many experimental properties, do not capture the trend in the diffusion constant, while models which include polarization and/or charge transfer interactions do. For the non-polarizable models, the diffusion constant decreases too strongly with salt concentration. The changes in the water diffusion constant with increasing salt concentration match the diffusion constant of the ion. The ion diffusion constant is dependent on the residence time for water in the ion solvation shell. The non-polarizable models over-estimate the residence time, relative to the translational diffusion constant and so tend to under-estimate the ion and water diffusion constants.",

We studied the characteristics of the aging process in copper (Cu) added to soils and the factors that affect this process. Then we developed a semi-mechanistic model to predict the lability of Cu during the aging process with descriptions of the diffusion process using complementary error function. In the previous studies, two semi-mechanistic models to separately predict short-term and long-term aging of Cu added to soils were developed with individual descriptions of the diffusion process. In the short-term model, the diffusion process was linearly related to the square root of incubation time (t1/2), and in the long-term model, the diffusion process was linearly related to the natural logarithm of incubation time (lnt). Both models could predict short-term or long-term aging processes separately, but could not predict the short- and long-term aging processes by one model. By analyzing and combining the two models, we found that the short- and long-term behaviors of the diffusion process could be described adequately using the complementary error function. The effect of temperature on the diffusion process was obtained in this model as well. The model can predict the aging process continuously based on four factors—soil pH, incubation time, soil organic matter content and temperature.",

Here, we present a novel age-structured, continuous macroscopic model for the movement of myxobacteria. The derivation is based on microscopic interaction rules that can be formulated as a particle-based model and set within the Self-Organized Hydrodynamics (SOH) framework. The strength of this combined approach is that microscopic knowledge or data can be incorporated easily into the particle model, whilst the continuous model allows for easy numerical analysis of the different effects. However, we found that the derived macroscopic model lacks a diffusion term in the density equations, which is necessary to control the number of waves, indicating that a higher order approximation during the derivation is crucial. Upon ad hoc addition of the diffusion term, we found very good agreement between the age-structured model and the biology. In particular, we analyzed the influence of a refractory (insensitivity) period following a reversal of movement. Our analysis reveals that the refractory period is not necessary for wave formation, but essential to wave synchronization, indicating separate molecular mechanisms.",

To seamlessly fuse the edited region with the unchanged parts of the image, we spatially blend noised versions of the input image with the local text-guided diffusion latent at a progression of noise levels. In addition, we show that adding augmentations to the diffusion process mitigates adversarial results. We compare against several baselines and related methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and show that our method outperforms these solutions in terms of overall realism, ability to preserve the background and matching the text.

When the forward noising process is given by a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), Song et al. (2021) demonstrate how the time inhomogeneous drift of the associated reverse-time SDE may be estimated using score-matching. A limitation of this approach is that the forward-time SDE must be run for a sufficiently long time for the final distribution to be approximately Gaussian. In contrast, solving the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge problem (SB), i.e. an entropy-regularized optimal transport problem on path spaces, yields diffusions which generate samples from the data distribution in finite time. We present Diffusion SB (DSB), an original approximation of the Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) procedure to solve the SB problem, and provide theoretical analysis along with generative modeling experiments. The first DSB iteration recovers the methodology proposed by Song et al. (2021), with the flexibility of using shorter time intervals, as subsequent DSB iterations reduce the discrepancy between the final-time marginal of the forward (resp. backward) SDE with respect to the prior (resp. data) distribution. Beyond generative modeling, DSB offers a widely applicable computational optimal transport tool as the continuous state-space analogue of the popular Sinkhorn algorithm (Cuturi, 2013).",

This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid, diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a specific property.

Stars with become white dwarfs and cool to the point where the electrons are degenerate and the ions are strongly coupled, a realm now available to study with MESA due to improved treatments of element diffusion, latent heat release, and blending of equations of state. Studies of the final fates of massive stars are extended in MESA by our addition of an approximate Riemann solver that captures shocks and conserves energy to high accuracy during dynamic epochs. We also introduce a 1D capability for modeling the effects of Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities that, in combination with the coupling to a public version of the radiation transfer instrument, creates new avenues for exploring Type II supernova properties. These capabilities are exhibited with exploratory models of pair-instability supernovae, pulsational pair-instability supernovae, and the formation of stellar-mass black holes. The applicability of MESA is now widened by the capability to import multidimensional hydrodynamic models into MESA.

        "title": "A Conditional Point Diffusion-Refinement Paradigm for 3D Point Cloud Completion",
        "abstract": "3D point cloud is an important 3D representation for capturing real world 3D objects. However, real-scanned 3D point clouds are often incomplete, and it is important to recover complete point clouds for downstream applications. Most existing point cloud completion methods use Chamfer Distance (CD) loss for training. The CD loss estimates correspondences between two point clouds by searching nearest neighbors, which does not capture the overall point density distribution on the generated shape, and therefore likely leads to non-uniform point cloud generation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Point Diffusion-Refinement (PDR) paradigm for point cloud completion. PDR consists of a Conditional Generation Network (CGNet) and a ReFinement Network (RFNet). The CGNet uses a conditional generative model called the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to generate a coarse completion conditioned on the partial observation. DDPM establishes a one-to-one pointwise mapping between the generated point cloud and the uniform ground truth, and then optimizes the mean squared error loss to realize uniform generation. The RFNet refines the coarse output of the CGNet and further improves quality of the completed point cloud. Furthermore, we develop a novel dual-path architecture for both networks. The architecture can (1) effectively and efficiently extract multi-level features from partially observed point clouds to guide completion, and (2) accurately manipulate spatial locations of 3D points to obtain smooth surfaces and sharp details. Extensive experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that our PDR paradigm outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for point cloud completion. Remarkably, with the help of the RFNet, we can accelerate the iterative generation process of the DDPM by up to 50 times without much performance drop.",

        "abstract": "Significance Twitter and other social media platforms are believed to have altered the course of numerous historical events, from the Arab Spring to the US presidential election. Online social networks have become a ubiquitous medium for discussing moral and political ideas. Nevertheless, the field of moral psychology has yet to investigate why some moral and political ideas spread more widely than others. Using a large sample of social media communications concerning polarizing issues in public policy debates (gun control, same-sex marriage, climate change), we found that the presence of moral-emotional language in political messages substantially increases their diffusion within (and less so between) ideological group boundaries. These findings offer insights into how moral ideas spread within networks during real political discussion. Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call “moral contagion.” Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20% for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.",

An increased understanding of user adoption is necessary to promote AV usage. This study applied an integrated model based on innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine the factors influencing a user’s behavioural intention to use AVs. Then, a questionnaire was designed, and structural equation analysis was conducted on the 274 collected survey results. Results confirmed previous research findings that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU) positively influence users’ behavioural intention to use AVs. Moreover, the results revealed new findings that both PU and PEOU were influenced by the perceived characteristics of innovation (PCIs, i.e. relative advantage, compatibility, image, result demonstrability, visibility, and trialability). These findings contribute to theory building concerning human–computer interactions and guide policy and strategy formulation for promoting AVs.",

        "title": "Comparing information diffusion mechanisms by matching on cascade size",
        "abstract": "Significance Do different types of information spread differently online? In recent years, studies have sought answers to such questions by comparing statistical properties of network paths taken by different kinds of content diffusing online. Here, we demonstrate the importance of controlling for correlations between properties being compared. In particular, we show that previously reported structural differences between diffusion paths of false and true news on Twitter disappear when comparing only cascades of the same size; differences between diffusion paths of images, videos, news, and petitions persist. Paired with a theoretical analysis of diffusion processes, our results suggest that, in order to limit the spread of false news, it may be enough to focus on reducing the mean “infectiousness” of the information. Do some types of information spread faster, broader, or further than others? To understand how information diffusions differ, scholars compare structural properties of the paths taken by content as it spreads through a network, studying so-called cascades. Commonly studied cascade properties include the reach, depth, breadth, and speed of propagation. Drawing conclusions from statistical differences in these properties can be challenging, as many properties are dependent. In this work, we demonstrate the essentiality of controlling for cascade sizes when studying structural differences between collections of cascades. We first revisit two datasets from notable recent studies of online diffusion that reported content-specific differences in cascade topology: an exhaustive corpus of Twitter cascades for verified true- or false-news content by Vosoughi et al. [S. Vosoughi, D. Roy, S. Aral. Science 359, 1146–1151 (2018)] and a comparison of Twitter cascades of videos, pictures, news, and petitions by Goel et al. [S. Goel, A. Anderson, J. Hofman, D. J. Watts. Manage. Sci. 62, 180–196 (2016)]. Using methods that control for joint cascade statistics, we find that for false- and true-news cascades, the reported structural differences can almost entirely be explained by false-news cascades being larger. For videos, images, news, and petitions, structural differences persist when controlling for size. Studying classical models of diffusion, we then give conditions under which differences in structural properties under different models do or do not reduce to differences in size. Our findings are consistent with the mechanisms underlying true- and false-news diffusion being quite similar, differing primarily in the basic infectiousness of their spreading process.",

        "abstract": "Understanding the salt-water separation mechanisms of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes is critical for the further development and optimization of RO technology. The solution-diffusion (SD) model is widely used to describe water and salt transport in RO, but it does not describe the intricate transport mechanisms of water molecules and ions through the membrane. In this study, we develop an ion transport model for RO, referred to as the solution-friction model, by rigorously considering the mechanisms of partitioning and the interactions among water, salt ions, and the membrane. Ion transport through the membrane is described by the extended Nernst-Planck equation, with the consideration of frictions between the species (i.e., ion, water, and membrane matrix). Water flow through the membrane is governed by the hydraulic pressure gradient and the friction between the water and membrane matrix as well as the friction between water and ions. The model is validated using experimental measurements of salt rejection and permeate water flux in a lab-scale, cross-flow RO setup. We then investigate the effects of feed salt concentration and hydraulic pressure on salt permeability, demonstrating strong dependence of salt permeability on feed salt concentration and applied pressure, starkly disparate from the SD model. Lastly, we develop a framework to analyze the pressure drop distribution across the membrane, demonstrating that cross-membrane transport dominates the overall pressure drop in RO, in marked contrast to the SD model that assumes no pressure drop across the membrane.",

This study analyses the diffusion of financial technology (fintech) and its interaction with financial inclusion and living standards (GDP per capita). We consider the determinants and effects of technology diffusion in financial services and identify two possible transmission mechanisms from the financial sector to GDP per capita – a fintech diffusion channel and a financial inclusion channel. We specify the interactions between these two channels and their relationship with income per capita. Our empirical analysis focuses on the diffusion of two enabling fintech innovations: ATMs and associated digital networks; and mobile phones and payments systems. The relationships between fintech diffusion, financial inclusion and GDP per capita are estimated using a panel data set for up to 137 countries over the period 1991–2015 using both cross section and panel techniques, including an error correction model that distinguishes short- and long-run effects. A key finding is that fintech diffusion and financial inclusion have long-run effects on GDP per capita over and above their short-run impact and the effects of investment in fixed and human capital.",

This paper proposes an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) that has been tested and examined through the use of both innovation diffusion theory (IDT) and integrating TAM.

The findings illustrate that six perceptions of innovation characteristics, in particular, have impacts on students’ e-learning system behavioral intention. The influences of the relative advantages, observability, trialability, perceived compatibility, complexity, and perceived enjoyment on the perceived ease of use is noteworthy. Moreover, the effects of the relative advantages, complexity, trialability, observability, perceived compatibility, and perceived enjoyment on the perceived usefulness have a strong impact. Therefore, the empirical results provide strong backing to the integrative approach between TAM and IDT. The findings suggest an extended model of TAM with IDT for the acceptance of the e-learning system used to improve the students’ learning performance, which can help decision makers in higher education, universities, as well as colleges to evaluate, plan and execute the use of e-learning systems.",

No-tably, message passing based GNNs, e.g., graph convolutional networks, leverage the immediate neighbors of each node during the aggregation process, and recently, graph diffusion convolution (GDC) is proposed to expand the propagation neighborhood by leveraging generalized graph diffusion. However, the neighborhood size in GDC is manually tuned for each graph by conducting grid search over the validation set, making its generalization practically limited. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive diffusion convolution (ADC) * strategy to automatically learn the optimal neighborhood size from the data. Furthermore, we break the conventional assumption that all GNN layers and feature channels (dimensions) should use the same neighborhood size for propagation. We design strategies to enable ADC to learn a dedicated propagation neighborhood for each GNN layer and each feature channel, making the GNN architecture fully coupled with graph structures—the unique property that differs GNNs from traditional neural networks. By directly plugging ADC into existing GNNs, we observe consistent and signiﬁcant outperformance over both GDC and their vanilla versions across various datasets, demonstrating the improved model capacity brought by automatically learning unique neighborhood size per layer and per channel in GNNs.",

        "abstract": "Understanding typical, healthy brain development provides a baseline from which to detect and characterize brain anomalies associated with various neurological or psychiatric disorders and diseases. Diffusion MRI is well suited to study white matter development, as it can virtually extract individual tracts and yield parameters that may reflect alterations in the underlying neural micro‐structure (e.g. myelination, axon density, fiber coherence), though it is limited by its lack of specificity and other methodological concerns. This review summarizes the last decade of diffusion imaging studies of healthy white matter development spanning childhood to early adulthood (4–35 years). Conclusions about anatomical location, rates, and timing of white matter development with age are discussed, as well as the influence of image acquisition, analysis, age range/sample size, and statistical model. Despite methodological variability between studies, some consistent findings have emerged from the literature. Specifically, diffusion studies of neurodevelopment overwhelmingly demonstrate regionally varying increases of fractional anisotropy and decreases of mean diffusivity during childhood and adolescence, some of which continue into adulthood. While most studies use linear fits to model age‐related changes, studies with sufficient sample sizes and age range provide clear evidence that white matter development (as indicated by diffusion) is non‐linear. Several studies further suggest that maturation in association tracts with frontal‐temporal connections continues later than commissural and projection tracts. The emerging contributions of more advanced diffusion methods are also discussed, as they may reveal new aspects of white matter development. Although non‐specific, diffusion changes may reflect increases of myelination, axonal packing, and/or coherence with age that may be associated with changes in cognition.",

In this study, we focus on a periodic-aware intelligent prediction method based on a comprehensive modeling of user and contagion features, which can be applied to support information diffusion across social networks in accordance with users’ adoption behaviors. In particular, the Dynamically Socialized User Networking (DSUN) model and sentiment-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model, which consider a series of social factors, including user interests and social roles, semantic topics and sentiment polarities, are constructed and integrated together to facilitate the information diffusion process. A periodic-aware preception mechanism usingreinforcement learning with a newly designed reward rule based on topic distribution is then designed to detect and classify different periods into the so-called routine period and emergency period. Finally, a deep learning scheme based on multi-factor analysis is developed for adoption behavior prediction within the identified different periods. Experiments using the real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of our proposed model and method in heterogenous social network environments.",

        "abstract": "An important underlying assumption that guides the success of the existing multiview learning algorithms is the full observation of the multiview data. However, such rigorous precondition clearly violates the common-sense knowledge in practical applications, where in most cases, only incomplete fractions of the multiview data are given. The presence of the incomplete settings generally disables the conventional multiview clustering methods. In this article, we propose a simple but effective incomplete multiview clustering (IMC) framework, which simultaneously considers the local geometric information and the unbalanced discriminating powers of these incomplete multiview observations. Specifically, a novel graph-regularized matrix factorization model, on the one hand, is developed to preserve the local geometric similarities of the learned common representations from different views. On the other hand, the semantic consistency constraint is introduced to stimulate these view-specific representations toward a unified discriminative representation. Moreover, the importance of different views is adaptively determined to reduce the negative influence of the unbalanced incomplete views. Furthermore, an efficient learning algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting optimization problem. Extensive experimental results performed on several incomplete multiview datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve superior clustering performance in comparison with some state-of-the-art multiview learning methods.",

        "abstract": "Quantitative diffusion imaging techniques enable the characterization of tissue microstructural properties of the human brain \"in vivo\", and are widely used in neuroscientific and clinical contexts. In this review, we present the basic physical principles behind diffusion imaging and provide an overview of the current diffusion techniques, including standard and advanced techniques as well as their main clinical applications. Standard diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers sensitivity to changes in microstructure due to diseases and enables the characterization of single fiber distributions within a voxel as well as diffusion anisotropy. Nonetheless, its inability to represent complex intravoxel fiber topologies and the limited biological specificity of its metrics motivated the development of several advanced diffusion MRI techniques. For example, high-angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) techniques enabled the characterization of fiber crossing areas and other complex fiber topologies in a single voxel and supported the development of higher-order signal representations aiming to decompose the diffusion MRI signal into distinct microstructure compartments. Biophysical models, often known by their acronym (e.g., CHARMED, WMTI, NODDI, DBSI, DIAMOND) contributed to capture the diffusion properties from each of such tissue compartments, enabling the computation of voxel-wise maps of axonal density and/or morphology that hold promise as clinically viable biomarkers in several neurological and neuroscientific applications; for example, to quantify tissue alterations due to disease or healthy processes. Current challenges and limitations of state-of-the-art models are discussed, including validation efforts. Finally, novel diffusion encoding approaches (e.g., b-tensor or double diffusion encoding) may increase the biological specificity of diffusion metrics towards intra-voxel diffusion heterogeneity in clinical settings, holding promise in neurological applications.",

To cope with such a fast-changing environment, organisations have been steadily implementing different types of technologies, and at different stages. One of the most disruptive and promising technology is blockchain, and its potential to transform various aspects of organisations’ business and operations, including the supply chain relationships, is tremendous. In line with the global research trend in this domain, this paper proposes a multi-stage model of adoption (intention, adoption, and routinisation stages), for a better understanding of blockchain diffusion across supply chains. We drew on the diffusion of innovations theory, the resource-based view, dynamic capability, the technology adoption model, and the institutional theory to propose a multi-stage model. We validated the model using PLS-SEM, which was applied on data collected in India and the U.S. Our results showed that, from one country to another, there are essential differences in the variables that determine blockchain innovation and in the stage of diffusion. Additionally, our proposed model provided a good explanation at all stages of blockchain diffusion. This study offers significant and valuable contributions in terms of theory and management.",

However, the existing analysis methods for GITT data require numerous assumptions, and the derived diffusion coefficients typically are not independently validated. To investigate the validity of the assumptions and derived diffusion coefficients, we employ a direct pulse fitting method for interpreting GITT data that involves numerically fitting an electrochemical pulse and subsequent relaxation to a one-dimensional, single-particle, electrochemical model coupled with non-ideal transport to directly evaluate diffusion coefficients that are independently verified through cycling predictions. Extracted from GITT measurements of the intercalation regime of FeS2 and used to predict the discharge behavior, our non-ideal diffusion coefficients prove to be two orders of magnitude more accurate than ideal diffusion coefficients extracted using conventional methods. We further extend our model to a polydisperse set of particles to show the validity of a single-particle approach when the modeled radius is proportional to the total volume-to-surface-area ratio of the system.",

        "abstract": "The morphological instability of the lithium metal anode is the key factor restricting the rate capability of lithium metal solid state batteries. During lithium stripping, pore formation takes place at the interface due to the slow diffusion kinetics of vacancies in the lithium metal. The resulting current focusing increases the internal cell resistance and promotes fast lithium penetration. In this work, galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to investigate operando the morphological changes at the interface by analysis of the interface capacitances. Therewith, the effect of temperature, stack pressure, and chemical modification is investigated. The work demonstrates that introducing 10 at% Mg into the lithium metal anode can effectively prevent contact loss. Nevertheless, a fundamental kinetic limitation is also observed for the Li‐rich alloy, namely the diffusion controlled decrease of the lithium metal concentration at the interface. An analytical diffusion model is used to describe the temperature‐dependent delithiation kinetics of Li–Mg alloys. Overall, it is shown that different electrode design concepts should be considered. Mg alloying can increase lithium utilization, when no external pressure is applied while pure lithium metal is superior for setups that allow stack pressures in the MPa range.",

Diffusion with stochastic resetting serves as a paradigmatic model to study these phenomena, but the lack of a well-controlled platform by which this process can be studied experimentally has been a major impediment to research in the field. Here, we report the experimental realization of colloidal particle diffusion and resetting via holographic optical tweezers. We provide the first experimental corroboration of central theoretical results and go on to measure the energetic cost of resetting in steady-state and first-passage scenarios. In both cases, we show that this cost cannot be made arbitrarily small because of fundamental constraints on realistic resetting protocols. The methods developed herein open the door to future experimental study of resetting phenomena beyond diffusion.",

        "abstract": "This paper describes a novel diffusion model, DyDiff-VAE, for information diffusion prediction on social media. Given the initial content and a sequence of forwarding users, DyDiff-VAE aims to estimate the propagation likelihood for other potential users and predict the corresponding user rankings. Inferring user interests from diffusion data lies the foundation of diffusion prediction, because users often forward the information in which they are interested or the information from those who share similar interests. Their interests also evolve over time as the result of the dynamic social influence from neighbors and the time-sensitive information gained inside/outside the social media. Existing works fail to model users' intrinsic interests from the diffusion data and assume user interests remain static along the time. DyDiff-VAE advances the state of the art in two directions: (i) We propose a dynamic encoder to infer the evolution of user interests from observed diffusion data. (ii) We propose a dual attentive decoder to estimate the propagation likelihood by integrating information from both the initial cascade content and the forwarding user sequence. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets from Twitter and Youtube demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model; we show that it achieves 43.3%relative gains over the best baseline on average. Moreover, it has the lowest run-time compared with recurrent neural network based models.",

        "abstract": "Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction is extremely significant to ensure the safe and reliable operation for bearing suffering from the deterioration. The main focus of the RUL prediction is to accurately predict the future failure event, and thus, how to quantify the prediction uncertainty will be a major concern. However, current deep learning based RUL prediction methods are difficult to reflect the uncertainty of the RUL prediction results. Toward this end, we propose a RUL prediction model based on the deep belief network (DBN) and diffusion process (DP) in this article. The proposed method consists of two parts: feature extraction combining DBN and locally linear embedding (LLE), DP-based RUL prediction. In the first part, DBN is used to extract deep hidden features behind the monitoring signals, and then the features with higher tendency are screened as the input of LLE. The health index that can truly reflect the bearing health condition is further determined through LLE. In the second part, a health index evolving model based on DP is presented and the probability density function (PDF) of the predicted RUL is accordingly derived in the sense of the first hitting time (FHT). As such, the proposed method holds promise to improve the prediction accuracy and facilitate the prognostic uncertainty. Finally, experimental studies on the bearing degradation data and the associated comparative analysis verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.",

In their 2011 article, Dimaggio and Garip use an agent-based model of diffusion on a real-life population for empirical illustration and, thus, do not consider consolidation (correlation between traits), a population parameter that shapes network structure and diffusion. Using an agent-based model, this article shows that prior findings linking homophily to segregated social ties and to differential diffusion outcomes are contingent on high levels of consolidation. Homophily, under low consolidation, is not sufficient to exacerbate existing differences in adoption probabilities across groups and can even end up alleviating intergroup inequality by facilitating diffusion.",

This is known to be a challenging problem that has received much attention in the last two decades. This article contributes to this rich body of literature by presenting a new avenue to obtain diffusion bridge approximations. Our approach is based on a backward time representation of a diffusion bridge, which may be simulated if one can time-reverse the unconditioned diffusion. We introduce a variational formulation to learn this time-reversal with function approximation and rely on a score matching method to circumvent intractability. Another iteration of our proposed methodology approximates the Doob’s h -transform deﬁning the forward time representation of a diffusion bridge. We dis-cuss algorithmic considerations and extensions, and present numerical results on an Ornstein– Uhlenbeck process, a model from ﬁnancial econometrics for interest rates, and a model from genetics for cell differentiation and development to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "abstract": "\n Lithium-ion battery (LIB), as energy storage devices, is widely used in portable electronic devices and have promising applications in electric vehicles. The volume change and large stress can lead to electrode pulverization and the resultant loss of electrical contact from the current collector, which is considered to be one of the main reasons for the capacity degradation of LIB. To reduce diffusion-induced stress of the electrode system during lithium-ion diffusion, a chemo-mechanical coupled theoretical model of bilayer electrode system of electrode layer bonded to the current collector is established. The theoretical results show that diffusion-induced stresses at the electrode–collector interface and maximum tensile stress at the top surface of the electrode layer are alleviated greatly by introducing pre-strain. The effects of pre-strain and lithium-ion concentration on chemo-mechanical coupled behavior of the bilayer electrode system are discussed. In particular, the lithium-ion concentration difference strongly depends on the diffusion thickness and time. The curvature when considering plastic deformation is smaller than that when not considering the plastic deformation. In addition, the effects of plastic deformation of the current collector and diffusion time on biaxial stress distribution are also discussed. The biaxial stress decreases with the increase of pre-strain and decrease of dimensionless time during galvanostatic charging. The biaxial stress when considering plastic deformation is smaller than that when not considering the plastic deformation. The results obtained from this investigation will provide a reference to reduce the diffusion-induced stress and improve the ion diffusion performance of LIB.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by the observation that pattern structures high-frequently recur within intra-task also across tasks, we propose a pattern-structure diffusion (PSD) framework to mine and propagate task-specific and task-across pattern structures in the task-level space for joint depth estimation, segmentation and surface normal prediction. To represent local pattern structures, we model them as small-scale graphlets, and propagate them in two different ways, i.e., intra-task and inter-task PSD. For the former, to overcome the limit of the locality of pattern structures, we use the high-order recursive aggregation on neighbors to multiplicatively increase the spread scope, so that long-distance patterns are propagated in the intra-task space. In the inter-task PSD, we mutually transfer the counterpart structures corresponding to the same spatial position into the task itself based on the matching degree of paired pattern structures therein. Finally, the intra-task and inter-task pattern structures are jointly diffused among the task-level patterns, and encapsulated into an end-to-end PSD network to boost the performance of multi-task learning. Extensive experiments on two widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed PSD is more effective and also achieves the state-of-the-art or competitive results.",

Fluctuations from multiple sources create significant additive noise in DWI data which must be suppressed before subsequent microstructure analysis. We introduce a self-supervised learning method for denoising DWI data, Patch2Self, which uses the entire volume to learn a full-rank locally linear denoiser for that volume. By taking advantage of the oversampled q-space of DWI data, Patch2Self can separate structure from noise without requiring an explicit model for either. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Patch2Self via quantitative and qualitative improvements in microstructure modeling, tracking (via fiber bundle coherency) and model estimation relative to other unsupervised methods on real and simulated data.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion-mediated surface phenomena are crucial for human life and industry, with examples ranging from oxygen capture by lung alveolar surface to heterogeneous catalysis, gene regulation, membrane permeation, and filtration processes. Their current description via diffusion equations with mixed boundary conditions is limited to simple surface reactions with infinite or constant reactivity. In this Letter, we propose a probabilistic approach based on the concept of boundary local time to investigate the intricate dynamics of diffusing particles near a reactive surface. Reformulating surface-particle interactions in terms of stopping conditions, we obtain in a unified way major diffusion-reaction characteristics such as the propagator, the survival probability, the first-passage time distribution, and the reaction rate. This general formalism allows us to describe new surface reaction mechanisms such as for instance surface reactivity depending on the number of encounters with the diffusing particle that can model the effects of catalyst fooling or membrane degradation. The disentanglement of the geometric structure of the medium from surface reactivity opens far-reaching perspectives for modeling, optimization, and control of diffusion-mediated surface phenomena.",

        "abstract": "Social Internet of Things (SIoT), integrating the social networks and Internet of Things (IoT), leads to heterogeneous interactions of thing to thing, human to human, and human to thing, which in turn generates exploded information. Hence, as the soul of SIoT, information with its interaction and diffusion, records the track of humans and things and contains the hidden value for social administration and people’s lives. Therefore, how to characterize the interplay between behavior spreading and information diffusion in SIoT is essential to predict and manage the information. Motivated by this, a more comprehensive understanding of the coupled modeling of social interaction and information diffusion processes in SIoT is conceived first. With the widespread adoption of cloud-edge computing, different nodes have different consciousness on information. Hence, a cloud-edge-aided information diffusion model is proposed for efficient interactions, which incorporates the role of edge in timely processing and feedback. On this basis, a blockchain-based cloud-edge SIoT architecture is proposed for traceability and security of information diffusion. Furthermore, the dynamical analysis of the coupled model in SIoT is provided, which illustrates the outbreak threshold, stability, and scale of information propagation. An interesting finding is that interactive behavior spreading only influences the final size of information propagation, not the spreading threshold. Extensive simulation results and detailed performance analysis verify the theoretical results, which are beneficial to provide traceable dissemination so as to find the most influential node and control the scale of information diffusion.",

        "abstract": "This survey paper focuses on modulation aspects of molecular communication, an emerging field focused on building biologically-inspired systems that embed data within chemical signals. The primary challenges in designing these systems are how to encode and modulate information onto chemical signals, and how to design a receiver that can detect and decode the information from the corrupted chemical signal observed at the destination. In this article, we focus on modulation design for molecular communication via diffusion systems. In these systems, chemical signals are transported using diffusion, possibly assisted by flow, from the transmitter to the receiver. This tutorial presents recent advancements in modulation and demodulation schemes for molecular communication via diffusion. We compare five different modulation types: concentration-based, type-based, timing-based, spatial, and higher-order modulation techniques. The end-to-end system designs for each modulation scheme are presented. In addition, the key metrics used in the literature to evaluate the performance of these techniques are also presented. Finally, we provide a numerical bit error rate comparison of prominent modulation techniques using analytical models. We close the tutorial with a discussion of key open issues and future research directions for design of molecular communication via diffusion systems.",

        "title": "A new preferential diffusion model applied to FGM simulations of hydrogen flames",
        "abstract": "Preferential diffusion is very important in simulations of hydrogen flames. Flame stretch and curvature induce strong preferential diffusion effects in laminar premixed hydrogen flames, causing strong local deviations from the unburnt mixture fraction in the reaction zone. In tabulated chemistry methods, this necessitates the use of a partially premixed model even if the inlet mixture is purely premixed. Furthermore, in realistic combustion problems heat losses often play a dominant role. In this paper we derive a preferential diffusion model for constant but non-unity species Lewis numbers using three controlling variables, namely mixture fraction, progress variable and enthalpy. The model has been implemented in the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) approach and validated by comparing with detailed chemistry simulations. As a test case we investigate a 2D laminar premixed hydrogen flame stabilised on an isothermal slit burner. Additionally, the model was compared with the standard treatment of preferential diffusion in FGM to show the increase in accuracy of the new model presented in this paper. The new model shows a significant improvement compared to the previous model, which can be attributed to the inclusion of cross-diffusion. The importance of the additional diffusion terms and its variation in mixture fraction for initially purely premixed hydrogen flames is highlighted.",

The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of public policies in the diffusion of EVs in Brazil, based on Beck’s adaptation for the Bass diffusion model. This modification on the Bass model allows the estimation of EV diffusion, taking into account the direct and indirect economic influence of the main EV incentive instruments used worldwide. In addition, this work conducts a forecast of the total passenger cars in Brazil through a regression model, considering macroeconomic and social indicators. The results indicate that EV high prices may still be the major barrier for EV diffusion in Brazil over the studied horizon, keeping them inaccessible to the majority of the population. Therefore, policies aimed at subsidizing EVs may be more effective in stimulating EV sales.",

Integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM) with the innovation diffusion theory (IDT), the present research proposes an extended technology acceptance model. Testing of data collected from 1148 students using (MOOCs) system in Malaysia achieved the research objective. The findings obtained via a quantitative research method, based on analysing the results using a Structure Equation Modeling (SEM). The outcomes reveal that six views of novelty features swayed students’ a (MOOCs) scheme behavioural objective. The properties of the relative advantages, intricacy, trialability, observability, compatibility, and perceived enjoyment on the perceived ease of use are significant. Also, the effects of the relative advantages, complexity, trialability, observability, compatibility, and perceived enjoyment on the usefulness have a substantial impact. Therefore, the practical outcomes offer robust backing for the integrative method between TAM and IDT. The results recommend a prolonged model of TAM with IDT for the taking of MOOCs) system used to improve students learning performance, which can help decision makers in higher education, universities and colleges to planning, evaluating and executing the use of (MOOCs) systems.",

        "abstract": "We study the effect of resetting on diffusion in a logarithmic potential. In this model, a particle diffusing in a potential U(x) = U0 log |x| is reset, i.e., taken back to its initial position, with a constant rate r. We show that this analytically tractable model system exhibits a series of transitions as a function of a single parameter, βU0, the ratio of the strength of the potential to the thermal energy. For βU0 < -1, the potential is strongly repulsive, preventing the particle from reaching the origin. Resetting then generates a non-equilibrium steady state, which is exactly characterized and thoroughly analyzed. In contrast, for βU0 > -1, the potential is either weakly repulsive or attractive, and the diffusing particle eventually reaches the origin. In this case, we provide a closed-form expression for the subsequent first-passage time distribution and show that a resetting transition occurs at βU0 = 5. Namely, we find that resetting can expedite arrival to the origin when -1 < βU0 < 5, but not when βU0 > 5. The results presented herein generalize the results for simple diffusion with resetting-a widely applicable model that is obtained from ours by setting U0 = 0. Extending to general potential strengths, our work opens the door to theoretical and experimental investigation of a plethora of problems that bring together resetting and diffusion in logarithmic potential.",

        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed tremendous interest in understanding and predicting information spread on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. Existing diffusion prediction methods primarily exploit the sequential order of influenced users by projecting diffusion cascades onto their local social neighborhoods. However, this fails to capture global social structures that do not explicitly manifest in any of the cascades, resulting in poor performance for inactive users with limited historical activities. In this paper, we present a novel variational autoencoder framework (Inf-VAE) to jointly embed homophily and influence through proximity-preserving social and position-encoded temporal latent variables. To model social homophily, Inf-VAE utilizes powerful graph neural network architectures to learn social variables that selectively exploit the social connections of users. Given a sequence of seed user activations, Inf-VAE uses a novel expressive co-attentive fusion network that jointly attends over their social and temporal variables to predict the set of all influenced users. Our experimental results on multiple real-world social network datasets, including Digg, Weibo, and Stack-Exchanges demonstrate significant gains (22% MAP@10) for Inf-VAE over state-of-the-art diffusion prediction models; we achieve massive gains for users with sparse activities, and users who lack direct social neighbors in seed sets.",

        "abstract": "PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore the antecedents of the behavioral intention and adoption of mobile payment services like m-wallets and m-banking by users in India. This is done by examining the diffusion of mobile payment technology within an extended framework of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The study attempts to extend the UTAUT model further by introducing three more constructs, namely- perceived cost, perceived risk and demonetization effect and analyzes the impact of demonetization that happened in India from November 8, 2016 to December 30, 2016 on the mobile payment service adoption process. Demonetization event is a case in point to assess whether forced adoption breaks the normal diffusion process or lends support to the same in the long term.Design/methodology/approachA survey was conducted in order to gauge the intention behind the adoption of mobile payment modes by users in India. The questionnaire was administered online solely and 880 responses were received within a period of 20 days from February 3, 2017, to February 23, 2017, using Google Forms as a medium. Usable responses were 640. The study adopted partial least square based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique to analyze the relation between latent variables: performance expectation, effort expectation, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived cost, perceived risk, demonetization effect, behavioral intention and usage. For this purpose, SmartPLS3.0 software was used to create path diagrams and calculate estimate the significance of factor loadings using the bootstrap technique.FindingsThe key results indicates that behavioral intention, demonetization and facilitating conditions have a positive and significant impact on the adoption of mobile payment services in India. Overall, Model 3, which was extended UTAUT model, was observed to be a better model in explaining the antecedents of behavioral intention and usage. In addition to UTAUT antecedents, perceived cost and perceived risk proved to have additional explanatory power as antecedents of behavioral intention. Age acts as a moderating variable consistently across three models, implying that younger users give more importance to effortless interface of mobile payment services and get more influenced by peers and society that shapes their intention to use mobile payment services.Originality/valueIt is first of its kind attempt to assess the role of Demonetization in examining the antecedents of behavioral intention and adoption of mobile payment services by users in India under an extended UTAUT model. This study comprehensively examined the impact of forced adoption of mobile payment services by users in India in a natural setting provided by demonetization event that took place in India by conducting a primary survey right itself in the month of February, 2017 to get first hand response from the Indian users.",

        "abstract": "Nanofluids are potential heat transfer fluids with improved thermophysical properties and heat transfer performance. Double diffusion convection plays an important role in natural processes and technical applications. The effect of double convection by diffusion is not limited to oceanography, but is also evident in geology, astrophysics, and metallurgy. For such a vital role of such factors in applications, the authors have presented the analytical solutions of pumping flow of third-grade nanofluid and described the effects of double diffusion convection through a compliant curved channel. The model used for the third-grade nanofluid includes the presence of Brownian motion and thermophoresis. Additionally, thermal energy expressions suggest regular diffusion and cross-diffusion terms. The governing equations have been constructed for incompressible laminar flow of the non-Newtonian nanofluid along with the assumption of long wavelength. The obtained analytical expressions for velocity, temperature, and nanoparticle concentration have been sketched for various considerable parameters. The effects of regular buoyancy ratio, buoyancy parameter, modified Dufour parameter, and Dufour-solutal Lewis number have been analyzed along with wall properties and pumping characteristics. This study concludes that fluid becomes hotter with increase in regular buoyancy ratio and a modified Dufour parameter, but a decrease in temperature is observed for the buoyancy parameter. Moreover, the solutal concentration is behaving inversely against the Defour-Solutal Lewis number.",

        "title": "A Multiscale Model for Solute Diffusion in Hydrogels",
        "abstract": "The number of biomedical applications of hydrogels is increasing rapidly on account of their unique physical, structural, and mechanical properties. The utility of hydrogels as drug delivery systems or tissue engineering scaffolds critically depends on the control of diffusion of solutes through the hydrogel matrix. Predicting or even modeling this diffusion is challenging due to the complex structure of hydrogels. Currently, the diffusivity of solutes in hydrogels is typically modeled by one of three main theories proceeding from distinct diffusion mechanisms: (i) hydrodynamic, (ii) free volume, and (iii) obstruction theory. Yet, a comprehensive predictive model is lacking. Thus, time and capital-intensive trial-and-error procedures are used to test the viability of hydrogel applications. In this work, we have developed a model for the diffusivity of solutes in hydrogels combining the three main theoretical frameworks, which we call the multiscale diffusion model (MSDM). We verified the MSDM by analyzing the diffusivity of dextran of different sizes in a series of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels with distinct mesh sizes. We measured the subnanoscopic free volume by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) to characterize the physical hierarchy of these materials. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis of literature data from previous studies on the diffusion of solutes in hydrogels. The model presented outperforms traditional models in predicting solute diffusivity in hydrogels and provides a practical approach to predicting the transport properties of solutes such as drugs through hydrogels used in many biomedical applications.",

Here, we show that systems conserving the dipole moment of an associated global charge, or even higher-moment generalizations thereof, escape this scenario, displaying subdiffusive decay instead. Modeling the time evolution as cellular automata for specific cases of dipole- and quadrupole conservation, we numerically find distinct anomalous exponents of the late time relaxation. We explain these findings by analytically constructing a general hydrodynamic model that results in a series of exponents depending on the number of conserved moments, yielding an accurate description of the scaling form of charge correlation functions. We analyze the spatial profile of the correlations and discuss potential experimentally relevant signatures of higher-moment conservation.",

        "abstract": "This article discusses the recent literature on policy diffusion and puts forward a new articulation of its political dimensions. Policy diffusion means that policies in one unit (country, state, city, etc.) are influenced by the policies of other units. The diffusion literature conceptualises these interdependencies with four mechanisms: learning, competition, coercion and emulation. The article identifies a model of diffusion that is dominant in the diffusion literature. According to this model, policies spread because decision makers evaluate the policy implications of the actions of other units. It is argued that the role of politics remains in the background in this model, and the article shows how going beyond a narrow focus on policy adoptions helps us to consider the politics of policy diffusion more explicitly.",

However, literature overviews on the information diffusion of Twitter analytics are sparse, especially on the use of continuous time Markov chain (CTMC). This paper examines the following topics: (1) the purposes of studies about information diffusion on Twitter, (2) the methods adopted to model information diffusion on Twitter, (3) the metrics applied, and (4) measures used to determine influencer rankings. We employed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the studies related to information diffusion on Twitter extracted from four digital libraries. In this paper, a two-stage analysis was conducted. First, we implemented a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix software. This approach was applied to select 204 papers after conducting a duplication check and assessing the inclusion–exclusion criteria. At this stage, we mapped the authors’ collaborative networks/collaborators and the evolution of research themes. Second, we analyzed the gap in research themes on the application of CTMC information diffusion on Twitter. Further filtering criteria were applied, and 34 papers were analyzed to identify the research objectives, methods, metrics, and measures used by each researcher. Nonhomogeneous CTMC has never been used in Twitter information diffusion modeling. This finding motivates us to further study nonhomogeneous CTMC as a modeling approach for Twitter information diffusion.",

This limitation can be minimized by use of vapor-fed, gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs), enabling current densities that are almost two orders of magnitude greater at the same applied cathode overpotential than what is achievable with planar electrodes in an aqueous electrolyte. The addition of porous cathode layers, however, introduces a number of parameters that need to be tuned in order to optimize the performance of the GDE cell. In this work, we develop a multiphysics model for gas diffusion electrodes for CO2 reduction and used it to investigate the interplay between species transport and electrochemical reaction kinetics. The model demonstrates how the local environment near the catalyst layer, which is a function of the operating conditions, affects cell performance. We also examine the effects of catalyst layer hydrophobicity, loading, porosity, and electrolyte flowrate to help guide experimental design of vapor-fed CO2 reduction cells.",

        "abstract": "Significance For living cells to function, proteins must efficiently navigate the densely packed cytosol. Protein diffusion is slowed down by high viscosity and can come to a complete halt because of nonspecific binding and aggregation. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we develop a detailed description of protein diffusion in concentrated protein solution. We confirm that soluble proteins in concentrated solutions diffuse not as isolated particles, but as members of transient clusters between which they constantly exchange. Nonspecific protein binding and the formation of dynamic clusters nearly quantitatively account for the high viscosity and slow diffusivity in concentrated protein solutions, consistent with the Stokes–Einstein relations. We develop a detailed description of protein translational and rotational diffusion in concentrated solution on the basis of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent. Our systems contain up to 540 fully flexible proteins with 3.6 million atoms. In concentrated protein solutions (100 mg/mL and higher), the proteins ubiquitin and lysozyme, as well as the protein domains third IgG-binding domain of protein G and villin headpiece, diffuse not as isolated particles, but as members of transient clusters between which they constantly exchange. A dynamic cluster model nearly quantitatively explains the increase in viscosity and the decrease in protein diffusivity with protein volume fraction, which both exceed the predictions from widely used colloid models. The Stokes–Einstein relations for translational and rotational diffusion remain valid, but the effective hydrodynamic radius grows linearly with protein volume fraction. This increase follows the observed increase in cluster size and explains the more dramatic slowdown of protein rotation compared with translation. Baxter’s sticky-sphere model of colloidal suspensions captures the concentration dependence of cluster size, viscosity, and rotational and translational diffusion. The consistency between simulations and experiments for a diverse set of soluble globular proteins indicates that the cluster model applies broadly to concentrated protein solutions, with equilibrium dissociation constants for nonspecific protein–protein binding in the Kd ≈ 10-mM regime.",

        "title": "Single particle diffusion characterization by deep learning",
        "abstract": "Diffusion plays a crucial role in many biological processes including signaling, cellular organization, transport mechanisms, and more. Direct observation of molecular movement by single-particle tracking experiments has contributed to a growing body of evidence that many cellular systems do not exhibit classical Brownian motion, but rather anomalous diffusion. Despite this evidence, characterization of the physical process underlying anomalous diffusion remains a challenging problem for several reasons. First, different physical processes can exist simultaneously in a system. Second, commonly used tools to distinguish between these processes are based on asymptotic behavior, which is inaccessible experimentally in most cases. Finally, an accurate analysis of the diffusion model requires the calculation of many observables, since different transport modes can result in the same diffusion power-law α, that is obtained from the commonly used mean-squared-displacement (MSD) in its various forms. The outstanding challenge in the field is to develop a method to extract an accurate assessment of the diffusion process using many short trajectories with a simple scheme that is applicable at the non-expert level. Here, we use deep learning to infer the underlying process resulting in anomalous diffusion. We implement a neural network to classify single particle trajectories according to diffusion type – Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion (FBM) and Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW). We further use the net to estimate the Hurst exponent for FBM, and the diffusion coefficient for Brownian motion, demonstrating its applicability on simulated and experimental data. The networks outperform time averaged MSD analysis on simulated trajectories while requiring as few as 25 time-steps. Furthermore, when tested on experimental data, both network and ensemble MSD analysis converge to similar values, with the network requiring half the trajectories required for ensemble MSD. Finally, we use the nets to extract diffusion parameters from multiple extremely short trajectories (10 steps).",

However, so far nanocrystal (NC) systems supported only diffusion lengths of 30 nm, which are too small to be useful in devices. Here, we demonstrate a FRET-mediated exciton diffusion length of 200 nm with 0.5 cm2/s diffusivity through an ordered, two-dimensional assembly of cesium lead bromide perovskite nanocrystals (CsPbBr3 PNCs). Exciton diffusion was directly measured via steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) microscopy, with physical modeling providing deeper insight into the transport process. This exceptionally efficient exciton transport is facilitated by PNCs' high PL quantum yield, large absorption cross-section, and high polarizability, together with minimal energetic and geometric disorder of the assembly. This FRET-mediated exciton diffusion length matches perovskites' optical absorption depth, thus enabling the design of device architectures with improved performances, and providing insight into the high conversion efficiencies of PNC-based optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Although not readily accessible yet to many community and hospital pharmacists, fuse deposition modelling (FDM) is a 3D printing technique that can be used to create a 3D pharmaceutical dosage form by employing drug loaded filaments extruded via a nozzle, melted and deposited layer by layer. FDM requires printable filaments, which are commonly manufactured by hot melt extrusion, and identifying a suitable extrudable drug-excipient mixture can sometimes be challenging. We propose here the use of passive diffusion as an accessible loading method for filaments that can be printed using FDM technology to allow for the fabrication of oral personalised medicines in clinical settings. Utilising Hansen Solubility Parameters (HSP) and the concept of HSP distances (Ra) between drug, solvent, and filament, we have developed a facile pre-screening tool for the selection of the optimal combination that can provide a high drug loading (a high solvent-drug Ra, >10, and an intermediate solvent–filament Ra value, ~10). We have identified that other parameters such as surface roughness and stiffness also play a key role in enhancing passive diffusion of the drug into the filaments. A predictive model for drug loading was developed based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) regression and indicated a strong correlation between both Ra and filament stiffness and the diffusion capacity of a model BCS Class II drug, nifedipine (NFD), into the filaments. A drug loading, close to 3% w/w, was achieved. 3D printed tablets prepared using a PVA-derived filament (Hydrosupport, 3D Fuel) showed promising characteristics in terms of dissolution (with a sustained release over 24 h) and predicted chemical stability (>3 years at 25 °C/60% relative humidity), similar to commercially available NFD oral dosage forms. We believe FDM coupled with passive diffusion could be implemented easily in clinical settings for the manufacture of tailored personalised medicines, which can be stored over long periods of time (similar to industrially manufactured solid dosage forms).",

With the success of deep learning techniques, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have shown their powerful capability in modeling information diffusion as sequential data. However, previous works focused on either microscopic diffusion prediction which aims at guessing the next influenced user or macroscopic diffusion prediction which estimates the total numbers of influenced users during the diffusion process. To the best of our knowledge, no previous works have suggested a unified model for both microscopic and macroscopic scales. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale diffusion prediction model based on reinforcement learning (RL). RL incorporates the macroscopic diffusion size information into the RNN-based microscopic diffusion model by addressing the non-differentiable problem. We also employ an effective structural context extraction strategy to utilize the underlying social graph information. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models on both microscopic and macroscopic diffusion predictions on three real-world datasets.",

        "abstract": "A well-established notion in cognitive neuroscience proposes that multiple brain systems contribute to choice behaviour. These include: (1) a model-free system that uses values cached from the outcome history of alternative actions, and (2) a model-based system that considers action outcomes and the transition structure of the environment. The widespread use of this distinction, across a range of applications, renders it important to index their distinct influences with high reliability. Here we consider the two-stage task, widely considered as a gold standard measure for the contribution of model-based and model-free systems to human choice. We tested the internal/temporal stability of measures from this task, including those estimated via an established computational model, as well as an extended model using drift-diffusion. Drift-diffusion modeling suggested that both choice in the first stage, and RTs in the second stage, are directly affected by a model-based/free trade-off parameter. Both parameter recovery and the stability of model-based estimates were poor but improved substantially when both choice and RT were used (compared to choice only), and when more trials (than conventionally used in research practice) were included in our analysis. The findings have implications for interpretation of past and future studies based on the use of the two-stage task, as well as for characterising the contribution of model-based processes to choice behaviour.",

At the boundary of the surface, no slip and zero mass flux condition are implemented to control the nanoparticle volume fraction at surface.

Variation in flow properties due to parameters involved is presented graphically and through tabular values. The effect of thermal radiation and thermal relaxation parameter is to increase heat transfer. The temperature of nanofluid and drag force at surface increases due to enhanced magnetic field.

Finally, the study compared and analyzed the heterogeneous effects of different types of environmental regulation tools on the diffusion of green technology innovation in manufacturing enterprises using local stability analysis and numerical simulation. The results are as follows: (i) When the government does not implement environmental regulation tools or the regulation intensity is relatively small, the diffusion depth of green technology innovation in manufacturing enterprises is zero. (ii) When government regulation reaches a certain level, the system of manufacturing enterprises, innovation-supplying enterprises, and potential demand-oriented enterprises will choose to actively promote the diffusion of green technology innovation following a long evolution process. (iii) Increasing the punishment intensity and subsidy rate of green technology innovation can stimulate the diffusion of green technology innovation in manufacturing enterprises. (iv) The comprehensive use of the two kinds of environmental regulation tools has a heterogeneous influence on the strategic choice of green technology innovation diffusion subjects of manufacturing enterprises, and its incentive effect on potential demand-oriented enterprises is relatively poor.",

In this new model, the Fourier and the Fick laws have been modified to include a higher time-fractional order of the heat conduction vector, the gradient of temperature, the diffusing mass flux and the gradient of chemical potential. We adopted the definitions of Caputo and Jumarie; for time-fractional derivatives.

Applying this formulation, we have discussed a thermoelastic-diffusion problem for a half-space exposed to thermal and chemical shock with a permeable material in contact with the half-surface.

        "abstract": "Significance We develop a physics-based earthquake-forecasting model for evaluating seismic hazard due to fluid injection, considering both pore pressure and poroelastic stresses. Applying this model to complex settings like Oklahoma, we show that the regional induced earthquake timing and magnitude are controlled by the process of fluid diffusion in a poroelastic medium, and thus seismicity can be successfully forecasted by using a rate-and-state earthquake nucleation model. We find that pore-pressure diffusion controls the induced earthquakes in Oklahoma. However, its impact is enhanced by poroelastic effects. This finding has significant implications for induced earthquake-forecasting efforts by integrating the physics of fluid diffusion and earthquake nucleation. Induced seismicity linked to geothermal resource exploitation, hydraulic fracturing, and wastewater disposal is evolving into a global issue because of the increasing energy demand. Moderate to large induced earthquakes, causing widespread hazards, are often related to fluid injection into deep permeable formations that are hydraulically connected to the underlying crystalline basement. Using injection data combined with a physics-based linear poroelastic model and rate-and-state friction law, we compute the changes in crustal stress and seismicity rate in Oklahoma. This model can be used to assess earthquake potential on specific fault segments. The regional magnitude–time distribution of the observed magnitude (M) 3+ earthquakes during 2008–2017 is reproducible and is the same for the 2 optimal, conjugate fault orientations suggested for Oklahoma. At the regional scale, the timing of predicted seismicity rate, as opposed to its pattern and amplitude, is insensitive to hydrogeological and nucleation parameters in Oklahoma. Poroelastic stress changes alone have a small effect on the seismic hazard. However, their addition to pore-pressure changes can increase the seismicity rate by 6-fold and 2-fold for central and western Oklahoma, respectively. The injection-rate reduction in 2016 mitigates the exceedance probability of M5.0 by 22% in western Oklahoma, while that of central Oklahoma remains unchanged. A hypothetical injection shut-in in April 2017 causes the earthquake probability to approach its background level by ∼2025. We conclude that stress perturbation on prestressed faults due to pore-pressure diffusion, enhanced by poroelastic effects, is the primary driver of the induced earthquakes in Oklahoma.",

The in-vitro drug release profile was carried out in 0.1 N HCl (900 mL) using USP dissolution apparatus II (Paddle) at 50 rpm at an extended time period of 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3 and 4 hours.

Zero order model, first order model, Higuchi model, Hixson-Crowell model and Korsmeyer-Peppas model and evaluated to understand the kinetics of drug release. The criterion for the most suitable model was based on the high degree of coefficient of correlation of drug release profile of Carbidopa Levodopa ER Tablet.

        "abstract": "Coupling a many-body system to a thermal environment typically destroys the quantum coherence of its state, leading to an effective classical dynamics at the longest time scales. We show that systems with anyon-like defects can exhibit universal late-time dynamics that is stochastic, but fundamentally non-classical, because some of the quantum information about the state is topologically protected from the environment. \nOur coarse-grained model describes one-dimensional systems with domain-wall defects carrying Majorana modes. These defects undergo Brownian motion due to coupling with a bath. Since the fermion parity of a given pair of defects is nonlocal, it cannot be measured by the bath until the two defects happen to come into contact. We examine how such a system anneals to zero temperature via the diffusion and pairwise annihilation of Majorana defects, and we characterize the nontrivial entanglement structure that arises in such stochastic processes. \nSeparately, we also investigate simplified \"quantum measurement circuits\" in one or more dimensions, involving repeated pairwise measurement of fermion parities for a lattice of Majoranas. The dynamics of these circuits can be solved by exact mappings to classical loop models. They yield analytically tractable examples of measurement-induced phase transitions, with critical entanglement structures that are governed by nonunitary conformal fixed points. \nIn the system of diffusing and annihilating Majorana defects, the relaxation to the ground state is analogous to coarsening in a classical 1D Ising model via domain wall annihilation. Here, however, configurations are labeled not only by the defect positions but by a nonlocal entanglement structure. The resulting dynamical process is a new universality class for the coarsening of topological domain walls, whose universal properties can be obtained from an exact mapping.",

Despite its importance in genome editing, aspects of the precise molecular mechanism of Cas9 activity remain ambiguous. In particular, because of the lack of a method with high spatio‐temporal resolution, transient interactions between Cas9 and DNA could not be reliably investigated. It therefore remains controversial how Cas9 searches for protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences. We have developed single‐molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) assays to monitor transient interactions of Cas9 and DNA in real time. Our study shows that Cas9 interacts with the PAM sequence weakly, yet probing neighboring sequences via facilitated diffusion. This dynamic mode of interactions leads to translocation of Cas9 to another PAM nearby and consequently an on‐target sequence. We propose a model in which lateral diffusion competes with three‐dimensional diffusion and thus is involved in PAM finding and consequently on‐target binding. Our results imply that the neighboring sequences can be very important when choosing a target in genetic engineering applications.",

The complexity of user behavior, multidimensionality of the communication space, imbalance of the data samples, and symbiosis and competition between rumor and anti-rumor are challenges associated with the in-depth study on rumor communication. Given these challenges, this study proposes a group behavior model for rumor and anti-rumor. First, this study considers the diversity and complexity of the rumor propagation feature space and the advantages of representation learning in the feature extraction of data. Further, we adopt the corresponding representation learning methods for their content and structure of the rumor and anti-rumor to reduce the spatial feature dimension of the rumor-spreading data and to uniformly and densely express the full-featured information feature representation. Second, this paper introduces an evolutionary game theory, which is combined with the user-influenced rumor and anti-rumor, to reflect the conflict and symbiotic relationship between rumor and anti-rumor. we obtain a network structural feature expression of the influence degree of users on rumor and anti-rumor when expressing the structural characteristics of group communication relationships. Finally, aiming at the timeliness of rumor topic evolution, the whole model is proposed. Time slice and discretize the life cycle of rumor is used to synthesize the full-featured information feature representation of rumor and anti-rumor. The experiments denote that the model can not only effectively analyze user group behavior regarding rumor but also accurately reflect the competition and symbiotic relation between rumor and anti-rumor diffusion.",

We interpret our results as a consequence of local quantum fluctuations in conserved densities, whose behavior is controlled by diffusion, and use the random circuit model to derive an effective description.

        "abstract": "Photon recycling and carrier diffusion are the two plausible processes that primarily affect the carrier dynamics in halide perovskites, and therefore the evaluation of the performance of their photovoltaic and photonic devices. However, it is still challenging to isolate their individual contributions because both processes result in a similar emission redshift. Herein, it is confirmed that photon recycling is the dominant effect responsible for the observed redshifted emission. By applying one‐ and two‐photon confocal emission microscopy on Ruddlesden–Popper type 2D perovskites, of which interplane carrier diffusion is strictly suppressed, the substantial PL redshift (72 meV) is well reproduced by the photon transport model. A comparison of 3D bulk CH3NH3PbBr3 single crystal to 2D perovskite by depth‐resolved two‐photon PL spectra reveals the contribution of carrier diffusion on energy transport at a distance beyond diffusion length is constantly negligible, though the carrier diffusion indeed exists in the 3D crystal. The investigation resolves the fundamental confusion and debate surrounding the issue and provides significant insights into carrier kinetics in perovskites, which is important for future developments in solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.",

        "abstract": "Building on a critical engagement with the diffusion literature, this article introduces a refined model of diffusion that sheds light on crucial but so far neglected aspects of the diffusion process. First, by introducing four analytically distinct constellations of diffusion, we highlight important differences between the participating units of a diffusion process. Therefore, the model also allows for analysing very early developments of social policy under the conditions of colonialism and relations between states of equal or different economic strength, and under conditions of continuing post-colonial ties. Second, we conceptualize diffusion as consisting of three stages which involve different actors from both units: the stage of perception and translation, the stage of cooperation and conflict and the stage of collective decision-making. Third, we argue that the dominant focus of diffusion research on the macro-level obscures that people, money and procedures are key promoters of diffusion. From this refined model of diffusion, it becomes possible to analyse diffusion processes in a more detailed way. We demonstrate the added value of our model by analysing the development of education policy in Chile and Argentina in the 19th century, and the establishment of project funding for social policy purposes under conditions of colonialism in the British Empire in the mid-20th century.",

As a particular case, we consider the following diffusion problem where [u]s is the Gagliardo seminorm of u, is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, is the fractional Laplacian with , is the initial function, and is continuous. Under some appropriate conditions, the local existence of nonnegative solutions is obtained by employing the Galerkin method. Then, by virtue of a differential inequality technique, we prove that the local nonnegative solutions blow-up in finite time with arbitrary negative initial energy and suitable initial values. Moreover, we give an estimate for the lower and upper bounds of the blow-up time. The main novelty is that our results cover the degenerate case, that is, the coefficient of could be zero at the origin.",

        "abstract": "Many of the purported virtues of Multi-Principal Element Alloys (MPEAs), such as corrosion, high-temperature oxidation and irradiation resistance, are highly sensitive to vacancy diffusivity. Similarly, solute interdiffusion is governed by vacancy diffusion -- it is often unclear whether MPEAs are truly stable, or effectively stabilized by slow interdiffusion. The considerable composition space afforded to these alloys makes optimizing for desired properties a daunting task; theoretical and computational tools are necessary to guide alloy development. For diffusion, such tools depend on both a knowledge of the vacancy migration barriers within a given alloy and an understanding of how these barriers influence vacancy diffusivity. We present a generalized theory of vacancy diffusion in rugged energy landscapes, paired with Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of MPEA vacancy diffusion. The barrier energy statistics are informed by nudged elastic band calculations in the equiatomic CoNiCrFeMn alloy. Theory and simulations show that vacancy diffusion in solid-solution MPEAs is not necessarily sluggish, but can potentially be tuned, and that trap models are an insufficient explanation for sluggish diffusion in the CoNiCrFeMn HEA. These results also show that any model that endeavors to faithfully represent diffusion-related phenomena must account for the full nature of the energy landscape, not just the migration barriers.",

Such processes yield anomalous diffusion and weak ergodicity breaking, the asymptotic disparity between ensemble and time averaged observables, such as the mean-squared displacement. Fractional Brownian motion (FBM) with its long-range correlated yet Gaussian increments gives rise to anomalous and ergodic diffusion. Here, we study a combined model of HDPs and FBM to describe the particle dynamics in complex systems with position-dependent diffusivity driven by fractional Gaussian noise. This type of motion is, inter alia, relevant for tracer-particle diffusion in biological cells or heterogeneous complex fluids. We show that the long-time scaling behavior predicted theoretically and by simulations for the ensemble- and time-averaged mean-squared displacements couple the scaling exponents α of HDPs and the Hurst exponent H of FBM in a characteristic way. Our analysis of the simulated data in terms of the rescaled variable y∼|x|^{1/(2/(2-α))}/t^{H} coupling particle position x and time t yields a simple, Gaussian probability density function (PDF), P_{HDP-FBM}(y)=e^{-y^{2}}/sqrt[π].

Still, there is dearth of research regarding organisational diffusion (post-adoption) of TQM. To address this gap, this research proposes a theoretical model rooted in institutional and upper echelon theories that explain TQM diffusion via top management commitment. We surveyed 300 senior quality managers representing 300 auto-components manufacturers in India to collect data to test the proposed model using variance based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The findings suggest that institutional pressures significantly influence top management commitment to TQM. Subsequently, top management commitment influences organisational diffusion of TQM via acceptance, routinisation and assimilation. Managers can use the findings of this research to better understand how to assimilate TQM so that anticipated benefits can be fully realised.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion MRI fiber tractography has been increasingly used to map the structural connectivity of the human brain. However, this technique is not without limitations; for example, there is a growing concern over anatomically correlated bias in tractography findings. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a bias for fiber tracking algorithms to terminate preferentially on gyral crowns, rather than the banks of sulci. We investigate this issue by comparing diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography with equivalent measures made on myelin‐stained histological sections. We begin by investigating the orientation and trajectories of axons near the white matter/gray matter boundary, and the density of axons entering the cortex at different locations along gyral blades. These results are compared with dMRI orientations and tract densities at the same locations, where we find a significant gyral bias in many gyral blades across the brain. This effect is shown for a range of tracking algorithms, both deterministic and probabilistic, and multiple diffusion models, including the diffusion tensor and a high angular resolution diffusion imaging technique. Additionally, the gyral bias occurs for a range of diffusion weightings, and even for very high‐resolution datasets. The bias could significantly affect connectivity results using the current generation of tracking algorithms.",

The ultrafast response of metals to light is governed by intriguing nonequilibrium dynamics involving the interplay of excited electrons and phonons. The coupling between them leads to nonlinear diffusion behavior on ultrashort time scales. Here, we use scanning ultrafast thermomodulation microscopy to image the spatiotemporal hot-electron diffusion in thin gold films. By tracking local transient reflectivity with 20-nm spatial precision and 0.25-ps temporal resolution, we reveal two distinct diffusion regimes: an initial rapid diffusion during the first few picoseconds, followed by about 100-fold slower diffusion at longer times. We find a slower initial diffusion than previously predicted for purely electronic diffusion. We develop a comprehensive three-dimensional model based on a two-temperature model and evaluation of the thermo-optical response, taking into account the delaying effect of electron-phonon coupling. Our simulations describe well the observed diffusion dynamics and let us identify the two diffusion regimes as hot-electron and phonon-limited thermal diffusion, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Increasing the loading of active materials by thickening the battery electrode coating can enhance the energy density of a Li-ion cell, but the trade-off is the much reduced Li+ transport kinetics. To reach the optimum energy and power density for thick electrodes, the effective chemical diffusion coefficient of Li+ ( DLi) must be maximized. However, the diffusion of Li+ inside an electrode is a complex process involving both microscopic and macroscopic processes. Fundamental understandings are needed on the rate-limiting process that governs the diffusion kinetics of Li+ to minimize the negative impact of the large electrode thickness on their electrochemical performance. In this work, lithium Ni-Mn-Co oxide (NMC) cathodes of various thicknesses ranging from 100 to 300 μm were used as a model system to study the rate-limiting diffusion process during charge/discharge. The rate-limiting diffusion coefficient of Li+ was investigated and quantified, which was correlated to the electrochemical performance degradation of thick electrodes. It is revealed here that the under-utilization of the active material was caused by the limited diffusion of Li+ inside the porous electrode, leading to a critical electrode thickness, beyond which the specific capacity was significantly reduced.",

Here we reinvestigate it by focusing on isotropic antiferromagnetic chains whose low-energy effective field theory is governed by the quantum nonlinear sigma model. Employing an exact nonperturbative theoretical approach, we analyze the low-temperature behavior in the vicinity of nonmagnetized states and obtain exact expressions for the spin diffusion constant and the NMR relaxation rate, which we compare with previous theoretical results in the literature. Surprisingly, in SU(2)-invariant spin chains in the vicinity of half filling we find a crossover from the semiclassical regime to a strongly interacting quantum regime characterized by zero spin Drude weight and diverging spin conductivity, indicating superdiffusive spin dynamics. The dynamical exponent of spin fluctuations is argued to belong to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. Furthermore, by employing numerical time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations, we find robust evidence that the anomalous spin transport persists also at high temperatures, irrespective of the spectral gap and integrability of the model.",

        "title": "A Meta-analysis of the Diagnostic Performance of Diffusion MRI for Breast Lesion Characterization.",
        "abstract": "Background Various techniques are available to assess diffusion properties of breast lesions as a marker of malignancy at MRI. The diagnostic performance of these diffusion markers has not been comprehensively assessed. Purpose To compare by meta-analysis the diagnostic performance of parameters from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI), and intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) in the differential diagnosis of malignant and benign breast lesions. Materials and Methods PubMed and Embase databases were searched from January to March 2018 for studies in English that assessed the diagnostic performance of DWI, DTI, and IVIM in the breast. Studies were reviewed according to eligibility and exclusion criteria. Publication bias and heterogeneity between studies were assessed. Pooled summary estimates for sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve were obtained for each parameter by using a bivariate model. A subanalysis investigated the effect of MRI parameters on diagnostic performance by using a Student t test or a one-way analysis of variance. Results From 73 eligible studies, 6791 lesions (3930 malignant and 2861 benign) were included. Publication bias was evident for studies that evaluated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Significant heterogeneity (P < .05) was present for all parameters except the perfusion fraction (f). The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve for ADC was 89%, 82%, and 0.92, respectively. The highest performing parameter for DTI was the prime diffusion coefficient (λ1), and pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve was 93%, 90%, and 0.94, respectively. The highest performing parameter for IVIM was tissue diffusivity (D), and the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve was 88%, 79%, and 0.90. Choice of MRI parameters had no significant effect on diagnostic performance. Conclusion Diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion-tensor imaging, and intravoxel incoherent motion have comparable diagnostic accuracy with high sensitivity and specificity. Intravoxel incoherent motion is comparable to apparent diffusion coefficient. Diffusion-tensor imaging is potentially promising but to date the number of studies is limited. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.",

        "abstract": "The diffusion decision model (DDM) has been used to investigate the effects of aging on information processing in simple response time (RT) tasks. These analyses have consistently shown that the age-related slowing of RTs can be accounted for by slower processing speed in sensorimotor systems and more cautious responding. However, previous DDM assessments of aging have ignored conflict tasks (e.g., the flanker task), the dominant paradigm for investigating age-related differences in executive control, as the DDM is unable to combine task-relevant and task-irrelevant stimulus information. Our study used two recently developed extensions of the DDM-the diffusion model for conflict tasks (DMC) and the shrinking spotlight diffusion model (SSP)-to provide the first model-based assessment of age-related differences in a flanker task featuring a manipulation of the spacing between target and flanking letters. Consistent with previous findings, older adults were globally slower than younger adults, and the magnitude of the flanker effect was larger for older than younger adults only when the spacing between the target and flanking letters was small. Fits of the models to data revealed a superiority of the DMC over the SSP. The DMC accounts for experimental findings with a 62-ms slowing of the nondecision component of RT for older compared to younger adults, a more cautious decision criterion, and enhanced processing of the target and flanking letters in the near periphery, suggesting a stronger attentional engagement in the task.

        "abstract": "This paper advocates a novel video saliency detection method based on the spatial-temporal saliency fusion and low-rank coherency guided saliency diffusion. In sharp contrast to the conventional methods, which conduct saliency detection locally in a frame-by-frame way and could easily give rise to incorrect low-level saliency map, in order to overcome the existing difficulties, this paper proposes to fuse the color saliency based on global motion clues in a batch-wise fashion. And we also propose low-rank coherency guided spatial-temporal saliency diffusion to guarantee the temporal smoothness of saliency maps. Meanwhile, a series of saliency boosting strategies are designed to further improve the saliency accuracy. First, the original long-term video sequence is equally segmented into many short-term frame batches, and the motion clues of the individual video batch are integrated and diffused temporally to facilitate the computation of color saliency. Then, based on the obtained saliency clues, inter-batch saliency priors are modeled to guide the low-level saliency fusion. After that, both the raw color information and the fused low-level saliency are regarded as the low-rank coherency clues, which are employed to guide the spatial-temporal saliency diffusion with the help of an additional permutation matrix serving as the alternative rank selection strategy. Thus, it could guarantee the robustness of the saliency map’s temporal consistence, and further boost the accuracy of the computed saliency map. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on five public available benchmarks, and make comprehensive, quantitative evaluations between our method and 16 state-of-the-art techniques. All the results demonstrate the superiority of our method in accuracy, reliability, robustness, and versatility.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The rapid decarbonisation of transportation is critical if global efforts to mitigate the worst possible impacts of anthropogenic climate change are to be successful. Transportation is a leading sectoral contributor of greenhouse gas emissions, and demand for transportation continues to grow globally. Alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) powered by fuels such as electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels promise to mitigate the environmental impacts of automotive transportation, including urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. However, multiple barriers to AFV diffusion exist, including low consumer acceptance, high vehicle costs, and a lack of refuelling infrastructure, meaning that sophisticated policies and strategies will be needed to achieve an AFV market transition that is both ecologically and economically sustainable. While more EVs were sold in 2018 than ever before, these sales were the result of aggressive policy support in places such as China and Norway, and it is not clear that EV sales would persist at this level if these policies were removed. In this paper, we present and make freely available a generalised model of AFV diffusion that is flexible for the exploration of these critical policy questions, building on recent AFV diffusion literature from system dynamics and related fields. We demonstrate using illustrative scenarios the fragility of AFV diffusion, with a range of behaviour modes possible depending on the structure of the market and the actions of stakeholders. Finally, we identify a number of contemporary research topics of interest to automotive manufacturers and policymakers that can be addressed using the model.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article, a novel model of the magneto-thermoelasticity theory is introduced in the context of the photothermal transport process. The chemical action and initial stress (IS) have been used to describe the mass diffusion during the magneto-photothermal diffusion (MPD) theory. The basic idea depends on the study on the coupling between plasma waves (which describe the quasi-particles of materials), the elastic waves (which describe the change of strains) and the thermal waves (which describe temperature fields). The study focuses on the impact of the chemical potential through the diffusive material concentration process of the circular plate. The one-dimensional Laplace transform is used to obtain the main physical fields under investigation. The mechanical-thermal-strain-plasma loads are applied on the cylindrical surface to determine the exact solution of physical fields. The Laplace transformation inversion is used numerically based on the Fourier expansion method. Physical quantities of silicon (which is an example of a polymer nano-composite semiconductor) are numerically calculated and graphically presented and theoretically discussed. Some comparisons are made to illustrate the results.",

        "abstract": "Despite the importance of cell wall diffusion to nearly all aspects of wood utilization, diffusion mechanisms and the detailed effects of moisture remain poorly understood. In this perspective, we introduce and employ approaches established in polymer science to develop a phenomenological framework for understanding the effects of moisture on diffusion in unmodified wood cell walls. The premise for applying this polymer-science-based approach to wood is that wood polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin) behave like typical solid polymers. Therefore, the movement of chemicals through wood cell walls is a diffusion process through a solid polymer, which is in contrast to previous assertions that transport of some chemicals occurs via aqueous pathways in the cell wall layers. Diffusion in polymers depends on the interrelations between free volume in the polymer matrix, molecular motions of the polymer, diffusant dimensions, and solubility of the diffusant in the polymer matrix. Because diffusion strongly depends on whether a polymer is in a rigid glassy state or soft rubbery state, it is important to understand glass transitions in the amorphous wood polymers. Through a review and analysis of available literature, we conclude that in wood both lignin and the amorphous polysaccharides very likely have glass transitions. After developing and presenting this polymer-science-based perspective of diffusion through unmodified wood cell walls, suggested directions for future research are discussed. A key consideration is that a large difference between diffusion through wood polymers and typical polymers is the high swelling pressures that can develop in unmodified wood cell walls. This pressure likely arises from the hierarchical structure of wood and should be taken into consideration in the development of predictive models for diffusion in unmodified wood cell walls.",

In particular, we aim at estimating the probability of an inactive node to be activated next in a cascade. Despite the success of recent deep learning methods for diffusion, we find that they often underexplore the cascade structure. We consider a cascade as not merely a sequence of nodes ordered by their activation time stamps; instead, it has a richer structure indicating the diffusion process over the data graph. As a result, we introduce a new data model, namely diffusion topologies, to fully describe the cascade structure. We find it challenging to model diffusion topologies, which are dynamic directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), with the existing neural networks. Therefore, we propose a novel topological recurrent neural network, namely Topo-LSTM, for modeling dynamic DAGs. We customize Topo-LSTM for the diffusion prediction task, and show it improves the state-of-the-art baselines, by 20.1%-56.6% (MAP) relatively, across multiple real-world data sets.",

The stochastic resetting process in Evans–Majumdar sense has several applications in science, with a particular emphasis on non-equilibrium physics and biological systems. We propose a version of the stochastic resetting theory for systems in which the reset point is in motion, so the walker does not return to the initial position as in the standard model, but returns to a point that moves in space. In addition, we investigate the proposed stochastic resetting model for diffusion with the fractional operator of Prabhakar. The derivative of Prabhakar consists of an integro-differential operator that has a Mittag–Leffler function with three parameters in the integration kernel, so it generalizes a series of fractional operators such as Riemann–Liouville–Caputo. We present how the generalized model of stochastic resetting for fractional diffusion implies a rich class of anomalous diffusive processes, i.e., ⟨ ( Δ x ) 2 ⟩ ∝ t α , which includes sub-super-hyper-diffusive regimes. In the sequence, we generalize these ideas to the fractional Fokker–Planck equation for quadratic potential U ( x ) = a x 2 + b x + c . This work aims to present the generalized model of Evans–Majumdar’s theory for stochastic resetting under a new perspective of non-static restart points.",

The distribution of displacements of such proteins is observed to take a q-Gaussian form, which decays as a power law. Here, a statistical model is developed for the diffusive motion of the proteins within the bacterium, based on a superstatistics with two variables. This model hierarchically takes into account the joint fluctuations of both the anomalous diffusion exponents and the diffusion constants.

        "abstract": "The generalized diffusion equations with fractional order derivatives have shown be quite efficient to describe the diffusion in complex systems, with the advantage of producing exact expressions for the underlying diffusive properties. Recently, researchers have proposed different fractional-time operators (namely: the Caputo-Fabrizio and Atangana-Baleanu) which, differently from the well-known Riemann-Liouville operator, are defined by non-singular memory kernels. Here we proposed to use these new operators to generalize the usual diffusion equation. By analyzing the corresponding fractional diffusion equations within the continuous time random walk framework, we obtained waiting time distributions characterized by exponential, stretched exponential, and power-law functions, as well as a crossover between two behaviors. For the mean square displacement, we found crossovers between usual and confined diffusion, and between usual and sub-diffusion. We obtained the exact expressions for the probability distributions, where non-Gaussian and stationary distributions emerged. This former feature is remarkable because the fractional diffusion equation is solved without external forces and subjected to the free diffusion boundary conditions. We have further shown that these new fractional diffusion equations are related to diffusive processes with stochastic resetting, and to fractional diffusion equations with derivatives of distributed order. Thus, our results suggest that these new operators may be a simple and efficient way for incorporating different structural aspects into the system, opening new possibilities for modeling and investigating anomalous diffusive processes.",

        "abstract": "The success of medical therapy depends on the correct amount and the appropriate delivery of the required drugs for treatment. By using biodegradable polymers a drug delivery over a time span of weeks or even months is made possible. This opens up a variety of strategies for better medication. The drug is embedded in a biodegradable polymer (the “carrier”) and injected in a particular position of the human body. As a consequence of the interplay between the diffusion process and the degrading polymer the drug is released in a controlled manner. In this work we study the controlled release of medication experimentally by measuring the delivered amount of drug within a cylindrical shell over a long time interval into the body fluid. Moreover, a simple continuum model of the Fickean type is initially proposed and solved in closed-form. It is used for simulating some of the observed release processes for this type of carrier and takes the geometry of the drug container explicitly into account. By comparing the measurement data and the model predictions diffusion coefficients are obtained. It turns out that within this simple model the coefficients change over time. This contradicts the idea that diffusion coefficients are constants independent of the considered geometry. The model is therefore extended by taking an additional absorption term into account leading to a concentration dependent diffusion coefficient. This could now be used for further predictions of drug release in carriers of different shape. For a better understanding of the complex diffusion and degradation phenomena the underlying physics is discussed in detail and even more sophisticated models involving different degradation and mass transport phenomena are proposed for future work and study.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The quality of asphalt binder recycling is largely dependent on molecular diffusion between virgin asphalt binder, aged asphalt binder, and rejuvenator. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to study diffusion and interaction mechanism of rejuvenating agent in recycled asphalt binder. The diffusion process of rejuvenator into virgin and aged asphalt binder was studied using a three-layered model. A mixture model of virgin and aged asphalt binder was built to evaluate the effect of rejuvenator on the molecular structure of asphalt binder, such as nanoaggregate behaviour and translational mobility. The simulation results of the layered model suggest that rejuvenator may improve blending efficiency of virgin and aged asphalt binder depending on temperature. The calculated inter-diffusion coefficients indicate that the rejuvenator diffuses faster into virgin asphalt binder than aged asphalt binder. The radial distribution functions of asphaltene, resin, and aromatic pairs show that rejuvenator causes the molecular structures of virgin and aged asphalt binder more similar to that of virgin asphalt binder. The rejuvenator reduces the self-association trends of asphaltene molecules, but saturates from local aggregation inside the rejuvenated asphalt binder. On the other hand, rejuvenator increases translational mobility of saturate, aromatic, resin and asphaltene fractions.",

By means of Brownian dynamics simulations we show that, when the direction of the self-propulsion of each monomer is aligned with the backbone, the polymer undergoes a coil-to-globulelike transition, highlighted by a marked change of the scaling exponent of the gyration radius. Concurrently, the diffusion coefficient of the center of mass of the polymer becomes essentially independent of the polymer size for sufficiently long polymers or large magnitudes of the self-propulsion. These effects are reduced when the self-propulsion of the monomers is not bound to be tangent to the backbone of the polymer. Our results, rationalized by a minimal stochastic model, open new routes for activity-controlled polymers and, possibly, for a new generation of polymer-based drug carriers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Information on the rate of diffusion of organic molecules within secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is needed to accurately predict the effects of SOA on climate and air quality. Often, researchers have predicted diffusion rates of organic molecules within SOA using measurements of viscosity and the Stokes-Einstein relation (D ∝ 1/η where D is the diffusion coefficient and η is viscosity). However, the accuracy of this relation for predicting diffusion in SOA remains uncertain. We measured diffusion coefficients over eight orders in magnitude in proxies of SOA including citric acid, sorbitol, and a sucrose-citric acid mixture. These results were combined with literature data to evaluate the Stokes-Einstein relation for predicting diffusion of organic molecules in SOA. Although almost all the data agrees with the Stokes-Einstein relation within a factor of ten, a fractional Stokes-Einstein relation (D ∝ C/ηt) with t = 0.93 and C = 1.66 is a better model for predicting diffusion of organic molecules in the SOA proxies studied. In addition, based on the output from a chemical transport model, the Stokes-Einstein relation can over predict mixing times of organic molecules within SOA by as much as one order of magnitude at an altitude ~ 3 km, compared to the fractional Stokes-Einstein relation with t = 0.93 and C = 1.66. These differences can be important for predicting growth, evaporation, and reaction rates of SOA in the middle and upper part of the troposphere. These results also have implications for other areas where diffusion of organic molecules within organic-water matrices is important.\n",

The analytical model of grout diffusion is derived based on force–equilibrium principle, Darcy's law, and the law of momentum conservation of the grout. Time‐dependent grout diffusion pressure and distance are highlighted in the model. The proposed grout diffusion model is applied in two field cases: Metro Lines No. 9 and No. 4 in Shanghai City. The results show that the proposed model agrees well with the measured grout diffusion distance in the field. Parametric studies are then conducted, implying that grout diffusion distance along the radial direction of tunnel lining is proportional to either hydraulic conductivity or initial grout pressure, whereas it is in inverse proportion to the yield stress of backfill grout. The distributions of initial grout pressure exert key influences on the grout diffusion distance and grout diffusion pressure behind tunnel segment lining.",

Recently, intracellular single-molecule tracking experiments have recorded exponentially decaying propagators, a phenomenon called Laplace diffusion. Inspired by these developments we study a many-body approach, called the Hitchhiker model, providing a microscopic description of the widely observed behavior. Our model explains how Laplace diffusion is controlled by size fluctuations of single molecules, independently of the diffusion law which they follow. By means of numerical simulations Laplace diffusion is recovered and we show how single-molecule tracking and data analysis, in a many-body system, is highly nontrivial as tracking of a single particle or many in parallel yields vastly different estimates for the diffusivity. We quantify the differences between these two commonly used approaches, showing how the single-molecule estimate of diffusivity is larger if compared to the full tagging method.",

        "abstract": "The solar cycle dependence of various turbulence quantities and cosmic-ray (CR) diffusion coefficients is investigated by using OMNI 1 minute resolution data over 22 years. We employ Elsässer variables z± to calculate the magnetic field turbulence energy and correlation lengths for both the inwardly and outwardly directed interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We present the temporal evolution of both large-scale solar wind (SW) plasma variables and small-scale magnetic fluctuations. Based on these observed quantities, we study the influence of solar activity on CR parallel and perpendicular diffusion using quasi-linear theory and nonlinear guiding center theory, respectively. We also evaluate the radial evolution of the CR diffusion coefficients by using the boundary conditions for different solar activity levels. We find that in the ecliptic plane at 1 au (1), the large-scale SW temperature T, velocity Vsw, Alfvén speed VA, and IMF magnitude B0 are positively related to solar activity; (2) the fluctuating magnetic energy density , residual energy ED, and corresponding correlation functions all have an obvious solar cycle dependence. The residual energy ED is always negative, which indicates that the energy in magnetic fluctuations is larger than the energy in kinetic fluctuations, especially at solar maximum; (3) the correlation length λ for magnetic fluctuations does not show significant solar cycle variation; (4) the temporally varying shear source of turbulence, which is most important in the inner heliosphere, depends on the solar cycle; (5) small-scale fluctuations may not depend on the direction of the background magnetic field; and (6) high levels of SW fluctuations will increase CR perpendicular diffusion and decrease CR parallel diffusion, but this trend can be masked if the background IMF changes in concert with turbulence in response to solar activity. These results provide quantitative inputs for both turbulence transport models and CR diffusion models, and also provide valuable insight into the long-term modulation of CRs in the heliosphere.",

One natural way to understand how user tracking data moves through this interconnected advertising ecosystem is by modeling it as a graph. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph representation, called an Inclusion graph, to model the impact of RTB on the diffusion of user tracking data in the advertising ecosystem. Through simulations on the Inclusion graph, we provide upper and lower estimates on the tracking information observed by A&A companies. We find that 52 A&A companies observe at least 91% of an average user’s browsing history under reasonable assumptions about information sharing within RTB auctions. We also evaluate the effectiveness of blocking strategies (e.g., AdBlock Plus), and find that major A&A companies still observe 40–90% of user impressions, depending on the blocking strategy.",

On the basis of the weighted R&D network, the multiple factors of knowledge diffusion efficiency are analyzed, and then a novel measurement method is proposed by comprehensively embodying these factors. Furthermore, an extended application of the measurement method is proposed to identify the important members of R&D network. An example of weighted Braess network and a real-world case are employed to illustrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. Results show that the proposed measurement method can more efficiently and accurately measure the knowledge diffusion efficiency of R&D networks than the traditional methods, and its application can effectively identify the important members with great influence on knowledge diffusion.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion with stochastic resetting has recently emerged as a powerful modeling tool with a myriad of potential applications. Here, we study local time in this model, covering situations of free and biased diffusion with, and without, the presence of an absorbing boundary. Given a Brownian trajectory that evolved for t units of time, the local time is simply defined as the total time the trajectory spent in a small vicinity of its initial position. However, as Brownian trajectories are stochastic—the local time itself is a random variable which fluctuates round and about its mean value. In the past, the statistics of these fluctuations has been quantified in detail; but not in the presence of resetting which biases the particle to spend more time near its starting point. Here, we extend past results to include the possibility of stochastic resetting with, and without, the presence of an absorbing boundary and/or drift. We obtain exact results for the moments and distribution of the local time and these reveal that its statistics usually admits a simple form in the long-time limit. And yet, while fluctuations in the absence of stochastic resetting are typically non-Gaussian—resetting gives rise to Gaussian fluctuations. The analytical findings presented herein are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.",

        "abstract": "First-passage processes can be divided in two classes: those that are accelerated by the introduction of restart and those that display an opposite response. In physical systems, a transition between the two classes may occur as governing parameters are varied to cross a universal tipping point. However, a fully tractable model system to teach us how this transition unfolds is still lacking. To bridge this gap, we quantify the effect of stochastic restart on the first-passage time of a drift-diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. There, we find that the transition is governed by the Péclet number (Pe)—the ratio between the rates of advective and diffusive transport. When Pe  >  1 the process is drift-controlled and restart can only hinder its completion. In contrast, when the process is diffusion-controlled and restart can speed-up its completion by a factor of  ∼1/Pe. Such speedup occurs when the process is restarted at an optimal rate , where stands for the optimal restart rate in the pure-diffusion limit. The transition considered herein stands at the core of restart phenomena and is relevant to a large variety of processes that are driven to completion in the presence of noise. Each of these processes has unique characteristics, but our analysis reveals that the restart transition resembles other phase transitions—some of its central features are completely generic.",

        "abstract": "How position-dependent cell fate acquisition occurs during embryogenesis is a central question in developmental biology. To study this process, we developed a defined, high-throughput assay to induce peri-gastrulation-associated patterning in geometrically confined human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) colonies. We observed that, upon BMP4 treatment, phosphorylated SMAD1 (pSMAD1) activity in the colonies organized into a radial gradient. We developed a reaction-diffusion (RD)-based computational model and observed that the self-organization of pSMAD1 signaling was consistent with the RD principle. Consequent fate acquisition occurred as a function of both pSMAD1 signaling strength and duration of induction, consistent with the positional-information (PI) paradigm. We propose that the self-organized peri-gastrulation-like fate patterning in BMP4-treated geometrically confined hPSC colonies arises via a stepwise model of RD followed by PI. This two-step model predicted experimental responses to perturbations of key parameters such as colony size and BMP4 dose. Furthermore, it also predicted experimental conditions that resulted in RD-like periodic patterning in large hPSC colonies, and rescued peri-gastrulation-like patterning in colony sizes previously thought to be reticent to this behavior. Summary: A high-throughput in vitro system allowing the induction of peri-gastrulation-like fates in geometrically confined hPSC colonies reveals that a two-step process underlies the observed self-organization and subsequent fate acquisition.",

Materials and Methods Institutional review board approval and written informed consent were obtained. Between September 2015 and November 2016, 84 patients (median age, 54 years; range, 29-79 years) with 92 histopathologically confirmed HCCs (40 MVI-positive lesions and 52 MVI-negative lesions) were analyzed. Preoperative MR imaging examinations including diffusion kurtosis imaging (b values: 0, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 sec/mm2) were performed and kurtosis, diffusivity, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were calculated. Morphologic features of conventional MR images were also evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the relative value of these parameters as potential predictors of MVI. Results Features significantly related to MVI of HCC at univariate analysis were increased mean kurtosis value (P < .001), decreased mean diffusivity value (P = .033) and apparent diffusion coefficient value (P = .011), and presence of infiltrative border with irregular shape (P = .005) and irregular circumferential enhancement (P = .026). At multivariate analysis, mean kurtosis value (odds ratio, 6.25; P = .001), as well as irregular circumferential enhancement (odds ratio, 6.92; P = .046), were independent risk factors for MVI of HCC. The mean kurtosis value for MVI of HCC showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.784 (optimal cutoff value was 0.917). Conclusion Higher mean kurtosis values in combination with irregular circumferential enhancement are potential predictive biomarkers for MVI of HCC. © RSNA, 2017.",

        "abstract": "Significance Several active processes operate on eukaryotic genomes, dictating their three-dimensional arrangement and dynamical properties. The combination of structural organization and dynamics is essential to the proper functioning of the cell. We show that an effective energy landscape model for chromatin provides a unifying description of both the structural and dynamical aspects of the genome, recapitulating many of its features. Using this quasi-equilibrium energy landscape model, we demonstrate that the physical interactions accounting for genome architecture also lead to the nontrivial dynamical behavior of genomes previously described in multiple experimental observations. The nucleus of a eukaryotic cell is a nonequilibrium system where chromatin is subjected to active processes that continuously rearrange it over the cell’s life cycle. Tracking the motion of chromosomal loci provides information about the organization of the genome and the physical processes shaping that organization. Optical experiments report that loci move with subdiffusive dynamics and that there is spatially coherent motion of the chromatin. We recently showed that it is possible to predict the 3D architecture of genomes through a physical model for chromosomes that accounts for the biochemical interactions mediated by proteins and regulated by epigenetic markers through a transferable energy landscape. Here, we study the temporal dynamics generated by this quasi-equilibrium energy landscape assuming Langevin dynamics at an effective temperature. Using molecular dynamics simulations of two interacting human chromosomes, we show that the very same interactions that account for genome architecture naturally reproduce the spatial coherence, viscoelasticity, and the subdiffusive behavior of the motion in interphase chromosomes as observed in numerous experiments. The agreement between theory and experiments suggests that even if active processes are involved, an effective quasi-equilibrium landscape model can largely mimic their dynamical effects.",

With power-law fluid grouts as the study object, a cylindrical infiltration diffusion model and spherical infiltration diffusion model are developed by applying the generalized Darcy law and theories of seepage mechanics based on the displacement effect of grout on groundwater. Through examples, the impact of factors including grouting pressure and formation permeability coefficient in the spherical displacement infiltration diffusion model on diffusion radius, flow rate, total pressure of grout in segments, and uniform equivalent pressure in grout diffusion area (grout pressure per unit area in a segment) is analyzed. The result shows that, the diffusion speed, injection flow rate and the pressure received in segments increase with an increase of the grouting pressure. Meanwhile, as the injection time increases, the flow rate of grout under conditions of different grouting pressure all decreases, and a sharp decrease exists. The diffusion speed and grouting pressure are positively correlated to the permeability coefficient, and with the increasement of the injection time, the diffusion displacement of grout in different permeability coefficient varies increasingly, the increase amplitude of the pressure acting on the segment by grout increases gradually.",

        "abstract": "The recent HAWC observations of a very-high-energy γ-ray halo around Geminga and Monogem indicate a very slow diffusion of cosmic rays that results in a tiny contribution of positrons from these two pulsars to the local flux. This makes the cosmic positron excess anomaly observed by PAMELA and AMS-02 even more puzzling. However, from the boron-to-carbon ratio data one can infer that the average diffusion coefficient in the Galaxy should be much larger. In this work we propose a two-zone diffusion model in which the diffusion is slow only in a small region around the source, outside of which the propagation is as fast as usual. We find that this scenario can naturally explain the positron excess data with parameters even more reasonable than those in the conventional one-zone diffusion model. The reason is that during the lifetime of Geminga (∼300 kyr), the electrons/positrons have propagated too far away with a fast diffusion and led to a low local flux. The slow-diffusion region in the two-zone model helps to confine the electrons/positrons for a long time and lead to an enhancement of the local flux. So under the constraint of the HAWC observations, pulsars are still the probable origin of the cosmic-ray positron excess.",

        "abstract": "A fused deposition modeling method was used in this research to investigate the possibility of improving the mechanical properties of poly(lactic acid) by changing the thermal conditions of the printing process. Sample models were prepared while varying a wide range of printing parameters, including bed temperature, melt temperature, and raster angle. Certain samples were also thermally treated by annealing. The prepared materials were subjected to a detailed thermomechanical analysis (differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, heat deflection temperature (HDT)), which allowed the formulation of several conclusions. For all prepared samples, the key changes in mechanical properties are related to the content of the poly(lactic acid) crystalline phase, which led to superior properties in annealed samples. The results also indicate the highly beneficial effect of increased bed temperature, where the best results were obtained for the samples printed at 105 °C. Compared to the reference samples printed at a bed temperature of 60 °C, these samples showed the impact strength increased by 80% (from 35 to 63 J/m), HDT increased by 20 °C (from 55 to 75 °C), and also a significant increase in strength and modulus. Scanning electron microscopy observations confirmed the increased level of diffusion between the individual layers of the printed filament.",

Unfortunately, current battery technologies suffer from a number of challenges, e.g., capacity loss and failure upon prolonged cycling, limited ion diffusion kinetics, and a rather sparse palette of high-performing electrode materials. Here, we discuss the origins of diffusion limitations in oxide materials using V2O5 as a model system. In particular, we discuss constrictions in ionic conduction pathways, narrow energy dispersion of conduction band states, and the stabilization and self-trapping of polarons as local phenomena that have substantial implications for introducing multiscale compositional and phase heterogeneities. Strategies for mitigating such limitations are discussed such as reducing diffusion path lengths and the ...",

        "abstract": "Resource diffusion is a ubiquitous phenomenon, but how it impacts epidemic spreading has received little study. We propose a model that couples epidemic spreading and resource diffusion in multiplex networks. The spread of disease in a physical contact layer and the recovery of the infected nodes are both strongly dependent upon resources supplied by their counterparts in the social layer. The generation and diffusion of resources in the social layer are in turn strongly dependent upon the state of the nodes in the physical contact layer. Resources diffuse preferentially or randomly in this model. To quantify the degree of preferential diffusion, a bias parameter that controls the resource diffusion is proposed. We conduct extensive simulations and find that the preferential resource diffusion can change phase transition type of the fraction of infected nodes. When the degree of interlayer correlation is below a critical value, increasing the bias parameter changes the phase transition from double continuous to single continuous. When the degree of interlayer correlation is above a critical value, the phase transition changes from multiple continuous to first discontinuous and then to hybrid. We find hysteresis loops in the phase transition. We also find that there is an optimal resource strategy at each fixed degree of interlayer correlation under which the threshold reaches a maximum and the disease can be maximally suppressed. In addition, the optimal controlling parameter increases as the degree of inter-layer correlation increases.",

The classical rumor blocking problem aims to launch a set of nodes as a positive cascade to compete with misinformation in order to limit the spread of rumors. However, most of the related researches were based on a one-dimensional diffusion model. In reality, there is more than one feature associated with an object. A user’s impression on this object is determined not just by one feature but by her overall evaluation of all features associated with it. Thus, the influence spread of this object can be decomposed into the spread of multiple features. Based on that, we design a multi-feature diffusion model (MF-model) in this paper and formulate a multi-feature rumor blocking (MFRB) problem on a multi-layer network structure according to this model. To solve the MFRB problem, we design a creative sampling method called Multi-Sampling, which can be applied to this multi-layer network structure. Then, we propose a Revised-IMM algorithm and obtain a satisfactory approximate solution to MFRB. Finally, we evaluate our proposed algorithm by conducting experiments on real datasets, which shows the effectiveness of our Revised-IMM and its advantage to their baseline algorithms.",

        "abstract": "\n The complex pore structure and storage mechanism of organic-rich ultratight reservoirs make the hydrocarbon transport within these reservoirs complicated and significantly different from conventional oil and gas reservoirs. A substantial fraction of pore volume in the ultratight matrix consists of nanopores in which the notion of viscous flow may become irrelevant. Instead, multiple transport and storage mechanisms should be considered to model fluid transport within the shale matrix, including molecular diffusion, Knudsen diffusion, surface diffusion, and sorption. This paper presents a diffusion-based semianalytical model for a single-component gas transport within an infinite-acting organic-rich ultratight matrix. The model treats free and sorbed gas as two phases coexisting in nanopores. The overall mass conservation equation for both phases is transformed into one governing equation solely on the basis of the concentration (density) of the free phase. As a result, the partial differential equation (PDE) governing the overall mass transport carries two newly defined nonlinear terms; namely, effective diffusion coefficient, De, and capacity factor, Φ. The De term accounts for the molecular, Knudsen, and surface diffusion coefficients, and the Φ term considers the mass exchange between free and sorbed phases under sorption equilibrium condition. Furthermore, the ratio of De/Φ is recognized as an apparent diffusion coefficient Da, which is a function of free phase concentration. The nonlinear PDE is solved by applying a piecewise-constant-coefficient technique that divides the domain under consideration into an arbitrary number of subdomains. Each subdomain is assigned with a constant Da. The diffusion-based model is validated against numerical simulation. The model is then used to investigate the impact of surface and Knudsen diffusion coefficients, porosity, and adsorption capacity on gas transport within the ultratight formation. Further, the model is used to study gas transport and production from the Barnett, Marcellus, and New Albany shales. The results show that surface diffusion significantly contributes to gas production in shales with large values of surface diffusion coefficient and adsorption capacity and small values of Knudsen diffusion coefficient and total porosity. Thus, neglecting surface diffusion in organic-rich shales may result in the underestimation of gas production.",

To overcome the difficulties from this kind of delay as well as diffusion effects, a comparison-based approach is applied to this model and a series of algebraic criteria are successfully obtained to verify the global asymptotical synchronization. By specifying the existing delays, some ${M}$ -matrix-based criteria are derived to justify the power-rate synchronization and exponential synchronization. In addition, new criterion on synchronization of general connected neural networks without diffusion effects is also given. Finally, two simulation examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results and provide a comparison with the existing criterion.",

Then, we consider a diffusive predator-prey model with weak Allee effect and delay. Through investigating the dynamics of the corresponding normal form of Turing-Hopf bifurcation induced by diffusion and delay, the spatiotemporal dynamics near this bifurcation point can be divided into six categories. Especially, stable spatially homogeneous/inhomogeneous periodic solutions and steady states, coexistence of two stable spatially inhomogeneous periodic solutions, coexistence of two stable spaially inhomogeneous steady states and the transition from one kind of spatiotemporal patterns to another are found.",

For predator–prey model with modified Leslie–Gower and Holling-type III schemes governed by RD equations, instability induced by time delay can generate spiral waves. Considering that populations are usually organized as networks instead of being continuously distributed in space, it is essential to study the predator–prey model on complex networks. In this paper, we investigate instability induced by time delay for the corresponding network organized system and explore pattern formations on several different networks including deterministic networks and random networks. We firstly obtain instability condition via linear stability analysis and then the condition is applied to study pattern formations for the model in question. The simulation results show that wave patterns can be generated on different networks. However, wave patterns on random networks differ significantly from patterns on deterministic networks. Finally, we discuss the influences of network topology on wave patterns from the aspects of amplitude and period, and reveal the ecology significance implied by these results.",

By varying the voltage in the range from zero to V o c , it is shown that the dependence of diffusion length on the position x in the active layer reduces at higher voltage. The combined influence of applied voltage and temperature on the diffusion length of charge carriers is investigated and it is found that in the low voltage range the diffusion length is temperature independent, but it becomes significantly temperature dependent at higher voltages. Also, it is found that the diffusion length decreases as the applied voltage increases and this reduction becomes much more significant at higher voltage and temperatures. The combined influence of applied voltage and Urbach energy on diffusion length of charge carriers reveals that the diffusion length decreases when both the applied voltage and Urbach energy increase.

In the present study, we applied neural network (NN) potentials, a recently developed machine learning technique, to the study of atom diffusion in amorphous materials, using Li3PO4 as a benchmark material. The NN potential was used together with the nudged elastic band, kinetic Monte Carlo, and molecular dynamics methods to characterize Li vacancy diffusion behavior in the amorphous Li3PO4 model. By comparing these results with corresponding DFT calculations, we found that the average error of the NN potential is 0.048 eV in calculating energy barriers of diffusion paths, and 0.041 eV in diffusion activation energy. Moreover, the diffusion coefficients obtained from molecular dynamics are always consistent with those from ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, while the computation speed of the NN potential is 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than DFT. Lastly, the structure of amorphous Li3PO4 and the ion transport properties in it were studied with the NN potential using a large supercell model containing more than 1000 atoms. The formation of P2O7 units was observed, which is consistent with the experimental characterization. The Li diffusion activation energy was estimated to be 0.55 eV, which agrees well with the experimental measurements.",

We demonstrate the transition between slow and fast H diffusion along the GB with an abrupt change in H diffusivity. Low-angle GBs are shown to comprise isolated high-barrier regions to trap and inhibit H diffusion, with H diffusivity well prescribed by the classical trapping model, while high-angle GBs are shown to provide interconnected low-barrier channels to facilitate H transport. On the basis of the dislocation description of the GB and the Frank-Bilby model, the slow-fast diffusion transition is identified to result from dislocation core overlapping and is accurately predicted.

The simultaneous presence of free saturated fatty acids and polymer‐bound metal carboxylates leads to rapid metal soap crystallization, following a complex mechanism that involves both acid and metal diffusion. Solvent flow, water, and pigments all enhance metal soap crystallization in the model systems.

        "abstract": "In this paper, an antisynchronization problem is considered for an array of linearly coupled reaction–diffusion neural networks with cooperative-competitive interactions and time-varying coupling delays. The interaction topology among the neural nodes is modeled by a multilayer signed graph. The state evolution of a neuron in each layer of the coupled neural network is described by a reaction–diffusion equation (RDE) with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Then, the collective dynamics of the multilayer neural network are modeled by coupled RDEs with both spatial diffusion coupling and state coupling. An edge-based adaptive antisynchronization strategy is proposed for each neural node to achieve antisynchronization by using only local information of neighboring nodes. Furthermore, when the activation functions of the neural nodes are unknown, a linearly parameterized adaptive antisynchronization strategy is also proposed. The convergence of the antisynchronization errors of the nodes is analyzed by using a Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional method and a structural balance condition. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed antisynchronization strategies.",

        "abstract": "\n \n This paper studies the problem of social network embedding without relying on network structures that are usually not observed in many cases. We address that the information diffusion process across networks naturally reflects rich proximity relationships between users. Meanwhile, social networks contain multiple communities regularizing communication pathways for information propagation. Based on the above observations, we propose a probabilistic generative model, called COSINE, to learn community-preserving social network embeddings from the recurrent and time-stamped social contagion logs, namely information diffusion cascades. The learned embeddings therefore capture the high-order user proximities in social networks. Leveraging COSINE, we are able to discover underlying social communities and predict temporal dynamics of social contagion. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the existing approaches.\n \n",

        "abstract": "The year 2019 marks the 60th anniversary of the concept of radial diffusion in magnetospheric research. This makes it one of the oldest research topics in radiation belt science. While first introduced to account for the existence of the Earth’s outer belt, radial diffusion is now applied to the radiation belts of all strongly magnetized planets. But for all its study and application, radial diffusion remains an elusive process. As the theoretical picture evolved over time, so, too, did the definitions of various related concepts, such as the notion of radial transport. Whether data is scarce or not, doubts in the efficacy of the process remain due to the use of various unchecked assumptions. As a result, quantifying radial diffusion still represents a major challenge to tackle in order to advance our understanding of and ability to model radiation belt dynamics. The core objective of this review is to address the confusion that emerges from the coexistence of various definitions of radial diffusion, and to highlight the complexity and subtleties of the problem. To contextualize, we provide a historical perspective on radial diffusion research: why and how the concept of radial diffusion was introduced at Earth, how it evolved, and how it was transposed to the radiation belts of the giant planets. Then, we discuss the necessary theoretical tools to unify the evolving image of radial diffusion, describe radiation belt drift dynamics, and carry out contemporary radial diffusion research.",

        "abstract": "Significance For thousands of years, prehistoric societies built monumental grave architecture and erected standing stones in the coastal regions of Europe (4500–2500 calibrated years BC). Our understanding of the rise of these megalithic societies is contentious and patchy; the origin for the emergence of megalithic architecture in various regions has been controversial and debated for over 100 y. The result presented here, based on analyses of 2,410 radiocarbon dates and highly precise chronologies for megalithic sites and related contexts, suggests maritime mobility and intercultural exchange. We argue for the transfer of the megalithic concept over sea routes emanating from northwest France, and for advanced maritime technology and seafaring in the megalithic Age. There are two competing hypotheses for the origin of megaliths in Europe. The conventional view from the late 19th and early 20th centuries was of a single-source diffusion of megaliths in Europe from the Near East through the Mediterranean and along the Atlantic coast. Following early radiocarbon dating in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis arose of regional independent developments in Europe. This model has dominated megalith research until today. We applied a Bayesian statistical approach to 2,410 currently available radiocarbon results from megalithic, partly premegalithic, and contemporaneous nonmegalithic contexts in Europe to resolve this long-standing debate. The radiocarbon results suggest that megalithic graves emerged within a brief time interval of 200 y to 300 y in the second half of the fifth millennium calibrated years BC in northwest France, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic coast of Iberia. We found decisive support for the spread of megaliths along the sea route in three main phases. Thus, a maritime diffusion model is the most likely explanation of their expansion.",

        "abstract": "Significance The drift-diffusion model (DDM) has been widely used in psychology and neuroeconomics to explain observed patterns of choices and response times. This paper provides an identification and characterization theorems for this model: We show that the parameters are uniquely pinned down and determine which datasets are consistent with some form of DDM. We then develop a statistical test of the model based on finite datasets using spline estimation. These results establish the empirical content of the model and provide a way for researchers to see when it is applicable. The drift-diffusion model (DDM) is a model of sequential sampling with diffusion signals, where the decision maker accumulates evidence until the process hits either an upper or lower stopping boundary and then stops and chooses the alternative that corresponds to that boundary. In perceptual tasks, the drift of the process is related to which choice is objectively correct, whereas in consumption tasks, the drift is related to the relative appeal of the alternatives. The simplest version of the DDM assumes that the stopping boundaries are constant over time. More recently, a number of papers have used nonconstant boundaries to better fit the data. This paper provides a statistical test for DDMs with general, nonconstant boundaries. As a by-product, we show that the drift and the boundary are uniquely identified. We use our condition to nonparametrically estimate the drift and the boundary and construct a test statistic based on finite samples.",

        "title": "Characterization of Prostate Microstructure Using Water Diffusion and NMR Relaxation",
        "abstract": "For many pathologies, early structural tissue changes occur at the cellular level, on the scale of micrometers or tens of micrometers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful non-invasive imaging tool used for medical diagnosis, but its clinical hardware is incapable of reaching the cellular length scale directly. In spite of this limitation, microscopic tissue changes in pathology can potentially be captured indirectly, from macroscopic imaging characteristics, by studying water diffusion. Here we focus on water diffusion and NMR relaxation in the human prostate, a highly heterogeneous organ at the cellular level. We present a physical picture of water diffusion and NMR relaxation in the prostate tissue, that is comprised of a densely-packed cellular compartment (composed of stroma and epithelium), and a luminal compartment with almost unrestricted water diffusion. Transverse NMR relaxation is used to identify fast and slow T 2 components, corresponding to these tissue compartments, and to disentangle the luminal and cellular compartment contributions to the temporal evolution of the overall water diffusion coefficient. Diffusion in the luminal compartment falls into the short-time surface-to-volume (S/V) limit, indicating that only a small fraction of water molecules has time to encounter the luminal walls of healthy tissue; from the S/V ratio, the average lumen diameter averaged over three young healthy subjects is measured to be 217.7±188.7 μm. Conversely, the diffusion in the cellular compartment is highly restricted and anisotropic, consistent with the fibrous character of the stromal tissue. Diffusion transverse to these fibers is well described by the random permeable barrier model (RPBM), as confirmed by the dynamical exponent ϑ = 1/2 for approaching the long-time limit of diffusion, and the corresponding structural exponent p = -1 in histology. The RPBM-derived fiber diameter and membrane permeability were 19.8±8.1 μm and 0.044±0.045 μm/ms, respectively, in agreement with known values from tissue histology and membrane biophysics. Lastly, we revisited 38 prostate cancer cases from a recently published study, and found the same dynamical exponent ϑ = 1/2 of diffusion in tumors and benign regions. Our results suggest that a multi-parametric MRI acquisition combined with biophysical modeling may be a powerful non-invasive complement to prostate cancer grading, potentially foregoing biopsies.",

In epidemic model of infection diseases, positivity is an important property of the continuous system because negative value of a subpopulation is meaningless. The proposed operator splitting NSFD schemes are dynamically consistent with the solution of the continuous model. First scheme is conditionally stable while second operator splitting scheme is unconditionally stable. The stability of the diffusive SEIR model is also verified numerically with the help of Routh-Hurwitz stability condition. Bifurcation value of transmission coefficient is also carried out with and without diffusion. The proposed operator splitting NSFD schemes are compared with the well-known operator splitting finite difference (FD) schemes.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion describes the stochastic motion of particles and is often a key factor in determining the functionality of materials. Modeling diffusion of atoms can be very challenging for heterogeneous systems with high energy barriers. In this report, popular computational methodologies are covered to study diffusion mechanisms that are widely used in the community and both their strengths and weaknesses are presented. In static approaches, such as electronic structure theory, diffusion mechanisms are usually analyzed within the nudged elastic band (NEB) framework on the ground electronic surface usually obtained from a density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Another common approach to study diffusion mechanisms is based on molecular dynamics (MD) where the equations of motion are solved for every time step for all the atoms in the system. Unfortunately, both the static and dynamic approaches have inherent limitations that restrict the classes of diffusive systems that can be efficiently treated. Such limitations could be remedied by exploiting recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. Here, the most promising approaches in this emerging field for modeling diffusion are reported. It is believed that these knowledge‐intensive methods have a bright future ahead for the study of diffusion mechanisms in advanced functional materials.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion MRI may enable non‐invasive mapping of axonal microstructure. Most approaches infer axon diameters from effects of time‐dependent diffusion on the diffusion‐weighted MR signal by modeling axons as straight cylinders. Axons do not, however, propagate in straight trajectories, and so far the impact of the axonal trajectory on diameter estimation has been insufficiently investigated. Here, we employ a toy model of axons, which we refer to as the undulating thin fiber model, to analyze the impact of undulating trajectories on the time dependence of diffusion. We study time‐dependent diffusion in the frequency domain and characterize the diffusion spectrum by its height, width, and low‐frequency behavior (power law exponent). Results show that microscopic orientation dispersion of the thin fibers is the main parameter that determines the characteristics of the diffusion spectra. At lower frequencies (longer diffusion times), straight cylinders and undulating thin fibers can have virtually identical spectra. If the straight‐cylinder assumption is used to interpret data from undulating thin axons, the diameter is overestimated by an amount proportional to the undulation amplitude and microscopic orientation dispersion of the fibers. At higher frequencies (shorter diffusion times), spectra from cylinders and undulating thin fibers differ. The low‐frequency behavior of the spectra from the undulating thin fibers may also differ from that of cylinders, because the power law exponent of undulating fibers can reach values below 2 for experimentally relevant frequency ranges. In conclusion, we argue that the non‐straight nature of axonal trajectories should not be overlooked when analyzing and interpreting diffusion MRI data.",

It combines a dual-process/multi-strategy approach with the standard diffusion model, modeling a utility decision process and a heuristic decision process as diffusion processes of evidence accumulation. For experiments with objective alternatives (including many tasks in judgment and decision making), the model predicts that errors will be quicker than correct responses in case of process conflict and slower in case of alignment, capturing a well-documented asymmetry regarding slow or fast errors. Further, the model also predicts that correct responses are slower in case of conflict than in case of alignment, capturing the well-known Stroop effect. The model is also extended to cover experiments with subjective alternative evaluations, that is, preferential choice. In this case, results depend on whether trials are hard or easy, that is, on whether the heuristic can be interpreted as relatively automatic or not. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Significance When a particle diffuses in a corrugated channel, the channel’s boundaries have a twofold effect of limiting the configuration space accessible to the particle and increasing its hydrodynamic drag. Analytical and numerical approaches well-reproduce the former (entropic) effect, while ignoring the latter (hydrodynamic) effect. Here, we experimentally investigate nonadvective colloidal diffusion in channels with periodically varying width. While validating the current theory for channels much wider than the particle radius, we show that, in narrow channels, hydrodynamic and entropic effects can be equally strong and that hydrodynamic effects can be incorporated into existing descriptions by using an experimentally measured diffusivity. These results significantly advance our understanding of diffusive transport in confined geometries, such as in ionic channels and nanopores. In the absence of advection, confined diffusion characterizes transport in many natural and artificial devices, such as ionic channels, zeolites, and nanopores. While extensive theoretical and numerical studies on this subject have produced many important predictions, experimental verifications of the predictions are rare. Here, we experimentally measure colloidal diffusion times in microchannels with periodically varying width and contrast results with predictions from the Fick–Jacobs theory and Brownian dynamics simulation. While the theory and simulation correctly predict the entropic effect of the varying channel width, they fail to account for hydrodynamic effects, which include both an overall decrease and a spatial variation of diffusivity in channels. Neglecting such hydrodynamic effects, the theory and simulation underestimate the mean and standard deviation of first passage times by 40% in channels with a neck width twice the particle diameter. We further show that the validity of the Fick–Jacobs theory can be restored by reformulating it in terms of the experimentally measured diffusivity. Our work thus shows that hydrodynamic effects play a key role in diffusive transport through narrow channels and should be included in theoretical and numerical models.",

        "abstract": "Brain changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) begin decades before disease diagnosis. While β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are defining features of AD, neuronal loss and synaptic pathology are closely related to the cognitive dysfunction. Brain imaging methods that are tuned to assess degeneration of myelinated nerve fibers in the brain (collectively called white matter) include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and related techniques, and are expected to shed light on disease-related loss of structural connectivity. Participants (N = 70, ages 47–76 years) from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention study underwent DTI and hybrid diffusion imaging to determine a free-water elimination (FWE-DTI) model. The study assessed the extent to which preclinical AD pathology affects brain white matter. Preclinical AD pathology was determined using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The sample was enriched for AD risk (APOE ε4 and parental history of AD). AD pathology assessed by CSF analyses was significantly associated with altered microstructure on both DTI and FWE-DTI. Affected regions included frontal, parietal, and especially temporal white matter. The f-value derived from the FWE-DTI model appeared to be the most sensitive to the relationship between the CSF AD biomarkers and microstructural alterations in white matter. These findings suggest that white matter degeneration is an early pathological feature of AD that may have utility both for early disease detection and as outcome measures for clinical trials. More complex models of microstructural diffusion properties including FWE-DTI may provide increased sensitivity to early brain changes associated with AD over standard DTI.",

        "abstract": "This study proposes a model for self-diffusion coefficients of pure substances from entropy scaling using the perturbed-chain polar statistical associating fluid theory (PCP-SAFT) equation of state. In accordance with the entropy scaling approach proposed by Y. Rosenfeld [Rosenfeld, Y. Phys. Rev. A 1977, 15, 2545–2549], we observe that the self-diffusion coefficient of real substances, once made dimensionless with an appropriate expression, only depends on residual entropy. The proposed model requires 3 parameters for each pure substance. For substances with scarce experimental data, however, a scheme is proposed to estimate one or two of these parameters. We study 133 substances from more than 14 different chemical families and find the average absolute deviation of 8.2% between the proposed model and experimental data (9992 data points). The model shows satisfying robustness for extrapolating self-diffusion coefficients to conditions rather distant from the state points where experimental data are avail...",

However, differences in hydrogel cross-linking density, polymer weight content, and affinity for proteins all contribute to diverse diffusion rates of proteins through hydrogel networks. Here, we describe a simple method to accurately measure protein diffusion through hydrogels, within a few hours and without the use of large amounts of protein. We tracked the diffusion of several proteins of varying molecular weights along the axial direction of capillary tubes filled with alginate, collagen, or poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels. The rate of protein diffusion decreased with increasing molecular weight. A computational model of protein diffusion through capillary tubes was also created to predict and verify experimental protein diffusion coefficients. This in vitro capillary tube-based method of measuring protein diffusion represents a simple strategy to interrogate protein diffusion through natural and synthetic hydrogels and aid in the design of better biomaterial-based delivery vehicles that can effectively modulate protein release.",

For broader applicability, it is necessary to develop techniques that are able to process dynamic or streaming data. Many earlier works on adaptive networks have addressed problems related to this challenge by developing effective strategies that are particularly well-suited to data streaming into graphs. We are thus faced with two paradigms: one where signals are modeled as static and sitting on the graph nodes, and another where signals are modeled as dynamic and streaming into the graph nodes. The objective of this work is to blend these concepts and propose diffusion strategies for adaptively learning from streaming graph signals.",

        "title": "Enhanced Diffusion and Chemotaxis at the Nanoscale.",
        "abstract": "Enzymes have been recently proposed to have mechanical activity associated with their chemical activity. In a number of recent studies, it has been reported that enzymes undergo enhanced diffusion in the presence of their corresponding substrate when this substrate is uniformly distributed in solution. Moreover, if the concentration of the substrate is nonuniform, enzymes and other small molecules have been reported to show chemotaxis (biased stochastic movement in the direction of the substrate gradient), typically toward higher concentrations of this substrate, with a few exceptions. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for enhanced diffusion and chemotaxis at the nanoscale, however, are still not well understood. Understanding these processes is important both for fundamental biological research, for example, in the context of spatial organization of enzymes in metabolic pathways (metabolon formation), as well as for engineering applications, such as in the design of new vehicles for targeted drug delivery. In this Account, we will review the available experimental observations of both enhanced diffusion and chemotaxis, and we will discuss critically the different theories that have been proposed to explain the two. We first focus on enhanced diffusion, beginning with an overview of the experimental results. We then discuss the two main types of mechanisms that have been proposed, namely, active mechanisms relying on the catalytic step of the enzymatic reaction and equilibrium mechanisms, which consider the reversible binding and unbinding of the substrate to the enzyme. We put particular emphasis on an equilibrium model recently introduced by us, which describes how the diffusion of dumbbell-like modular enzymes can be enhanced in the presence of substrate thanks to a binding-induced reduction of the internal fluctuations of the enzyme. We then turn to chemotaxis, beginning with an overview of the experimental evidence for the chemotaxis of enzymes and small molecules, followed by a description of a number of shortcomings and pitfalls in the thermodynamic and phenomenological models for chemotaxis introduced in those and other works in the literature. We then discuss a microscopic model for chemotaxis including both noncontact interactions and specific binding between enzyme and substrate recently developed by us, which overcomes many of these shortcomings and is consistent with the experimental observations of chemotaxis. Finally, we show that the results of this model may be used to engineer chemically active macromolecules that are directed in space via patterning of the concentrations of their substrates.",

In the two-dimensional case, in stark contrast to the classical Keller–Segel model in which large-data solutions may blow up in finite time, for all suitably regular initial data the associated initial value problem is seen to possess a globally-defined bounded classical solution, provided that the motility function ϕ ∈ C3([0,∞)) ∩ W1,∞((0,∞)) is uniformly positive. In the corresponding higher-dimensional setting, it is shown that certain weak solutions exist globally, where in the particular three-dimensional case this solution actually is bounded and classical if the initial data are suitably small in the norm of L2(Ω) × W1,4(Ω). Finally, if still n = 3 but merely the physically interpretable quantity ∥ϕ′∥ L∞((0,∞))∫Ωu0 is appropriately small, then the above-weak solutions are proved to become eventually smooth and bounded.",

Simulations of pure Martini dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers and those with one embedded gramicidin A (gA) dimer or one gA monomer with sizes ranging from 512 to 2048 lipids support the PSD model. Underestimates of D∞ (the value of the diffusion constant for an infinite system) from the 512-lipid system are 35% for DPPC, 45% for the gA monomer, and 70% for the gA dimer. Simulations of all-atom DPPC and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers yield diffusion constants not far from experiment. However, the PSD model predicts that diffusion constants at the sizes of the simulation should underestimate experiment by approximately a factor of 3 for DPPC and 2 for DOPC. This likely implies a deficiency in the C36 force field. A Bayesian method for extrapolating diffusion constants of lipids and proteins in membranes obtained from simulation to infinite system size is provided.",

In 2013, the UK Government set a target for projects timeframes to reduce by 50 per cent. Proposed interventions included more rapid project delivery processes, and consistent improvements to construction delivery predictions, deployed within the framework of 4D Building Information Modelling (BIM). The purpose of this paper is to use Rogers’ Innovation Diffusion theory as a basis to investigate how this adoption has taken place.,In total, 97 construction planning practitioners were surveyed to measure 4D BIM innovation take-up over time. Classic innovation diffusion research methods were adopted.,Results indicated an increasing rate of 4D BIM adoption and reveal a time lag between awareness and first use that is characteristic of this type of innovation.,Use of a non-probability sampling strategy prevents the results being generalisable to the wider construction population. Future research directions and methods are suggested, including qualitative investigations into decision-making processes around 4D BIM, and case studies exploring the consequences of 4D BIM adoption.,Recommendations of how to facilitate the adoption of 4D BIM innovation are proposed, which identify the critical aspects of system compatibility and safe trialling of the innovation.,This paper reinforces 4D BIM as an innovation and records its actual UK industry adoption rate using an accepted diffusion research method. By focusing on UK industry-wide diffusion the work also stands apart from more typical research efforts that limit innovation diffusion exploration to individual organisations.",

The established statistical arbitrage strategy enables us to perform intraday and overnight trading. Essentially, we conduct a three-step calibration procedure to the spreads of all pair combinations in a formation period. Top pairs are selected based on their spreads’ mean-reversion speed and jump behaviour. Afterwards, we trade the top pairs in an out-of-sample trading period with individualized entry and exit thresholds. In the back-testing study, the strategy produces statistically and economically significant returns of 60.61% p.a. and an annualized Sharpe ratio of 5.30, after transaction costs. We benchmark our pairs trading strategy against variants based on traditional distance and time-series approaches and find its performance to be superior relating to risk–return characteristics. The mean-reversion speed is a main driver of successful and fast termination of the pairs trading strategy.",

We perform measurements on the endothermic and relatively slow enzyme aldolase, which also shows substrate-induced enhanced diffusion. We propose a new physical paradigm, which reveals that the diffusion coefficient of a model enzyme hydrodynamically coupled to its environment increases significantly when undergoing changes in conformational fluctuations in a substrate concentration dependent manner, and is independent of the overall turnover rate of the underlying enzymatic reaction. Our results show that substrate-induced enhanced diffusion of enzyme molecules can be explained within an equilibrium picture and that the exothermicity of the catalyzed reaction is not a necessary condition for the observation of this phenomenon.",

In DKI studies, a wide range of different gradient strengths (b‐values) is used, which is known to affect the estimated diffusivity and kurtosis parameters. Hence there is a need to assess the accuracy and precision of the estimated parameters as a function of b‐value. This work examines the error in the estimation of mean of the kurtosis tensor (MKT) with respect to the ground truth, using simulations based on a biophysical model for both gray (GM) and white (WM) matter. Model parameters are derived from densely sampled experimental data acquired in ex vivo rat brain and in vivo human brain. Additionally, the variability of MKT is studied using the experimental data. Prevalent fitting protocols are implemented and investigated. The results show strong dependence on the maximum b‐value of both net relative error and standard deviation of error for all of the employed fitting protocols. The choice of b‐values with minimum MKT estimation error and standard deviation of error was found to depend on the protocol type and the tissue. Protocols that utilize two terms of the cumulant expansion (DKI) were found to achieve minimum error in GM at b‐values less than 1 ms/μm2, whereas maximal b‐values of about 2.5 ms/μm2 were found to be optimal in WM. Protocols including additional higher order terms of the cumulant expansion were found to provide higher accuracy for the more commonly used b‐value regime in GM, but were associated with higher error in WM. Averaged over multiple voxels, a net average error of around 15% for both WM and GM was observed for the optimal b‐value choice. These results suggest caution when using DKI generated metrics for microstructural modeling and when comparing results obtained using different fitting techniques and b‐values.",

We examine both isolated dwarf galaxies and those that are satellites of a Milky Way-mass galaxy. In particular, we study the effects of including a sub-grid turbulent model for the diffusion of metals in gas. Simulations that include diffusion have narrower MDFs and abundance ratio distributions, because diffusion drives individual gas and star particles towards the average metallicity. This effect provides significantly better agreement with observed abundance distributions in dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, including small intrinsic scatter in [α/Fe] versus [Fe/H] of ≲0.1 dex. This small intrinsic scatter arises in our simulations because the interstellar medium in dwarf galaxies is well mixed at nearly all cosmic times, such that stars that form at a given time have similar abundances to ≲0.1 dex. Thus, most of the scatter in abundances at z = 0 arises from redshift evolution and not from instantaneous scatter in the ISM. We find similar MDF widths and intrinsic scatter for satellite and isolated dwarf galaxies, which suggests that environmental effects play a minor role compared with internal chemical evolution in our simulations. Overall, with the inclusion of metal diffusion, our simulations reproduce abundance distribution widths of observed low-mass galaxies, enabling detailed studies of chemical evolution in galaxy formation.",

        "abstract": "In diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), the apparent diffusion coefficient has been recognized as a useful and sensitive surrogate for cell density, paving the way for non-invasive tumor staging, and characterization of treatment efficacy in cancer. However, microstructural parameters, such as cell size, density and/or compartmental diffusivities affect diffusion in various fashions, making of conventional DWI a sensitive but non-specific probe into changes happening at cellular level. Alternatively, tissue complexity can be probed and quantified using the time dependence of diffusion metrics, sometimes also referred to as temporal diffusion spectroscopy when only using oscillating diffusion gradients. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) is emerging as a strong candidate for specific and non-invasive tumor characterization. Despite the lack of a general analytical solution for all diffusion times / frequencies, TDD can be probed in various regimes where systems simplify in order to extract relevant information about tissue microstructure. The fundamentals of TDD are first reviewed (a) in the short time regime, disentangling structural and diffusive tissue properties, and (b) near the tortuosity limit, assuming weakly heterogeneous media near infinitely long diffusion times. Focusing on cell bodies (as opposed to neuronal tracts), a simple but realistic model for intracellular diffusion can offer precious insight on diffusion inside biological systems, at all times. Based on this approach, the main three geometrical models implemented so far (IMPULSED, POMACE, VERDICT) are reviewed. Their suitability to quantify cell size, intra- and extracellular spaces (ICS and ECS) and diffusivities are assessed. The proper modeling of tissue membrane permeability – hardly a newcomer in the field, but lacking applications - and its impact on microstructural estimates are also considered. After discussing general issues with tissue modeling and microstructural parameter estimation (i.e. fitting), potential solutions are detailed. The in vivo applications of this new, non-invasive, specific approach in cancer are reviewed, ranging from the characterization of gliomas in rodent brains and observation of time-dependence in breast tissue lesions and prostate cancer, to the recent preclinical evaluation of new treatments efficacy. It is expected that clinical applications of TDD will strongly benefit the community in terms of non-invasive cancer screening.",

Evidence for this effect anticipation mainly derives from the response-effect (R-E) compatibility (REC) paradigm: In the spatial domain, for example, a left response is produced faster (and sometimes less error-prone) if followed by a compatible left rather than an incompatible right action effect. In the present study, we employed the diffusion model to elucidate the reasons for this observation. To this end, we reanalyzed data from the seminal study by Kunde (2001) and from a new experiment. The overall results suggest that REC affects drift rate. This result fits well with conceptualizing REC as an endogenously created case of stimulus-response compatibility (SRC). Several consequences of this view are discussed against the background of available empirical results.",

The adsorption decay curves were obtained in batch system using different adsorbent dosages. The PVDM model did not interpreted the kinetic adsorption since the calculated value of Dp equal to 5.64 × 10−7 cm2 s−1 predicted a slower adsorption than that obtained by the experimental data. The PVSDM results indicates that the intraparticle diffusion is predominantly due to surface diffusion (93%) and the pore volume diffusion can be negligible. Once the surface diffusion was the limiting step, the estimation with one (Ds) and two (Dsq and α) parameters were tested in the SDM model. The statistical analysis revealed that the one-parameter SDM model was most appropriate to predict the CV adsorption on bentonite. The optimal values of Ds ranged from 6.19 × 10−10 to 6.49 × 10−10 cm2 s−1, and decrease with the adsorbent dosage.",

In this study, we report how dislocations affect oxygen ion diffusion in Sr-doped LaMnO3 (LSM), a model perovskite oxide that serves in energy conversion technologies. LSM epitaxial thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to more than 100 nm were prepared by pulsed laser deposition on single-crystal LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 substrates. The lattice mismatch between the film and substrates induces compressive or tensile in-plane strain in the LSM layers. This lattice strain is partially reduced by dislocations, especially in the LSM films on LaAlO3. Oxygen isotope exchange measured by secondary ion mass spectrometry revealed the existence of at least two very different diffusion coefficients in the LSM films on LaAlO3. The diffusion profiles can be quantitatively explained by the existence of fast oxygen ion diffusion along threading dislocations that is faster by up to 3 orders of magnitude compared to that in LSM bulk.",

However, it indeed may arise in the case when the diffusion (as described in Ito interpretation) is observed under equilibrated conditions. This paradigmatic situation can be translated into the model of the diffusion coefficient fluctuating in time along a trajectory, i.e. into a kind of the ‘diffusing diffusivity’ model.",

Similar behavior has also been observed in granular materials, turbulent flows, gels and colloidal suspensions, suggesting that this is a general feature of diffusion in complex media. A possible interpretation of this phenomenon is that a tracer explores a medium with spatio-temporal fluctuations which result in local changes of diffusivity. We propose and investigate an ergodic, easily interpretable model, which implements the concept of diffusing diffusivity. Depending on the parameters, the distribution of displacements can be either flat or peaked at small displacements with an exponential tail at large displacements. We show that the distribution converges slowly to a Gaussian one. We calculate statistical properties, derive the asymptotic behavior and discuss some implications and extensions.",

Here, we extend the study of citation dynamics to a more general diffusion process to understand how citation growth associates with different diffusion patterns. Using a classic diffusion model, we quantify and illustrate specific diffusion mechanisms which have been proven to exert a significant impact on the growth and decay of citation counts. Experiments reveal a positive relation between the “low p and low q” pattern and high scientific impact. A sharp citation peak produced by rapid change of citation counts, however, has a negative effect on future impact. In addition, we have suggested a simple indicator, saturation level, to roughly estimate an individual article's current stage in the life cycle and its potential to attract future attention.

The method has the advantage that it does not require sealing of the samples edges because 3-D anisotropic diffusion theory is implemented for obtaining the diffusion constants. A microscale model is presented, where matrix and fiber bundles are modeled separately. The matrix properties have been obtained experimentally and the fiber bundle properties have been deduced by the composite homogenized diffusivity model.

These properties include contagious, hierarchical, and relocation diffusion. Each of these refers to a spatial model that epitomizes how innovations spread among geographic locations. Policy diffusion, a separate but homologous research tradition, had its theoretical underpinnings in spatial diffusion. However, contemporary policy diffusion has focused largely on mechanism-based diffusion. This article demonstrates how exploratory spatial data analysis can be used to uncover spatial policy diffusion properties. In this study, municipal smoking regulation adoptions, religious-based initiatives, and bag ban and bag fees are examined. This study finds evidence that for each policy more than one property is occurring; therefore, this study proposes that a hybrid model best explains diffusion. This article demonstrates how examining spatial diffusion properties, in addition to diffusion mechanisms, can improve the conceptualization of diffusion theories, enhance mechanism or theory-based specification of diffusion models, and unravel the specific regional or neighboring causal pathways linking policies between adopting jurisdictions.",

The proposed ANN approach was compared with conventional least‐squares regression (LSR) and state‐of‐the‐art multi‐step fitting (LSR‐MS) in Monte‐Carlo simulations and in vivo in terms of estimation accuracy and precision, number of outliers and sensitivity in the distinction between grey (GM) and white (WM) matter. Both the proposed ANN approach and LSR‐MS yielded visually increased parameter map quality. Estimations of all parameters (perfusion fraction f, diffusion coefficient D, pseudo‐diffusion coefficient D*, kurtosis K) were in good agreement with the literature using ANN, whereas LSR‐MS resulted in D* overestimation and LSR yielded increased values for f and D*, as well as decreased values for K. Using ANN, outliers were reduced for the parameters f (ANN, 1%; LSR‐MS, 19%; LSR, 8%), D* (ANN, 21%; LSR‐MS, 25%; LSR, 23%) and K (ANN, 0%; LSR‐MS, 0%; LSR, 15%). Moreover, ANN enabled significant distinction between GM and WM based on all parameters, whereas LSR facilitated this distinction only based on D and LSR‐MS on f, D and K. Overall, the proposed ANN approach was found to be superior to conventional LSR, posing a powerful alternative to the state‐of‐the‐art method LSR‐MS with several advantages in the estimation of IVIM–kurtosis parameters, which might facilitate increased applicability of enhanced diffusion models at clinical scan times.",

        "abstract": "The lateral diffusion of embedded proteins along lipid membranes in protein-poor conditions has been successfully described in terms of the Saffman-Delbrück (SD) model, which predicts that the protein diffusion coefficient D is weakly dependent on its radius R as D ∝ ln(1/R). However, instead of being protein-poor, native cell membranes are extremely crowded with proteins. On the basis of extensive molecular simulations, we here demonstrate that protein crowding of the membrane at physiological levels leads to deviations from the SD relation and to the emergence of a stronger Stokes-like dependence D ∝ 1/R. We propose that this 1/R law mainly arises due to geometrical factors: smaller proteins are able to avoid confinement effects much better than their larger counterparts. The results highlight that the lateral dynamics in the crowded setting found in native membranes is radically different from protein-poor conditions and plays a significant role in formation of functional multiprotein complexes.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Social media platforms disseminate a massive volume of user-generated content, some of which convey similar and overlapping information. We study how the diffusion of a given piece of content (called a cascade) is influenced by the diffusion of other cascades carrying similar content (called parallel cascades). We theorize that the diffusion of a cascade can be inhibited or amplified by that of parallel cascades containing similar content. To study this phenomenon, we formulate a generalized version of the self-exciting point process model and showcase a novel approach to evaluating the parallel diffusion of similar social media content. We estimate the model using Twitter data. We observe that, on average, the diffusion of a cascade is inhibited by the concurrent diffusion of parallel cascades with similar content. We further identify an asymmetry among content producers as the diffusion of content contributed by those with larger networks is more likely to be amplified by the diffusion of similar content. Our study underscores the importance of accounting for content similarity as failing to do so may overestimate assessments of a cascade’s diffusion. Our results also suggest that smaller, individual social media content contributors should avoid publishing repetitive content and channel their efforts towards developing novel content, while this is not a concern for larger content contributors.",

Given the interaction among multiple messages involved in a diffusion process and the rich intertwined effects, a diffusion model based on multiple messages and multiplex network space is proposed. The proposed model attempts to explore the internal mechanism related to concurrent diffusion of multiple messages relative to social topics. First, aiming at the multidimensional characteristics of the diffusion space, the overlap of social structure, and the complexity of diffusion behavior are mined and mapped to a multiplex diffusion space. Through hierarchical processing, multidimensional message diffusion paths can be constructed, and the diffusion situation of each message can be further perceived. In addition, because, in information diffusion, the infectious rate depends on the time change, the time-dependent variables associated with interaction among multiple messages are introduced. In this manner, the diffusion process of mutual promotion (cooperative relationship) and restraint (competitive relationship) between multiple messages can be revealed. Finally, considering information interaction and diffusion network complexity, a dynamic interaction mechanism based on the multiplex SIS diffusion model is introduced. A unified framework of multiple messages coupled dynamic processes is constructed using a discrete-time microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA). Experimental results indicate that the framework can reveal the mechanism of multiple message interaction in social topics more realistically.",

        "abstract": "The increasing popularization of large-scale online social networks (OSNs) facilitates information sharing. Users are able to diffuse positive and negative information independently owing to the high openness of the OSNs. Due to the intervention of user’s emotions and social relationships, the positive and negative information diffusion exhibits a complicated dynamic coupling diffusion process, in which the negative information diffusion can cause social panic and confusion. However, prior works mainly focus on the diffusion of single type of information. To fill this gap, this paper aims to investigate the dynamic diffusion process of the positive and negative information and control the negative information diffusion timely. Specifically, we first establish a coupling diffusion model to characterize the dynamic diffusion process under the coexistence of positive and negative information, then derive the critical condition for the negative information diffusion and certify the stability of the diffusion model. Furthermore, we propose two collaborative control strategies to persuade and guide users to diffuse the positive information simultaneously. Then, the issue of minimizing the total system costs is transformed to an optimal control problem. Finally, we prove the existence and uniqueness of optimal control solutions and obtain the dynamic distribution of optimal control strategies over time to minimize system costs. The experimental results obtained from two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our model and the high efficiency of the collaborative control strategies.",

The apparent diffusion coefficient is different from the true diffusion coefficient, which would result in the deviation of methane production. In this study, the particle method using the unipore model and the counterdiffusion method is adopted to measure the methane diffusion coefficients. The results indicated that the true diffusion coefficient obtained by the counterdiffusion experiment decreases first and then increases with increasing methane pressure. The apparent diffusion coefficients obtained by the particle method with two different grain sizes are lower than the true diffusion coefficient. The relationship between the apparent diffusion coefficient and the true diffusion coefficient is analyzed, and the desorption capacity factor (DCF) is proposed to reflect the gap between them. The apparent diffusion coefficient is closer to the true diffusion coefficient when the DCF is small. ...",

        "abstract": "In the restoration of paintings, solvent diffusion and swelling of polymeric oil paint binding media are important factors to consider. Common cleaning methods with organic solvents or aqueous solutions could lead to undesirable physicochemical changes in the paint in the long term, though the extent of this effect is not yet clear. We used tailored nonporous model systems for aged oil paint to measure paint swelling and solvent diffusion for a wide range of relevant solvents. Using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), the glass transition temperature of our model systems was found to be close to room temperature. Subsequently, with a custom sample cell and time-dependent attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, we were able to accurately track swelling and diffusion processes in the polymer films. To quantify the spectroscopic data, we developed a model that completely describes the solvent migration process, including significant film swelling and non-Fickian solvent diffusion. The relation between solvent properties, the diffusion coefficient, and the swelling capacity proved to be rather complex and could not be explained using a single solvent parameter. However, it was found that strongly swelling solvents generally diffuse faster than weakly swelling solvents and that pigmentation does not significantly influence solvent diffusion. These results contribute to a better understanding of transport phenomena in paintings and support the development of improved paint restoration strategies.",

Comparisons are made using flame speeds, surface areas, species profiles, and chemical source terms. Once validated, this model is applied to three-dimensional laminar and turbulent flames. For these cases, thermal diffusion causes an increase in the propagation speed of the flames as well as increased product chemical source terms in regions of high positive curvature.

Solute diffusion in compacted clays depends on ionic strength through its control on the thickness of the electrical double layer (EDL) on the charged clay surfaces. In the DR-A field experiment (Mont Terri, Switzerland), synthetic porewater was circulated through a borehole for 189 days, leading to the out-diffusion of a variety of tracers into the Opalinus Clay. The borehole solution was then replaced with a higher-salinity solution for an additional 540 days, leading to the diffusion of Cs+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+ back into the borehole and to an increase in the out-diffusion of anions (I-, Br-) and 3H. The experimental results were interpreted using the CrunchClay code, which includes a mean electrostatic potential model for the EDL. The EDL corresponds to a second continuum in addition to bulk electrically neutral porewater. Species-specific diffusion (Nernst-Planck equation) occurs through both domains. A 1D radial model considered a single pore diffusion coefficient (Dp = 10-9 m2/s) for cations and 3H in the bulk porosity, and a smaller Dp (3 × 10-10 m2/s) for anions. Dp values in the EDL were smaller (10-11 m2/s), except for Cs+ and K+ (5 × 10-10 and 2 × 10-10 m2/s, respectively). The model reproduced well the experimental results and showed the capability to consider temporal changes in geochemical conditions affecting the transport and retention of potentially important radionuclide contaminants (e.g., 137Cs+, 90Sr2+, 129I-) in underground geological nuclear waste repositories. Coupled multicomponent diffusion together with the electrostatic properties of the charged surfaces are essential in the development of predictive models for ion transport in clays.",

        "abstract": "The processes responsible for the effective longitudinal transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) are still not completely understood. We address this issue by simulating SEP electron propagation using a spatially 2D transport model that includes perpendicular diffusion. By implementing, as far as possible, the most reasonable estimates of the transport (diffusion) coefficients, we compare our results, in a qualitative manner, to recent observations at energies of 55–105 keV, focusing on the longitudinal distribution of the peak intensity, the maximum anisotropy, and the onset time. By using transport coefficients that are derived from first principles, we limit the number of free parameters in the model to (i) the probability of SEPs following diffusing magnetic field lines, quantified by , and (ii) the broadness of the Gaussian injection function. It is found that the model solutions are extremely sensitive to the magnitude of the perpendicular diffusion coefficient and relatively insensitive to the form of the injection function as long as a reasonable value of a = 0.2 is used. We illustrate the effects of perpendicular diffusion on the model solutions and discuss the viability of this process as a dominant mechanism by which SEPs are transported in longitude. Lastly, we try to quantity the effectiveness of perpendicular diffusion as an interplay between the magnitude of the relevant diffusion coefficient and the SEP intensity gradient driving the diffusion process. It follows that perpendicular diffusion is extremely effective early in an SEP event when large intensity gradients are present, while the effectiveness quickly decreases with time thereafter.",

        "abstract": "Objective Prior studies in prostate diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have largely explored the impact of b-value and diffusion directions on estimated diffusion coefficient D. Here we suggest varying diffusion time, t, to study time-dependent D(t) in prostate cancer, thereby adding an extra dimension in the development of prostate cancer biomarkers. Methods Thirty-eight patients with peripheral zone prostate cancer underwent 3-T MRI using an external-array coil and a diffusion-weighted image sequence acquired for b = 0, as well as along 12 noncollinear gradient directions for b = 500 s/mm2 using stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). For this sequence, 6 diffusion times ranging from 20.8 to 350 milliseconds were acquired. Tumors were classified as low-grade (Gleason score [GS] 3 + 3; n = 11), intermediate-grade (GS 3 + 4; n = 16), and high-grade (GS ≥4 + 3; n = 11). Benign peripheral zone and transition zone were also studied. Results Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) D(t) decreased with increasing t in all zones of the prostate, though the rate of decay in D(t) was different between sampled zones. Analysis of variance and area under the curve analyses suggested better differentiation of tumor grades at shorter t. Fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with t for all regions of interest. On average, highest FA was observed within GS 3 + 3 tumors. Conclusions There is a measurable time dependence of ADC in prostate cancer, which is dependent on the underlying tissue and Gleason score. Therefore, there may be an optimal selection of t for prediction of tumor grade using ADC. Controlling t should allow ADC to achieve greater reproducibility between different sites and vendors. Intentionally varying t enables targeted exploration of D(t), a previously overlooked biophysical phenomenon in the prostate. Its further microstructural understanding and modeling may lead to novel diffusion-derived biomarkers.",

However, due to their low concentration (∼1%), the effect of antisite defects on Li diffusion has only been systematically investigated by theoretical approaches. In this work, the exchange between Li in solid LiFePO4 (92.5% enriched with 6Li) and Li in the liquid Li electrolyte solution (containing natural abundance Li, 7.6% 6Li and 92.4% 7Li) was measured as a function of time by both ex situ and in situ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. The experimental data reveal that the time dependence of the isotope exchange cannot be modeled by a simple single-file diffusion process and that defects must play a role in the mobility of ions in the LiFePO4 particles. By performing kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that explicitly consider antisite defects, which allow Li to cross over between adjacent channels, we show that the observed tracer exchange behavio...",

        "abstract": "A Bayesian-based methodology is developed to estimate diffusion tensors from molecular dynamics simulations of permeants in anisotropic media, and is applied to oxygen in lipid bilayers. By a separation of variables in the Smoluchowski diffusion equation, the multidimensional diffusion is reduced to coupled one-dimensional diffusion problems that are treated by discretization. The resulting diffusivity profiles characterize the membrane transport dynamics as a function of the position across the membrane, discriminating between diffusion normal and parallel to the membrane. The methodology is first validated with neat water, neat hexadecane, and a hexadecane slab surrounded by water, the latter being a simple model for a lipid membrane. Next, a bilayer consisting of pure 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and a bilayer mimicking the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane, including cardiolipin, are investigated. We analyze the detailed time evolution of oxygen molecules, in terms of both normal diffusion through and radial diffusion inside the membrane. Diffusion is fast in the more loosely packed interleaflet region, and anisotropic, with oxygen spreading more rapidly in the membrane plane than normal to it. Visualization of the propagator shows that oxygen enters the membrane rapidly, reaching its thermodynamically favored center in about 1 ns, despite the free energy barrier at the headgroup region. Oxygen transport is quantified by computing the oxygen permeability of the membranes and the average radial diffusivity, which confirm the anisotropy of the diffusion. The position-dependent diffusion constants and free energies are used to construct compartmental models and test assumptions used in estimating permeability, including Overton's rule. In particular, a hexadecane slab surrounded by water is found to be a poor model of oxygen transport in membranes because the relevant energy barriers differ substantially.",

        "abstract": "Purpose To correlate quantitative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) parameters derived from conventional monoexponential DWI, stretched exponential DWI, diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) with quantitative histopathologic tumor tissue composition in prostate cancer in a preliminary hypothesis-generating study. Materials and Methods This retrospective institutional review board-approved study included 24 patients with prostate cancer (mean age, 63 years) who underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including high-b-value DWI and DTI at 3.0 T, before prostatectomy. The following parameters were calculated in index tumors and nontumoral peripheral zone (PZ): apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) obtained with monoexponential fit (ADCME), ADC obtained with stretched exponential modeling (ADCSE), anomalous exponent (α) obtained at stretched exponential DWI, ADC obtained with DKI modeling (ADCDKI), kurtosis with DKI, ADC obtained with DTI (ADCDTI), and fractional anisotropy (FA) at DTI. Parameters in prostate cancer and PZ were compared by using paired Student t tests. Pearson correlations between tumor DWI and quantitative histologic parameters (nuclear, cytoplasmic, cellular, stromal, luminal fractions) were determined. Results All DWI parameters were significantly different between prostate cancer and PZ (P < .012). ADCME, ADCSE, and ADCDKI all showed significant negative correlation with cytoplasmic and cellular fractions (r = -0.546 to -0.435; P < .034) and positive correlation with stromal fractions (r = 0.619-0.669; P < .001). ADCDTI and FA showed correlation only with stromal fraction (r = 0.512 and -0.413, respectively; P < .045). α did not correlate with histologic parameters, whereas kurtosis showed significant correlations with histopathologic parameters (r = 0.487, 0.485, -0.422 for cytoplasmic, cellular, and stromal fractions, respectively; P < .040). Conclusion Advanced DWI methods showed significant correlations with histopathologic tissue composition in prostate cancer. These findings should be validated in a larger study. © RSNA, 2017 Online supplemental material is available for this article. An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

        "abstract": "Computational methods have been extensively used to understand the underlying dynamics of molecular communication methods employed by nature. One very effective and popular approach is to utilize a Monte Carlo simulation. Although it is very reliable, this method can have a very high computational cost, which in some cases renders the simulation impractical. Therefore, in this paper, for the special case of an excitatory synaptic molecular communication channel, we present a novel mathematical model for the diffusion and binding of neurotransmitters that takes into account the effects of synaptic geometry in 3-D space and re-absorption of neurotransmitters by the transmitting neuron. Based on this model we develop a fast deterministic algorithm, which calculates expected value of the output of this channel, namely, the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), for given synaptic parameters. We validate our algorithm by a Monte Carlo simulation, which shows total agreement between the results of the two methods. Finally, we utilize our model to quantify the effects of variation in synaptic parameters, such as position of release site, receptor density, size of postsynaptic density, diffusion coefficient, uptake probability, and number of neurotransmitters in a vesicle, on maximum number of bound receptors that directly affect the peak amplitude of EPSP.",

This paper presents a numerical study on the chloride diffusion mechanism within RAC. Considering the random distribution of recycled coarse aggregates (RCA), a five-phase RAC model – including new mortar, adherent old mortar, new interfacial transition zone (ITZ), old ITZ and original natural coarse aggregates – is proposed to predict the effective diffusion coefficient of chlorides in RAC. The parametric studies, based on a series of critical factors (i.e. volume fraction of RCA, adhesive ratio of old mortar, chloride diffusivity of adherent old mortar, thicknesses of old and new ITZs and chloride diffusivity of old and new ITZs), reveal the properties of each phase and their individual impact on the effective diffusion coefficient of chlorides in RAC. The results obtained indicate that, interestingly, the effectiv...",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In almost all low-income countries, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a primary engine for the country’s economic development. While many information and communications technology (ICT) diffusion studies exist, only few focus on low-income countries and even fewer employ Bass-based analysis to examine ICT diffusion in these countries. This study applies the Bass diffusion model to understand SME adoption of ICT in Cameroon, a low-income country. The Bass model was employed because of its predictive capacity. We find that diffusion of ICT among SMEs in the context of a low-income economy is largely driven by forces of imitation rather than forces of innovation. Contributing to practice, this study finds that SMEs with greater sizes, multiple plants, and whose owners have higher education have a greater tendency to adopt ICT early. The theoretical contribution of the paper is applying the well-recognized Bass model from marketing to the IT/IS field and applying it within a low-income country environment by evaluating diffusion of ICTs among SMEs in Cameroon.",

        "abstract": "We present an analytical diffusion–expansion Forbush decrease (FD) model ForbMod, which is based on the widely used approach of an initially empty, closed magnetic structure (i.e., flux rope) that fills up slowly with particles by perpendicular diffusion. The model is restricted to explaining only the depression caused by the magnetic structure of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We use remote CME observations and a 3D reconstruction method (the graduated cylindrical shell method) to constrain initial boundary conditions of the FD model and take into account CME evolutionary properties by incorporating flux rope expansion. Several flux rope expansion modes are considered, which can lead to different FD characteristics. In general, the model is qualitatively in agreement with observations, whereas quantitative agreement depends on the diffusion coefficient and the expansion properties (interplay of the diffusion and expansion). A case study was performed to explain the FD observed on 2014 May 30. The observed FD was fitted quite well by ForbMod for all expansion modes using only the diffusion coefficient as a free parameter, where the diffusion parameter was found to correspond to an expected range of values. Our study shows that, in general, the model is able to explain the global properties of an FD caused by a flux rope and can thus be used to help understand the underlying physics in case studies.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Two-alternative forced-choice tasks are widely used to gain insight into specific areas of enhancement or impairment in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Data arising from these tasks have been used to support myriad theories regarding the integrity, or otherwise, of particular brain areas or cognitive processes in ASD. The drift diffusion model (DDM) provides an account of the underlying processes which give rise to accuracy and reaction time (RT) distributions, and parameterizes these processes in terms which have direct psychological interpretation. Importantly, the DDM provides further insight into the origin of potential group differences in task performance. Here, for the first time, we used the DDM to investigate perceptual decision making in ASD. Method: Adults with (N = 25) and without ASD (N = 32) performed an orientation discrimination task. A drift diffusion model was applied to the full RT distributions. Results: Participants with ASD responded more slowly than controls, the groups did not differ in accuracy. Modeled parameters indicated that: (a) participants with ASD were more cautious than controls (wider boundary separation); (b) nondecision time was increased in ASD; and (c) the quality of evidence extracted from the stimulus (drift rate) did not vary between groups. Conclusions: Taking the behavioral data in isolation would suggest reduced perceptual sensitivity in ASD. However, DDM results indicated that despite response slowing, there was no evidence of differential perceptual sensitivity between participants with and without ASD. Future use of the DDM in investigations of perception and cognition in ASD is highly recommended.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we detect communities from trajectories. Existing algorithms for trajectory clustering usually rely on simplex representation and a single proximity-related metric. Unfortunately, additional information markers (e.g., social interactions or semantics in the spatial layout) are ignored, leading to the inability to fully discover the communities in trajectory database. This is especially true for human-generated trajectories, where additional fine-grained markers (e.g., movement velocity at certain locations, or the sequence of semantic spaces visited) are especially useful in capturing latent relationships among community members. To overcome this limitation, we propose TODMIS, a general framework for Trajectory-based cOmmunity Detection by diffusion modeling on Multiple Information Sources. TODMIS combines additional information with raw trajectory data and construct the diffusion process on multiple similarity metrics. It also learns the consistent graph Laplacians by constructing the multi-modal diffusion process and optimizing the heat kernel coupling on each pair of similarity matrices from multiple information sources. Then, dense sub-graph detection is used to discover the set of distinct communities (including community size) on the coupled multi-graph representation. At last, based on the community information, we propose a novel model for online recommendation. We evaluate TODMIS and our online recommendation methods using different real-life datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.",

A reduction in trade costs induces a re-allocation of comparative advantage in production and innovation across sectors, which translates into higher growth along the counterfactual balanced growth path (BGP). Heterogeneous knowledge diffusion across country-sectors amplifies the specialization effects of trade-induced R&D re-allocation, becoming an additional source of growth and welfare.",

Using the “1 + M + N” complex network model with BA scale-free characteristics, this paper studies the credit risk diffusion in a supply chain finance network, where the credit risk diffusion process is simulated by the SIS epidemic model. We examine the impacts of various key factors, including the general financing ratio, cure time, network structure, and network scale on the credit risk diffusion process. It is found that credit risk diffusion rarely occurs in a network with a low average degree. When the average degree of the network increases, the occurrence of the credit risk diffusion becomes more frequent. Besides, the degree of the initially infected nodes with credit risk does not affect the density of the infected nodes in the steady state, while a higher degree of the cure nodes helps restrain the diffusion of credit risk in the supply chain finance network. Finally, the simulation result based on the supply chain finance network with a core node indicates that the diffusion of the credit risk diffusion in sparse supply chain finance networks with low average degrees is unstable. The results provide better understandings on the credit risk diffusion in supply chain finance networks.",

        "abstract": "Water diffusion into composites in different directions was examined in this study with the aim of determining the best way of measuring diffusion coefficients and to provide values to compare with model predictions. Water absorption behavior of unreinforced epoxy resins and carbon fiber reinforced epoxy composite materials was investigated with long-term exposure to different environmental conditions. Initial Fickian absorption was observed followed by a slower second stage that continues for at least 3.7 years. Fiber architecture was found to be an important aspect of controlling absorption, where water diffusion along fibers was observed to be about three times faster than across the fibers and about seven times faster than through the thickness. A three-dimensional finite element computer model based on Fickian diffusion behavior was developed to predict the levels of moisture absorption under hot/humid environments. A multi-scale modeling approach was used which allowed the results of simulations at the micro-structural level to be used to predict the diffusivity in different directions. The modeled diffusion coefficients showed high dependency on the detailed micro-structure. Experimental results provided a baseline for the validation of the model, and it was found that these data could be closely predicted using a reasonable micro-structure characterization. POLYM.

Contrary to the existing works in literature, which define the informed Twitter users as those who have produced/reproduced tweets with a specific hashtag, our model considers as informed a superset of Twitter users who have seen/produced/reproduced tweets with a specific hashtag. Thus, it does not underestimate the extent of information propagation in the network.

In order to analyze the role of opinion leader in OSN and the life cycle of Sina Microblog information diffusion, the public emergency information diffusion model and a new method grading opinion leader model are proposed. Firstly, the people of OSN are divided into three kinds: supporter, neutral, and objector. Information interaction formula of opinion leader is built up according to the properties of all kinds of subjects (public people, rumor maker, and opinion leader), and the statistical analysis of the microblog information data is obtained by the computer technology. Second, the communication power is constructed as a function related to the three factors (the number of forwarding, the degree of activity, and the number of fans), and then a weight calculation method based on the analytic hierarchy process is established. Communication power is combined with the new proposed model, and the information diffusion of opinion leader and microblog life cycle is researched. The simulation results show that the established public emergency information diffusion model can truly reflect the actual situation. Opinion leaders have a strong communication in microblog information diffusion. Opinion leaders can influence those who are unsteady about certain public emergency. The value of error is 13.7% and 5.1% by comparing the true data. It is proved that the new proposed models are reasonable and effective for the communication life of the analysis opinion leader in microblog information diffusion.",

In this paper, we propose a multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for the mass diffusion in multicomponent mixtures and also perform a Chapman-Enskog analysis to show that the MS continuum equations can be correctly recovered from the developed LB model. In addition, considering the fact that the MS-theory-based diffusion equations are just a diffusion type of partial differential equations, we can also adopt much simpler lattice structures to reduce the computational cost of present LB model. We then conduct some simulations to test this model and find that the results are in good agreement with the previous work. Besides, the reverse diffusion, osmotic diffusion, and diffusion barrier phenomena are also captured. Finally, compared to the kinetic-theory-based LB models for multicomponent gas diffusion, the present model does not include any complicated interpolations, and its collision process can still be implemented locally. Therefore, the advantages of single-component LB method can also be preserved in present LB model.",

To model this process, we develop a mathematical description for the nonequilibrium binary permeation of guest molecules during gas replacement based on the microscopic “hole-in-cage-wall” diffusive mechanism. The transport of gas molecules is envisaged as a series of jumps between occupied and empty neighboring cages without any significant lattice restructuring in the bulk. The gas exchange itself is seen as two-stage swapping initiated by almost instantaneous formation of a mixed hydrate layer on the hydrate surface followed by a much slower permeation-controlled process. The model is constrained by and validated with available time-resolved neutron diffraction data of the isostructural CH4 guest replacement by CO2 in methane hydrate, a process of possible importance for the sequestration of CO2 with concomitant recovery of CH4 in marine gas hydrates.",

        "abstract": "Expanding media are typical in many different fields, e.g., in biology and cosmology. In general, a medium expansion (contraction) brings about dramatic changes in the behavior of diffusive transport properties such as the set of positional moments and the Green's function. Here, we focus on the characterization of such effects when the diffusion process is described by the continuous-time random-walk (CTRW) model. As is well known, when the medium is static this model yields anomalous diffusion for a proper choice of the probability density function (pdf) for the jump length and the waiting time, but the behavior may change drastically if a medium expansion is superimposed on the intrinsic random motion of the diffusing particle. For the case where the jump length and the waiting time pdfs are long-tailed, we derive a general bifractional diffusion equation which reduces to a normal diffusion equation in the appropriate limit. We then study some particular cases of interest, including Lévy flights and subdiffusive CTRWs. In the former case, we find an analytical exact solution for the Green's function (propagator). When the expansion is sufficiently fast, the contribution of the diffusive transport becomes irrelevant at long times and the propagator tends to a stationary profile in the comoving reference frame. In contrast, for a contracting medium a competition between the spreading effect of diffusion and the concentrating effect of contraction arises. In the specific case of a subdiffusive CTRW in an exponentially contracting medium, the latter effect prevails for sufficiently long times, and all the particles are eventually localized at a single point in physical space. This \"big crunch\" effect, totally absent in the case of normal diffusion, stems from inefficient particle spreading due to subdiffusion. We also derive a hierarchy of differential equations for the moments of the transport process described by the subdiffusive CTRW model in an expanding medium. From this hierarchy, the full time evolution of the second-order moment is obtained for some specific types of expansion. In the case of an exponential expansion, exact recurrence relations for the Laplace-transformed moments are obtained, whence the long-time behavior of moments of arbitrary order is subsequently inferred. Our analytical and numerical results for both Lévy flights and subdiffusive CTRWs confirm the intuitive expectation that the medium expansion hinders the mixing of diffusive particles occupying separate regions. In the case of Lévy flights, we quantify this effect by means of the so-called \"Lévy horizon.\"",

By calculating surface diffusion coefficients based on the Einstein equation, we exactly demonstrate that the gas diffusion on a graphene surface is a two-dimensional gas behavior mainly controlled by the collisions between adsorbed molecules. The surface diffusion on the graphene film just follows the bulk diffusion qualitatively, namely the diffusion coefficients decrease with increasing gas pressure. Quantitatively, the surface diffusion coefficients are lower than the bulk diffusion coefficients, predicted using the hard sphere model, owing to the restriction of graphene films. The reduction in diffusion coefficient is related to the simultaneously suppressed average frequency of molecular collisions and the average travelling distance between successive collisions. In addition, a lower diffusion coefficient on a hydrogen-functionalized graphene surface is identified, caused by the blocking effects of chemical functional groups.",

Granny smith). Drying was performed at 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C and 30%, 50%, 70%RH based on a 32 experimental design. The drying curves were analyzed to determine the effective diffusion (Deff) using two methods: Fick's second law and anomalous diffusion model based on fractional calculus approach. Our results showed that the anomalous diffusion mechanism fit the experimental data better and revealed a super-diffusive behavior (α > 1). Therefore, Deff values were estimated using the anomalous diffusion model with α = 1.735. With respect to the use of anomalous diffusion model solution based on fractional calculus at different operations conditions allow to get better fitting of drying data than second Fick's law model, even keeping the Arrhenius behavior of Deff with temperature. \n \nPractical applications \nDiffusion process is typically analyzed using models based on Fick's second law. However, several assumptions inherent in Fick's second law are not fulfilled in food materials (e.g., structural heterogeneity). In addition, Fick's second law does not consider structural variations during the drying process, and it is well known that fruits such as apples experience significant structural changes during drying. Fractional calculus is a tool for mathematically representing the anomalous diffusion of solutes whose movements can be faster or slower than postulated in Fick's second law due to food structure. In general, with second Fick's law model not good fitting to data are obtained, therefore the prediction capacity of the model is limited. Based on this, anomalous diffusion solution based on fractional calculus was applied. The results showed good fit the data to the model, and also by the time exponent (α) is possible to identify the kind of diffusion process.",

Using the example of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), we show the effect of polydispersity of probes on the experimental results. Although individual probes undergo normal diffusion, in the ensemble of probes, an effective broadening of the distribution of diffusion times occurs-similar to anomalous diffusion. We introduced fluorescently labeled dextrans into the cytoplasm of HeLa cells and found that cytoplasmic hydrodynamic drag, exponentially dependent on probe size, extraordinarily broadens the distribution of diffusion times across the focal volume. As a result, the in vivo FCS data were effectively fitted with the anomalous subdiffusion model while for a monodisperse probe the normal diffusion model was most suitable. Diffusion time obtained from the anomalous diffusion model corresponds to a probe whose size is determined by the weight-average molecular weight of the polymer. The apparent anomaly exponent decreases with increasing polydispersity of the probes. Our results and methodology can be applied in intracellular studies of the mobility of nanoparticles, polymers, or oligomerizing proteins.",

However, numerous scholars have found that a single diffusion coefficient cannot reproduce the sorption kinetic data precisely for a lot of coals, while bidisperse diffusion with fast and slow diffusion coefficients can represent the diffusion process well.

Specifically, we developed a new noise-removal model by combining the modified isotropic diffusion model and the modified Perona–Malik (PM) model. The novel hybrid model can adapt the diffusion process along the tangential direction of edges in the original image via a new control function based on the patch similarity modulus. In addition, the patch similarity modulus is used as the new structure indicator for the modified Perona–Malik model. The feature of second-order directional derivative of edge’s tangential direction allows the proposed model to reduce the aliasing and the noise around edge during edge preserving smoothing. The proposed method is thus able to efficiently preserve the edges, textures, thin lines, weak edges, and fine details, meanwhile preventing the staircase effects.

First, we work out the critical lines of Hopf and Turing bifurcations of the current model system in a 2D spatial domain by means of bifurcation theory. More specifically, the exact Turing region is specified in a two-parameter space. In effect, by choosing the cross-diffusion coefficient as one of the momentous parameter, we demonstrate that the model system undergoes a sequence of spatiotemporal patterns in a homogeneous environment through diffusion-driven instability. Our results via numerical simulation authenticate that cross-diffusion be able to create stationary patterns which enrich the findings of pattern formation in an ecosystem.",

We compare our results with those obtained for the SIS epidemic model with the spectral method applied to adjacency matrices. It turns out that diffusion times on finite Barabasi-Albert networks are at a minimum. This may be due to a little-known property of these networks: whereas the value of the assortativity coefficient is close to zero, they look disassortative if one considers only a bounded range of degrees, including the smallest ones, and slightly assortative on the range of the higher degrees. We also find that if the trickle-down character of the diffusion process is enhanced by a larger initial stimulus on the hubs (via a inhomogeneous linear term in the Bass model), the relative difference between the diffusion times for BA networks and uncorrelated networks is even larger, reaching, for instance, the 34% in a typical case on a network with 104 nodes.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, online social networks have gained tremendous popularity because of the massive number of online users, the fast spread of information, and strong inter-personal influence. However, due to the high complexity of the user interaction and the real-time changing of the online social networks, it is still a big challenge to model the spreading process of the information delicately and, then, to predict the information diffusion precisely. In this paper, we exploit a hydrodynamic model to describe the spreading process of the information in online social networks. By using the proposed hydrodynamic information diffusion prediction model (hydro-IDP), we can describe the spreading process of the information on both temporal and spatial perspectives. It is also helpful in extracting the characteristics of information diffusion (e.g., the information popularity, the user influence, and the diffusivity of social platform). We also consider the superimposed effect of the information diffusion resulted from influential users in the model. The high accuracy of the model results has illustrated that our proposed Hydro-IDP model is competent to describe and predict the spreading process of information in online social networks.",

Recently, it has been shown that diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) defines the most severely damaged DWI lesion that does not renormalize following early reperfusion. We postulated that the diffusion and kurtosis lesion mismatch experience heterogeneous hemodynamic and/or metabolic injury. We investigated tissue perfusion, pH, diffusion, kurtosis and relaxation from regions of the contralateral normal area, diffusion lesion, kurtosis lesion and their mismatch in an animal model of acute stroke. Our study revealed significant kurtosis and diffusion lesion volume mismatch (19.7 ± 10.7%, P < 0.01). Although there was no significant difference in perfusion and diffusion between the kurtosis lesion and kurtosis/diffusion lesion mismatch, we showed lower pH in the kurtosis lesion (pH = 6.64 ± 0.12) from that of the kurtosis/diffusion lesion mismatch (6.84 ± 0.11, P < 0.05). Moreover, pH in the kurtosis lesion and kurtosis/diffusion mismatch agreed well with literature values for regions of ischemic core and penumbra, respectively. Our work documented initial evidence that DKI may reveal the heterogeneous metabolic derangement within the commonly used DWI lesion.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion on social networks refers to the process where opinions are spread via the connected nodes. Given a set of observed information cascades, one can infer the underlying diffusion process for social network analysis. The independent cascade model (IC model) is a widely adopted diffusion model where a node is assumed to be activated independently by any one of its neighbors. In reality, how a node will be activated also depends on how its neighbors are connected and activated. For instance, the opinions from the neighbors of the same social group are often similar and thus redundant. In this paper, we extend the IC model by considering that: 1) the information coming from the connected neighbors are similar and 2) the underlying redundancy can be modeled using a dynamic structural diversity measure of the neighbors. Our proposed model assumes each node to be activated independently by different communities (or components) of its parent nodes, each weighted by its effective size. An expectation maximization algorithm is derived to infer the model parameters. We compare the performance of the proposed model with the basic IC model and its variants using both synthetic data sets and a real-world data set containing news stories and Web blogs. Our empirical results show that incorporating the community structure of neighbors and the structural diversity measure into the diffusion model significantly improves the accuracy of the model, at the expense of only a reasonable increase in run-time.",

Understanding how information propagates in such networks is important for personalization and recommendation in social search. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Community-level Information Diffusion (HCID) model to capture the information diffusion process in social networks. We introduce the notion of users' topic popularity as to enable our model to depict the information diffusion process which is both topic-aware (which topic the information is concerned with) and source-aware (where the information comes from). Instead of assuming homogeneity of social communities, we propose the notion of community hierarchy, where information diffusion across inter-level communities is uni-directional from the higher levels to the lower ones. We design a Gibbs sampling algorithm to infer model parameters and propose prediction methods for two information diffusion prediction tasks, the retweet prediction and the cascade prediction. Comparison experiments are conducted on two real datasets. Results show that our model achieves substantial improvement compared with the existing work.",

The concept of the Hausdorff fractal distance is introduced, which converges to the classical Euclidean distance with the varying orders tending to 1. The fundamental solution of the 3-D Hausdorff fractal derivative diffusion equation is proposed on the basis of the Hausdorff fractal distance. With the help of the properties of the Hausdorff derivative, the Huasdorff diffusion model is also found to be a kind of time-space dependent convection-diffusion equation underlying the anomalous diffusion behavior.",

        "abstract": "Guided image synthesis enables everyday users to create and edit photo-realistic images with minimum effort. The key challenge is balancing faithfulness to the user input (e.g., hand-drawn colored strokes) and realism of the synthesized image. Existing GAN-based methods attempt to achieve such balance using either conditional GANs or GAN inversions, which are challenging and often require additional training data or loss functions for individual applications. To address these issues, we introduce a new image synthesis and editing method, Stochastic Differential Editing (SDEdit), based on a diffusion model generative prior, which synthesizes realistic images by iteratively denoising through a stochastic differential equation (SDE). Given an input image with user guide of any type, SDEdit first adds noise to the input, then subsequently denoises the resulting image through the SDE prior to increase its realism. SDEdit does not require task-specific training or inversions and can naturally achieve the balance between realism and faithfulness. SDEdit significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GAN-based methods by up to 98.09% on realism and 91.72% on overall satisfaction scores, according to a human perception study, on multiple tasks, including stroke-based image synthesis and editing as well as image compositing.",

We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (\\aka, score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of 1024 x 1024 images for the first time from a score-based generative model.",

        "abstract": "Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are universal enzymes of organisms that live in the presence of oxygen. They catalyze the conversion of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Superoxide anions are the intended product of dedicated signaling enzymes as well as the byproduct of several metabolic processes including mitochondrial respiration. Through their activity, SOD enzymes control the levels of a variety of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species, thus both limiting the potential toxicity of these molecules and controlling broad aspects of cellular life that are regulated by their signaling functions. All aerobic organisms have multiple SOD proteins targeted to different cellular and subcellular locations, reflecting the slow diffusion and multiple sources of their substrate superoxide. This compartmentalization also points to the need for fine local control of ROS signaling and to the possibility for ROS to signal between compartments. In this review, we discuss studies in model organisms and humans, which reveal the dual roles of SOD enzymes in controlling damage and regulating signaling.",

        "abstract": "As research on secondary batteries becomes important, interest in analytical methods to examine the condition of secondary batteries is also increasing. Among these methods, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) method is one of the most attractive diagnostic techniques due to its convenience, quickness, accuracy, and low cost. However, since the obtained spectra are complicated signals representing several impedance elements, it is necessary to understand the whole electrochemical environment for a meaningful analysis. Based on the understanding of the whole system, the circuit elements constituting the cell can be obtained through construction of a physically sound circuit model. Therefore, this mini-review will explain how to construct a physically sound circuit model according to the characteristics of the battery cell system and then introduce the relationship between the obtained resistances of the bulk (Rb), charge transfer reaction (Rct), interface layer (RSEI), diffusion process (W) and battery characteristics, such as the state of charge (SOC), temperature, and state of health (SOH).",

        "abstract": "Social media has been developing rapidly in public due to its nature of spreading new information, which leads to rumors being circulated. Meanwhile, detecting rumors from such massive information in social media is becoming an arduous challenge. Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to discover rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network (RvNN) and so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account the patterns of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion in rumor detection. Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial characteristics of rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional graph model, named Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), to explore both characteristics by operating on both top-down and bottom-up propagation of rumors. It leverages a GCN with a top-down directed graph of rumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation; and a GCN with an opposite directed graph of rumor diffusion to capture the structures of rumor dispersion. Moreover, the information from source post is involved in each layer of GCN to enhance the influences from the roots of rumors. Encouraging empirical results on several benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.",

Companies operating in supply chains establish process and data integration through the specialized intermediate companies, whose role is to establish interoperability by mapping and integrating companyspecific data for various organizations and systems. This has typically caused high integration costs, and diffusion is slow. This paper investigates the requirements and functionalities of supply chain integration.

        "abstract": "Throughout Earth's history, drought has been a common crisis in terrestrial ecosystems; in human societies, it can cause famine, one of the Four Horsemen of the apocalypse. As the global hydrological cycle intensifies with global warming, deeper droughts and rewetting will alter, and possibly transform, ecosystems. Soil communities, however, seem more tolerant than plants or animals are to water stress—the main effects, in fact, on soil processes appear to be limited diffusion and the limited supply of resources to soil organisms. Thus, the rains that end a drought not only release soil microbes from stress but also create a resource pulse that fuels soil microbial activity. It remains unclear whether the effects of drought on soil processes result from drying or rewetting. It is also unclear whether the flush of activity on rewetting is driven by microbial growth or by the physical/chemical processes that mobilize organic matter. In this review, I discuss how soil water, and the lack of it, regulates microbial life and biogeochemical processes. I first focus on organismal-level responses and then consider how these influence whole-soil organic matter dynamics. A final focus is on how to incorporate these effects into Earth System models that can effectively capture dry–wet cycling.",

Individuals differ by age (young, retired), by sector (basic, luxury), and health status. Disease transmission occurs in the workplace, through consumption, at home, and in hospitals. We study the optimal economic mitigation policy for a government that can redistribute across individuals, but where redistribution is costly. Optimal redistribution and mitigation policies interact, and more modest shutdowns are optimal when redistribution is more costly. We find that the shutdowns that were implemented in mid-April were too extensive, but a partial shutdown should remain in place through the fall. A deeper and longer shutdown is preferred if a vaccine is imminent.",

It is therefore exciting to see that defects are now recognized to be similarly useful in tailoring properties of metal‐organic frameworks (MOFs). For instance, heterogeneous catalysis crucially depends on the number of active catalytic sites as well as on diffusion limitations. By the incorporation of missing linker and missing node defects into MOFs, both parameters can be accessed, improving the catalytic properties. Furthermore, the creation of defects allows for adding properties such as electronic conductivity, which are inherently absent in the parent MOFs. Herein, progress of the rapidly evolving field of the past two years is overviewed, putting a focus on properties that are altered by the incorporation and even tailoring of defects in MOFs. A brief account is also given on the emerging quantitative understanding of defects and heterogeneity in MOFs based on scale‐bridging computational modeling and simulations.",

        "abstract": "\n <p>Following its release and corresponding publication in GMD, we present the Lagrangian model FLEXPART 10.4, which simulates the transport, diffusion, dry and wet deposition, radioactive decay and first order chemical reactions of atmospheric tracers. The model has been recently updated, both technical and in the representation of physico-chemical processes.<span>&#160;</span></p><p>FLEXPART was in its original version in the mid-1990s designed for calculating the long-range and mesoscale dispersion of hazardous substances from point sources, such as released after an accident in a nuclear power plant. Given suitable meteorological input data, it can be used for scales from dozens of meters to the global scale. In particular, inverse modelling based on source-receptor relationships from FLEXPART has become widely used. In this paper, we present FLEXPART version 10.4, which works with meteorological input data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts&#8217; (ECMWF) Integrated Forecast System (IFS), and data from the United States&#8217; National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS). Since the last publication of a detailed FLEXPART description (version 6.2), the model has been improved in different aspects such as performance, physico-chemical parametrizations, input/output formats and available pre- and post-processing software. The model code has also been parallelized using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). We demonstrate that the model scales well up to using 256 processors, with a parallel efficiency greater than 75% for up to 64 processes on multiple nodes in runs with very large numbers of particles. The deviation from 100% efficiency is almost entirely due to remaining non-parallelized parts of the code, suggesting large potential for further speed-up. A new turbulence scheme for the convective boundary layer has been developed that considers the skewness in the vertical velocity distribution (updrafts and downdrafts) and vertical gradients in air density. FLEXPART is the only model available considering both effects, making it highly accurate for small-scale applications, e.g. to quantify dispersion in the vicinity of a point source. The wet deposition scheme for aerosols has been completely rewritten and a new, more detailed gravitational settling parameterization for aerosols has also been implemented. FLEXPART has had the option for running backward in time from atmospheric concentrations at receptor locations for many years, but this has now been extended to work also for deposition values . To our knowledge, to date FLEXPART is the only model with that capability. Furthermore, temporal variation and temperature dependence of chemical reactions with the OH radical have been included, allowing more accurate simulations for species with intermediate lifetimes against the reaction with OH, such as ethane. Finally, user settings can now be specified in a more flexible namelist format, and output files can be produced in NetCDF format instead of FLEXPART&#8217;s customary binary format. In this paper, we describe these new developments. Moreover, we present some<span>&#160;</span> tools for the preparation of the meteorological input data and for processing of FLEXPART output data and briefly report on alternative FLEXPART versions.<span>&#160;</span></p>\n",

        "abstract": "Abstract For the first time in history, on March 17, 2020, the European Union closed all its external borders in an attempt to contain the spreading of the coronavirus 2019, COVID-19. Throughout two past months, governments around the world have implemented massive travel restrictions and border control to mitigate the outbreak of this global pandemic. However, the precise effects of travel restrictions on the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 remain unknown. Here we combine a global network mobility model with a local epidemiology model to simulate and predict the outbreak dynamics and outbreak control of COVID-19 across Europe. We correlate our mobility model to passenger air travel statistics and calibrate our epidemiology model using the number of reported COVID-19 cases for each country. Our simulations show that mobility networks of air travel can predict the emerging global diffusion pattern of a pandemic at the early stages of the outbreak. Our results suggest that an unconstrained mobility would have significantly accelerated the spreading of COVID-19, especially in Central Europe, Spain, and France. Ultimately, our network epidemiology model can inform political decision making and help identify exit strategies from current travel restrictions and total lockdown.",

        "abstract": "The pseudo-second-order (PSO) kinetic model has become among the most popular ways to fit rate data for adsorption of metal ions, dyes, and other compounds from aqueous solution onto cellulose-based materials. This review first considers published evidence regarding the validity of the mechanistic assumptions underlying application of the PSO model to adsorption kinetics. A literal interpretation of the model requires an assumption that different adsorption sites on a solid substrate randomly collide with each other during a rate-limiting mechanistic step. Because of problems revealed by the literature regarding the usual assumptions associated with the PSO model, this review also considers how else to account for good fits of adsorption data to the PSO model. Studies have shown that adsorption behavior that fits the PSO model well often can be explained by diffusion-based mechanisms. Hypothetical data generated using the assumption of pseudo-first-order rate behavior has been shown to fit the PSO model very well. In light of published evidence, adsorption kinetics of cellulosic materials is expected to mainly depend on diffusion-limited processes, as affected by heterogeneous distributions of pore sizes and continual partitioning of solute species between a dissolved state and a fixed state of adsorption.",

The participants had to examine a mobile application of the largest European bank. In the proposed model, an approach to external influences was included, theoretically and originally stated by Davis et al. (1989) . The proposed model was empirically tested using data collected from an online survey applying structural equation modeling (SEM). The results obtained in this study demonstrate how attitude determine mainly the intended use of mobile apps, discarding usefulness and risk as factors that directly improve its use. Finally, the study shows the main management implications and identifies certain strategies to reinforce this new business in the context of new technological advances.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To develop and validate a radiomics model for evaluating pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Experimental Design: We enrolled 222 patients (152 in the primary cohort and 70 in the validation cohort) with clinicopathologically confirmed LARC who received chemoradiotherapy before surgery. All patients underwent T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging before and after chemoradiotherapy; 2,252 radiomic features were extracted from each patient before and after treatment imaging. The two-sample t test and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used for feature selection, whereupon a radiomics signature was built with support vector machines. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then used to develop a radiomics model incorporating the radiomics signature and independent clinicopathologic risk factors. The performance of the radiomics model was assessed by its calibration, discrimination, and clinical usefulness with independent validation. Results: The radiomics signature comprised 30 selected features and showed good discrimination performance in both the primary and validation cohorts. The individualized radiomics model, which incorporated the radiomics signature and tumor length, also showed good discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9756 (95% confidence interval, 0.9185–0.9711) in the validation cohort, and good calibration. Decision curve analysis confirmed the clinical utility of the radiomics model. Conclusions: Using pre- and posttreatment MRI data, we developed a radiomics model with excellent performance for individualized, noninvasive prediction of pCR. This model may be used to identify LARC patients who can omit surgery after chemoradiotherapy. Clin Cancer Res; 23(23); 7253–62. ©2017 AACR.",

Our results are consistent with a model in which many farmers need to learn from multiple people before they adopt themselves.

        "abstract": "Item Response Theory (IRT) is widely applied in the human sciences to model persons' responses on a set of items measuring one or more latent constructs. While several R packages have been developed that implement IRT models, they tend to be restricted to respective prespecified classes of models. Further, most implementations are frequentist while the availability of Bayesian methods remains comparably limited. We demonstrate how to use the R package brms together with the probabilistic programming language Stan to specify and fit a wide range of Bayesian IRT models using flexible and intuitive multilevel formula syntax. Further, item and person parameters can be related in both a linear or non-linear manner. Various distributions for categorical, ordinal, and continuous responses are supported. Users may even define their own custom response distribution for use in the presented framework. Common IRT model classes that can be specified natively in the presented framework include 1PL and 2PL logistic models optionally also containing guessing parameters, graded response and partial credit ordinal models, as well as drift diffusion models of response times coupled with binary decisions. Posterior distributions of item and person parameters can be conveniently extracted and post-processed. Model fit can be evaluated and compared using Bayes factors and efficient cross-validation procedures.",

This spread have been suggested to be related to the similarly problematized phenomenon of “echo chambers”, but the causal nature of this relationship has proven difficult to disentangle due to the connected nature of social media, whose causality is characterized by complexity, non-linearity and emergence. This paper uses a network simulation model to study a possible relationship between echo chambers and the viral spread of misinformation. It finds an “echo chamber effect”: the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions, and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network polarization on the virality of misinformation. The echo chambers effect likely comes from that they form the initial bandwagon for diffusion. These findings have implication for the study of the media logic of new social media.",

        "abstract": "A new type of deacetylated cellulose acetate (DA)@polydopamine (PDA) composite nanofiber membrane was fabricated by electrospinning and surface modification. The membrane was applied as a highly efficient adsorbent for removing methylene blue (MB) from an aqueous solution. The morphology, surface chemistry, surface wettability, and effects of operating conditions on MB adsorption ability, as well as the equilibrium, kinetics, thermodynamics, and mechanism of adsorption, were systematically studied. The results demonstrated that a uniform PDA coating layer was successfully developed on the surface of DA nanofibers. The adsorption capacity of the DA@PDA nanofiber membrane reached up to 88.2 mg/g at a temperature of 25 °C and a pH of 6.5 after adsorption for 30 h, which is about 8.6 times higher than that of DA nanofibers. The experimental results showed that the adsorption behavior of DA@PDA composite nanofibers followed the Weber’s intraparticle diffusion model, pseudo-second-order model, and Langmuir isothermal model. A thermodynamic analysis indicated that endothermic, spontaneous, and physisorption processes occurred. Based on the experimental results, the adsorption mechanism of DA@PDA composite nanofibers was also demonstrated.",

Hydrated vanadium bronzes have gained significant attention for AZIBs and can be produced with a range of different pre‐intercalated ions, allowing their properties to be optimized. However, gaining a detailed understanding of the energy storage mechanisms within these cathode materials remains a great challenge due to their complex crystallographic frameworks, limiting rational design from the perspective of enhanced Zn2+ diffusion over multiple length scales. Herein, a new class of hydrated porous δ‐Ni0.25V2O5.nH2O nanoribbons for use as an AZIB cathode is reported. The cathode delivers reversibility showing 402 mAh g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 and a capacity retention of 98% over 1200 cycles at 5 A g−1. A detailed investigation using experimental and computational approaches reveal that the host “δ” vanadate lattice has favorable Zn2+ diffusion properties, arising from the atomic‐level structure of the well‐defined lattice channels. Furthermore, the microstructure of the as‐prepared cathodes is examined using multi‐length scale X‐ray computed tomography for the first time in AZIBs and the effective diffusion coefficient is obtained by image‐based modeling, illustrating favorable porosity and satisfactory tortuosity.",

        "abstract": "The transdermal route of drugs has received increased attention in recent years due to numerous advantages over the oral and injectable routes, such as avoidance of the hepatic metabolism, protection of drugs from the gastrointestinal tract, sustained drug delivery, and good patient compliance. The assessment of ex vivo permeation during the pharmaceutical development process helps in understanding the product quality and performance of a transdermal delivery system. Generally, excised human skin relevant to the application site or animal skin is recommended for ex vivo permeation studies. However, the limited availability of the human skin and ethical issues surrounding the use of animal skin rendered these models less attractive in the permeation study. In the last three decades, enormous efforts have been put into developing artificial membranes and 3D cultured human skin models as surrogates to the human skin. This manuscript provides an insight on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidelines for permeation studies and the parameters affected when using Franz diffusion cells in the permeation study. The need and possibilities for skin alternatives, such as artificially cultured human skin models, parallel artificial membrane permeability assays (PAMPA), and artificial membranes for penetration and permeation studies, are comprehensively discussed.",

        "title": "Coordination between microbiota and root endodermis supports plant mineral nutrient homeostasis",
        "abstract": "Microbes modify plant root permeability The root provides mineral nutrients and water to the plant. Diffusion barriers seal the root, preventing the loss of internal water and nutrients. Salas-González et al. found that microbes living on and in roots of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana influence diffusion barrier formation, which affects the balance of mineral nutrients in the plant (see the Perspective by Busch and Chory). Plants with modified root diffusion barriers show altered bacterial community composition. Microbes tap into the plant's abscisic acid hormone signals to stabilize the root diffusion barrier against perturbations in environmental nutrient availability, thus enhancing plant stress tolerance. Science, this issue p. eabd0695; see also p. 125 Genes that control root endodermal function in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contribute to the plant root microbiome assembly. INTRODUCTION All living organisms have evolved homeostatic mechanisms to control their mineral nutrient and trace element content (ionomes). In plant roots and animal guts, these mechanisms involve specialized cell layers that function as a diffusion barrier to water, solutes, and immunoactive ligands. To perform this role, it is essential that the cells forming these layers are tightly sealed together. Additionally, these cells must perform their homeostatic function while interacting with the local microbiota. In animals, resident microbes influence the function of intestinal diffusion barriers and, in some cases, miscoordination of this interplay can cause dysbiosis. In plants, two types of extracellular root diffusion barriers have been characterized at the endodermis: Casparian strips, which seal cells together, and suberin deposits, which influence transport across the cell plasma membrane. Whether and how these root diffusion barriers coordinate with the microbiota inhabiting the root is unknown. Such coordination could influence plant performance, agronomic yields, and the nutritional quality of crops. RATIONALE We explored and characterized the interplay between the regulatory networks controlling the performance of the root diffusion barrier and the functionally complex and metabolically dynamic microbiota inhabiting the root. To address this, we explored the presumptive reciprocal nature of this interaction using two complementary approaches. First, we profiled the microbiome of a collection of plants with a range of specific alterations to the root diffusion barrier to determine whether the regulatory network controlling the synthesis and deposition of the barrier components also controls the structure of the root microbiome. Second, we deployed a collection of bacterial strains isolated from the shoots and roots of plants grown in natural soils to establish the influence of the microbiome over root barrier function. Last, we coupled both approaches to identify the molecular links between the root diffusion barrier and their associated microbiota. RESULTS We analyzed a nonredundant and diverse collection of 19 root diffusion barrier mutants and overexpression lines to reveal the influence of the root diffusion barrier regulatory network on the assembly of the plant microbiota. We screened 416 individual bacterial strains for their ability to modify the function of the Casparian strip and suberin deposits in the endodermis and uncovered a new role for the plant microbiota in influencing root diffusion barrier functions with an impact on plant mineral nutrient homeostasis. We designed and deployed a bacterial synthetic community combined with ionomics and transcriptomics to discover the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordination between root diffusion barriers and the plant microbiota. Our research has three main findings: (i) The regulatory network controlling the endodermal root diffusion barriers also influences the composition of the plant microbiota; (ii) individual members of the plant microbiome, bacterial synthetic communities, or natural microbial communities control the development of endodermal diffusion barriers, especially suberin deposition, with consequences for the plant’s ionome and abiotic stress tolerance; and (iii) the capacity of the plant microbiome to influence root diffusion barrier function is mediated by its suppression of signaling dependent on the phytohormone abscisic acid. CONCLUSION Our findings that the plant microbiome influences root diffusion barrier function generalizes the role of the microbiome in controlling cellular diffusion barriers across kingdoms. In addition, we defined the molecular basis of how diffusion barriers in multicellular organisms incorporate microbial function to regulate mineral nutrient balance. This discovery has potential applications in plant and human nutrition and food quality and safety. Microbial-based strategies to control suberization of plant roots presents new opportunities to design more resilient crops, new biofortification strategies, and carbon-sequestration approaches. The microbiota influences root diffusion barriers. (A) Model showing the interplay between the microbiota and root diffusion barriers. Microbes influence Casparian strip synthesis and co-opt plant-based abscisic acid signaling to control endodermal suberization. (B) Schematic representation of suberin accumulation in plants grown under axenic conditions or with the root microbiota. Root-inhabiting microbes reduce endodermal suberization optimizing mineral nutrient homeostasis and abiotic stress responses in the plant. Plant roots and animal guts have evolved specialized cell layers to control mineral nutrient homeostasis. These layers must tolerate the resident microbiota while keeping homeostatic integrity. Whether and how the root diffusion barriers in the endodermis, which are critical for the mineral nutrient balance of plants, coordinate with the microbiota is unknown. We demonstrate that genes controlling endodermal function in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana contribute to the plant microbiome assembly. We characterized a regulatory mechanism of endodermal differentiation driven by the microbiota with profound effects on nutrient homeostasis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this mechanism is linked to the microbiota’s capacity to repress responses to the phytohormone abscisic acid in the root. Our findings establish the endodermis as a regulatory hub coordinating microbiota assembly and homeostatic mechanisms.",

Drying of the droplet is predicted by using a diffusion-limited evaporation model for a sessile droplet placed on a partially wetted surface with a pinned contact line. The variation in droplet volume, contact angle, ambient temperature, and humidity are considered. We analyze the chances of the survival of the virus present in the droplet based on the lifetime of the droplets under several conditions and find that the chances of the survival of the virus are strongly affected by each of these parameters. The magnitude of shear stress inside the droplet computed using the model is not large enough to obliterate the virus. We also explore the relationship between the drying time of a droplet and the growth rate of the spread of COVID-19 in five different cities and find that they are weakly correlated.",

In the model, one layer represents a social network with positive and negative preventive information spreading competitively, while the other one denotes the physical contact network with epidemic propagation. The individuals who are aware of positive prevention will take more effective measures to avoid being infected than those who are aware of negative prevention. Taking the microscopic Markov chain (MMC) approach, we analytically derive the expression of the epidemic threshold for the proposed epidemic model, which indicates that the diffusion of positive and negative prevention information, as well as the topology of the physical contact network have a significant impact on the epidemic threshold. By comparing the results obtained with MMC and those with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, it is found that they are in good agreement, but MMC can well describe the dynamics of the proposed model. Meanwhile, through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the impact of positive and negative preventive information on the epidemic threshold, as well as the prevalence of infectious diseases. We also find that the epidemic prevalence and the epidemic outbreaks can be suppressed by the diffusion of positive preventive information and be promoted by the diffusion of negative preventive information.",

In this paper, we propose a new version of such a methodology, a framework for its analysis, and numerical evidence of the practicality of the method proposed. Our starting point is an ensemble of over-damped Langevin diffusions which interact through a single preconditioner computed as the empirical ensemble covariance. We demonstrate that the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation arising from the mean-field limit of the associated stochastic differential equation (SDE) has a novel gradient flow structure, built on the Wasserstein metric and the covariance matrix of the noisy flow. Using this structure, we investigate large time properties of the Fokker-Planck equation, showing that its invariant measure coincides with that of a single Langevin diffusion, and demonstrating exponential convergence to the invariant measure in a number of settings. We introduce a new noisy variant on ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI) algorithms found from the original SDE by replacing exact gradients with ensemble differences; this defines the ensemble Kalman sampler (EKS). Numerical results are presented which demonstrate its efficacy as a derivative-free approximate sampler for the Bayesian posterior arising from inverse problems.",

In this Letter, first-row transition-metal sulfides (TMSs) are selected as the model system to obtain a general principle for the rational design of a sulfur cathode. The strong S-binding that is induced by charge transfer between transition-metal atoms in TMS slabs and S atoms in Li2S is confirmed to be of great significance in TMS composite cathodes.

The second law of thermodynamics was applied to analyze the fluid flow, heat and mass transport as well as the aspects of entropy generation using Buongiorno model. Thermophoresis and Brownian diffusion is considered which appears due to the concentration and random motion of nanoparticles in base fluid, respectively. Uniform magnetic effect is induced but the assumption of tiny magnetic Reynolds number results in zero magnetic induction. The governing equations (PDEs) are transformed into ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using appropriately adjusted transformations. The numerical method is used for solving the so-formulated highly nonlinear problem. The graphical presentation of results highlights that the heat flux receives enhancement for augmented Brownian diffusion. The Bejan number is found to be increasing with a larger Weissenberg number. The tabulated results for skin-friction, Nusselt number and Sherwood number are given.

        "abstract": "Simulating transport with cold atoms Much can be learned about the nature of a solid from how charge and spin propagate through it. Transport experiments can also be performed in quantum simulators such as cold atom systems, in which individual atoms can be imaged using quantum microscopes. Now, two groups have investigated transport in the so-called Fermi-Hubbard model using a two-dimensional optical lattice filled with one fermionic atom per site (see the Perspective by Brantut). Moving away from half-filling to enable charge transport, Brown et al. found that the resistivity had a linear temperature dependence, not unlike that seen in the strange metal phase of cuprate superconductors. In a complementary study on spin transport, Nichols et al. observed spin diffusion driven by superexchange coupling. Science, this issue p. 379, p. 383; see also p. 344 Atomic transport in a 2D optical lattice is investigated in the strongly interacting regime at or near half-filling. Strong interactions in many-body quantum systems complicate the interpretation of charge transport in such materials. To shed light on this problem, we study transport in a clean quantum system: ultracold lithium-6 in a two-dimensional optical lattice, a testing ground for strong interaction physics in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We determine the diffusion constant by measuring the relaxation of an imposed density modulation and modeling its decay hydrodynamically. The diffusion constant is converted to a resistivity by using the Nernst-Einstein relation. That resistivity exhibits a linear temperature dependence and shows no evidence of saturation, two characteristic signatures of a bad metal. The techniques we developed in this study may be applied to measurements of other transport quantities, including the optical conductivity and thermopower.",

        "abstract": "Significance Protein-folding kinetics is often described as Markovian (i.e., memoryless) diffusion in a one-dimensional free energy landscape, governed by an instantaneous friction coefficient that is fitted to reproduce experimental or simulated folding times. For the α-helix forming polypeptide alanine9 and a specific reaction coordinate that consists of the summed native hydrogen-bond lengths, we demonstrate that the friction extracted from molecular dynamics simulations exhibits significant memory with a decay time that is in the nanosecond range and thus, of the same order as the folding and unfolding times. Our non-Markovian modeling not only reproduces the molecular dynamics simulations accurately but also demonstrates that memory friction effects lead to anomalous and drastically accelerated protein kinetics. We extract the folding free energy landscape and the time-dependent friction function, the two ingredients of the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), from explicit-water molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the α-helix forming polypeptide alanine9 for a one-dimensional reaction coordinate based on the sum of the native H-bond distances. Folding and unfolding times from numerical integration of the GLE agree accurately with MD results, which demonstrate the robustness of our GLE-based non-Markovian model. In contrast, Markovian models do not accurately describe the peptide kinetics and in particular, cannot reproduce the folding and unfolding kinetics simultaneously, even if a spatially dependent friction profile is used. Analysis of the GLE demonstrates that memory effects in the friction significantly speed up peptide folding and unfolding kinetics, as predicted by the Grote–Hynes theory, and are the cause of anomalous diffusion in configuration space. Our methods are applicable to any reaction coordinate and in principle, also to experimental trajectories from single-molecule experiments. Our results demonstrate that a consistent description of protein-folding dynamics must account for memory friction effects.",

However, accurately inferring information from SPT studies is challenging due to biases in both data analysis and experimental design. To address analysis bias, we introduce ‘Spot-On’, an intuitive web-interface. Spot-On implements a kinetic modeling framework that accounts for known biases, including molecules moving out-of-focus, and robustly infers diffusion constants and subpopulations from pooled single-molecule trajectories. To minimize inherent experimental biases, we implement and validate stroboscopic photo-activation SPT (spaSPT), which minimizes motion-blur bias and tracking errors. We validate Spot-On using experimentally realistic simulations and show that Spot-On outperforms other methods. We then apply Spot-On to spaSPT data from live mammalian cells spanning a wide range of nuclear dynamics and demonstrate that Spot-On consistently and robustly infers subpopulation fractions and diffusion constants.",

The kinetic data were fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic; the rate constant K increased when temperature increased indicating the adsorption was endothermic in nature. The studies related to the adsorption mechanism illuminated that the AO7 adsorption process was complex and obeyed both surface adsorption and particle diffusion. Moreover, based on the results, the adsorption happens through film diffusion at low concentrations while the particle diffusion is the rate-determining step at higher concentration. The isotherm equations showed that the equilibrium data followed more than the Langmuir isotherm with a maximum adsorption capacity of 181.4 mg/g. The thermodynamic parameters were calculated, and their negative value of ΔG° and positive value of ΔS° and ΔH° showed that the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic.",

In the first stage, defensive reporting, companies fail to meet stakeholder expectations due to a deficiency in firm performance. In this stage, the decision to report is driven by coercive isomorphism as firms sense pressure to close the expectational gap. In the second stage, proactive reporting, knowledge of CSR reporting spreads and the practice of CSR reporting becomes normatively sanctioned. In this stage, normative isomorphism leads other organizations to look to CSR reporting as a potential new opportunity for achieving the firm’s goals. In the third stage, imitative diffusion, the defensive reporters together with the proactive reporters create a critical mass of CSR reporters that reaches a threshold at which the benefits of CSR reporting begin to outweigh any costs due to mimetic isomorphism.

        "abstract": "Underground hydrogen storage is a potential way to balance seasonal fluctuations in energy production from renewable energies. The risks of hydrogen storage in depleted gas fields include the conversion of hydrogen to CH4(g) and H2S(g) due to microbial activity, gas–water–rock interactions in the reservoir and cap rock, which are connected with porosity changes, and the loss of aqueous hydrogen by diffusion through the cap rock brine. These risks lead to loss of hydrogen and thus to a loss of energy. A hydrogeochemical modeling approach is developed to analyze these risks and to understand the basic hydrogeochemical mechanisms of hydrogen storage over storage times at the reservoir scale. The one-dimensional diffusive mass transport model is based on equilibrium reactions for gas–water–rock interactions and kinetic reactions for sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The modeling code is PHREEQC (pH-REdox-EQuilibrium written in the C programming language). The parameters that influence the hydrogen loss are identified. Crucial parameters are the amount of available electron acceptors, the storage time, and the kinetic rate constants. Hydrogen storage causes a slight decrease in porosity of the reservoir rock. Loss of aqueous hydrogen by diffusion is minimal. A wide range of conditions for optimized hydrogen storage in depleted gas fields is identified.",

The latent variable model maps similar deformations close to each other in an encoding space. It enables to compare deformations, to generate normal or pathological deformations for any new image, or to transport deformations from one image pair to any other image. Our unsupervised method is based on the variational inference. In particular, we use a conditional variational autoencoder network and constrain transformations to be symmetric and diffeomorphic by applying a differentiable exponentiation layer with a symmetric loss function. We also present a formulation that includes spatial regularization such as the diffusion-based filters. In addition, our framework provides multi-scale velocity field estimations. We evaluated our method on 3-D intra-subject registration using 334 cardiac cine-MRIs. On this dataset, our method showed the state-of-the-art performance with a mean DICE score of 81.2% and a mean Hausdorff distance of 7.3 mm using 32 latent dimensions compared to three state-of-the-art methods while also demonstrating more regular deformation fields. The average time per registration was 0.32 s. Besides, we visualized the learned latent space and showed that the encoded deformations can be used to transport deformations and to cluster diseases with a classification accuracy of 83% after applying a linear projection.",

Specifically, Fokker-Planck equations, which model the diffusion of probability measures, can be understood as gradient descent over entropy functionals in Wasserstein space. This equivalence, introduced by Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto, inspired the so-called JKO scheme to approximate these diffusion processes via an implicit discretization of the gradient flow in Wasserstein space. Solving the optimization problem associated to each JKO step, however, presents serious computational challenges. We introduce a scalable method to approximate Wasserstein gradient flows, targeted to machine learning applications. Our approach relies on input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to discretize the JKO steps, which can be optimized by stochastic gradient descent. Unlike previous work, our method does not require domain discretization or particle simulation. As a result, we can sample from the measure at each time step of the diffusion and compute its probability density. We demonstrate our algorithm's performance by computing diffusions following the Fokker-Planck equation and apply it to unnormalized density sampling as well as nonlinear filtering.",

We observe the localization of interlayer excitons at low temperature and the temperature-activated diffusivity as a function of twist angle and hence attribute it to the deep periodic potentials arising from the moiré superlattice.

Budin et al. used genetic engineering to influence the concentration of unsaturated branched-chain fatty acids and thus control membrane viscosity (see the Perspective by Schon). Experimental measurements and mathematical modeling indicated that rates of respiratory metabolism and rates of cell growth were dependent on membrane viscosity and its effects on diffusion. Experiments on yeast mitochondria also showed similar effects. Maintaining efficient respiration may thus place evolutionary constraints on cellular lipid composition. Science, this issue p. 1186; see also p. 1114 Metabolic engineering of membrane viscosity can regulate respiration rates in Escherichia coli and in yeast mitochondria. Lipid composition determines the physical properties of biological membranes and can vary substantially between and within organisms. We describe a specific role for the viscosity of energy-transducing membranes in cellular respiration. Engineering of fatty acid biosynthesis in Escherichia coli allowed us to titrate inner membrane viscosity across a 10-fold range by controlling the abundance of unsaturated or branched lipids. These fluidizing lipids tightly controlled respiratory metabolism, an effect that can be explained with a quantitative model of the electron transport chain (ETC) that features diffusion-coupled reactions between enzymes and electron carriers (quinones). Lipid unsaturation also modulated mitochondrial respiration in engineered budding yeast strains. Thus, diffusion in the ETC may serve as an evolutionary constraint for lipid composition in respiratory membranes.",

        "abstract": "The kinetics of energy storage in transition metal oxides are usually limited by solid-state diffusion, and the strategy most often utilized to improve their rate capability is to reduce ion diffusion distances by utilizing nanostructured materials. Here, another strategy for improving the kinetics of layered transition metal oxides by the presence of structural water is proposed. To investigate this strategy, the electrochemical energy storage behavior of a model hydrated layered oxide, WO3·2H2O, is compared with that of anhydrous WO3 in an acidic electrolyte. It is found that the presence of structural water leads to a transition from battery-like behavior in the anhydrous WO3 to ideally pseudocapacitive behavior in WO3·2H2O. As a result, WO3·2H2O exhibits significantly improved capacity retention and energy efficiency for proton storage over WO3 at sweep rates as fast as 200 mV s–1, corresponding to charge/discharge times of just a few seconds. Importantly, the energy storage of WO3·2H2O at such rates ...",

        "abstract": "Spontaneous solute and solvent permeation through membranes is of vital importance to human life, be it gas exchange in red blood cells, metabolite excretion, drug/toxin uptake, or water homeostasis. Knowledge of the underlying molecular mechanisms is the sine qua non of every functional assignment to membrane transporters. The basis of our current solubility diffusion model was laid by Meyer and Overton. It correlates the solubility of a substance in an organic phase with its membrane permeability. Since then, a wide range of studies challenging this rule have appeared. Commonly, the discrepancies have their origin in ill-used measurement approaches, as we demonstrate on the example of membrane CO2 transport. On the basis of the insight that scanning electrochemical microscopy offered into solute concentration distributions in immediate membrane vicinity of planar membranes, we analyzed the interplay between chemical reactions and diffusion for solvent transport, weak acid permeation, and enzymatic reactions adjacent to membranes. We conclude that buffer reactions must also be considered in spectroscopic investigations of weak acid transport in vesicular suspensions. The evaluation of energetic contributions to membrane translocation of charged species demonstrates the compatibility of the resulting membrane current with the solubility diffusion model. A local partition coefficient that depends on membrane penetration depth governs spontaneous membrane translocation of both charged and uncharged molecules. It is determined not only by the solubility in an organic phase but also by other factors like cholesterol concentration and intrinsic electric membrane potentials.",

        "abstract": "Understanding Li nucleation and growth mechanism is an essential key for providing a long cycle life and safe lithium ion batteries or lithium metal batteries. However, no quantitative report on Li metal deposition is found to the best of our knowledge. We proposed a model for quantitatively understanding Li nucleation and growth mechanism associated with SEI formation named as Li-SEI model. The current transients at various overpotentials initiate the nucleation and growth of Li metal on bare Cu foil. The Li-SEI model considering 3D diffusion-controlled instantaneous process (j3D-DC) with the simultaneous reduction of electrolyte decomposition (jSEI) due to the SEI fracture is employed for investigating the Li nucleation and growth mechanism. The individual contributions of experimental and theoretical transients state that the fundamental kinetic values of diffusion coefficient (D), rate of nucleation (N0) and rate constant of electrolyte decomposition (kSEI) are possibly determined from the Li-SEI model. Interestingly, the JSEI increases with time, indicating that the current contributing from the electrolyte decomposition increases with time due to the SEI fracture upon Li deposition. Meanwhile, the kSEI increases with overpotential, indicating the SEI fracture is more serious at higher overpotential or higher growth rate. The kSEI is smaller in the electrolyte with FEC additive, indicating that FEC additive can significantly suppress the SEI fracture during Li metal deposition. This proposed model opens a new way to quantitatively understand Li nucleation and growth mechanism and electrolyte decomposition on various substrates or in different electrolytes.",

        "abstract": "Nonaqueous polyelectrolyte solutions have been recently proposed as high Li+ transference number electrolytes for lithium ion batteries. However, the atomistic phenomena governing ion diffusion and migration in polyelectrolytes are poorly understood, particularly in nonaqueous solvents. Here, the structural and transport properties of a model polyelectrolyte solution, poly(allyl glycidyl ether-lithium sulfonate) in dimethyl sulfoxide, are studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the static structural analysis of Li+ ion pairing is insufficient to fully explain the overall conductivity trend, necessitating a dynamic analysis of the diffusion mechanism, in which we observe a shift from largely vehicular transport to more structural diffusion as the Li+ concentration increases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that despite the significantly higher diffusion coefficient of the lithium ion, the negatively charged polyion is responsible for the majority of the solution conductivity at all concentrations, corresponding to Li+ transference numbers much lower than previously estimated experimentally. We quantify the ion–ion correlations unique to polyelectrolyte systems that are responsible for this surprising behavior. These results highlight the need to reconsider the approximations typically made for transport in polyelectrolyte solutions.",

The nitrogen incorporation and narrow microporosity are the two major factors that determine CO2 uptake for these graphene-derived carbonaceous adsorbents under ambient conditions. The adsorption kinetic data of the optimized sample were well-described by the classical Fick’s diffusion model with a high CO2 diffusion rate. The fast CO2 adsorption kinetics can be attributed to the short diffusion paths of this sample, which is composed of thin layers of graphene sheets.

        "abstract": "Recent results from animal irradiation studies have demonstrated the potential of ultra-high dose rate irradiation (also known as FLASH) for reducing radiation toxicity in normal tissues. However, despite mounting evidence of a ‘FLASH effect’, a mechanism has yet to be elucidated. This article hypothesizes that the radioprotecting effect of FLASH irradiation could be due to the specific sparing of hypoxic stem cell niches, which have been identified in several organs including the bone marrow and the brain. To explore this hypothesis, a new computational model is presented that frames transient radiolytic oxygen depletion (ROD) during FLASH irradiation in terms of its effect on the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER). The model takes into consideration oxygen diffusion through the tissue, its consumption by metabolic cells, and its radiolytic depletion to estimate the relative decrease in radiosensitivity of cells receiving FLASH irradiation. Based on this model and the following parameters (oxygen diffusion constant   =  2 · 10−5 cm2 s−1, oxygen metabolic rate m  =  3 mmHg s−1, ROD rate LROD  =   mmHg Gy−1, prescribed dose Dp  =  10 Gy, and capillary oxygen tension p 0  =  40 mmHg), several predictions are made that could be tested in future experiments: (1) the FLASH effect should gradually disappear as the radiation pulse duration is increased from  <1 s to 10 s; (2) dose should be deposited using the smallest number of radiation pulses to achieve the greatest FLASH effect; (3) a FLASH effect should only be observed in cells that are already hypoxic at the time of irradiation; and (4) changes in capillary oxygen tension (increase or decrease) should diminish the FLASH effect.",

        "abstract": "Significance Understanding and controlling the ion migration in a solid-state semiconductor is essential for device performance in modern photonics, electronics, and optoelectronics. Direct microstructural observation and atomic-scale mechanism of the intrinsic lattice diffusion are still highly challenging. Here, we report the direct visualization of halide anion interdiffusion in CsPbCl3–CsPbBr3 single crystalline nanowire heterojunctions via nanoscale imaging, allowing for the direct measuring of intrinsic lattice diffusivities. The intrinsic halide diffusivities were found to be several orders of magnitudes lower than those reported in polycrystalline thin films. Together with multiscale modeling, we further demonstrate how anionic diffusion in lead halides is determined by low barriers to vacancy hopping and facilitated by the soft perovskite lattice. Facile ionic transport in lead halide perovskites plays a critical role in device performance. Understanding the microscopic origins of high ionic conductivities has been complicated by indirect measurements and sample microstructural heterogeneities. Here, we report the direct visualization of halide anion interdiffusion in CsPbCl3–CsPbBr3 single crystalline perovskite nanowire heterojunctions using wide-field and confocal photoluminescence measurements. The combination of nanoscale imaging techniques with these single crystalline materials allows us to measure intrinsic anionic lattice diffusivities, free from complications of microscale inhomogeneity. Halide diffusivities were found to be between 10−13 and ∼10−12 cm2/second at about 100 °C, which are several orders of magnitudes lower than those reported in polycrystalline thin films. Spatially resolved photoluminescence lifetimes and surface potential measurements provide evidence of the central role of halide vacancies in facilitating ionic diffusion. Vacancy formation free energies computed from molecular simulation are small due to the easily deformable perovskite lattice, accounting for the high equilibrium vacancy concentration. Furthermore, molecular simulations suggest that ionic motion is facilitated by low-frequency lattice modes, resulting in low activation barriers for vacancy-mediated transport. This work elucidates the intrinsic solid-state ion diffusion mechanisms in this class of semisoft materials and offers guidelines for engineering materials with long-term stability in functional devices.",

        "abstract": "Since the realization that diffusion MRI can probe the microstructural organization and orientation of biological tissue in vivo and non‐invasively, a multitude of diffusion imaging methods have been developed and applied to study the living human brain. Diffusion tensor imaging was the first model to be widely adopted in clinical and neuroscience research, but it was also clear from the beginning that it suffered from limitations when mapping complex configurations, such as crossing fibres. In this review, we highlight the main steps that have led the field of diffusion imaging to move from the tensor model to the adoption of diffusion and fibre orientation density functions as a more effective way to describe the complexity of white matter organization within each brain voxel. Among several techniques, spherical deconvolution has emerged today as one of the main approaches to model multiple fibre orientations and for tractography applications. Here we illustrate the main concepts and the reasoning behind this technique, as well as the latest developments in the field. The final part of this review provides practical guidelines and recommendations on how to set up processing and acquisition protocols suitable for spherical deconvolution.",

For the CFD-driven training, the gene expression programming (GEP) method (Weatheritt & Sandberg, J. Comput. Phys., 325, 22-37 (2016)) uses RANS calculations in an integrated way to evaluate the fitness of candidate models. The resulting model, which is the one providing the most accurate CFD results at the end of the training process, is thus expected to show good performance in RANS calculations. To demonstrate the potential of this new approach, the CFD-driven machine learning is applied to develop a model for improved prediction of wake mixing in turbomachines. A new model is trained based on a high-pressure turbine training case with particular physical features. The developed model is shown to have a more compact functional form than models trained without CFD assistance. Furthermore, the trained model has been evaluated a posteriori for the training case and three additional test cases with different physical flow features, and the predicted wake mixing profiles are significantly improved in all cases. With the present framework, the model equation is explicitly given and available for analysis, thus it could be deduced that the enhanced wake prediction is due to the extra diffusion introduced by the CFD-driven model.",

A new compensating regular term is designed, which can perform anisotropic and isotropic diffusion in image denoising, thus making up for insufficient diffusion in the total variation model. The algorithm first uses local standard deviation to distinguish neighborhood types. Then, the anisotropic diffusion based on L1 norm plays the role of edge protection in the strong edge region. The anisotropic and the isotropic diffusion simultaneously exist in the smooth region, so that the weak textures can be protected while overcoming the “staircase effect” effectively. The simulation experiments show that this method can effectively improve the peak signal-to-noise ratio and obtain the higher structural similarity index and the shorter running time.",

A selection criterion is proposed based on the comparison of three characteristic times: relaxation time, diffusion time, and process time. Then, the most common experimental methods to investigate the hydrogel properties are summarized, along with the state-of-the-art of mathematical modelling, with reference to the mechanical and transport properties of hydrogels, with particular attention to the viscoelastic and poroelastic behaviours.

        "abstract": "Context. The formation of planetesimals in protoplanetary disks is not well-understood. Streaming instability is a promising mechanism to directly form planetesimals from pebble-sized particles, provided a high enough solids-to-gas ratio. However, local enhancements of the solids-to-gas ratio are difficult to realize in a smooth disk, which motivates the consideration of special disk locations such as the snowline – the radial distance from the star beyond which water can condense into solid ice. Aims. In this article we investigate the viability of planetesimal formation by streaming instability near the snowline due to water diffusion and condensation. We aim to identify under what disk conditions streaming instability can be triggered near the snowline. Methods. To this end, we adopt a viscous disk model, and numerically solve the transport equations for vapor and solids on a cylindrical, 1D grid. We take into account radial drift of solids, gas accretion on to the central star, and turbulent diffusion. We study the importance of the back-reaction of solids on the gas and of the radial variation of the mean molecular weight of the gas. Different designs for the structure of pebbles are investigated, varying in the number and size of silicate grains. We also introduce a semi-analytical model that we employ to obtain results for different disk model parameters. Results. We find that water diffusion and condensation can locally enhance the ice surface density by a factor 3–5 outside the snowline. Assuming that icy pebbles contain many micron-sized silicate grains that are released during evaporation, the enhancement is increased by another factor ~2. In this “many-seeds” model, the solids-to-gas ratio interior to the snowline is enhanced as well, but not as much as just outside the snowline. In the context of a viscous disk, the diffusion-condensation mechanism is most effective for high values of the turbulence parameter α (10 -3 –10 -2 ). Therefore, assuming young disks are more vigorously turbulent than older disks, planetesimals near the snowline can form in an early stage of the disk. In highly turbulent disks, tens of Earth masses can be stored in an annulus outside the snowline, which can be identified with recent ALMA observations.",

        "abstract": "The persistence of DNA over archaeological and paleontological timescales in diverse environments has led to revolutionary body of paleogenomic research, yet the dynamics of DNA degradation are still poorly understood. We analyzed 185 paleogenomic datasets and compared DNA survival with environmental variables and sample ages. We find cytosine deamination follows a conventional thermal age model, but we find no correlation between DNA fragmentation and sample age over the timespans analyzed, even when controlling for environmental variables. We propose a model for ancient DNA decay wherein fragmentation rapidly reaches a threshold, then subsequently slows. The observed loss of DNA over time is likely due to a bulk diffusion process, highlighting the importance of tissues and environments creating effectively closed systems for DNA preservation.",

The model captures the strategic behavior between competing firms, its effect on their innovation decisions, and the resulting “best-versus-the-rest” dynamics. We consider multiple potential mechanisms that can drive the observed changes and use the calibrated model to assess their relative importance, with particular attention to the implied transitional dynamics.

        "abstract": "In aqueous environments, hydrophobic organic contaminants are often associated with particles. Besides natural particles, microplastics have raised public concern. The release of pollutants from such particles depends on mass transfer, either in an aqueous boundary layer or by intraparticle diffusion. Which of these mechanisms controls the mass-transfer kinetics depends on partition coefficients, particle size, boundary conditions, and time. We have developed a semianalytical model accounting for both processes and performed batch experiments on the desorption kinetics of typical wastewater pollutants (phenanthrene, tonalide, and benzophenone) at different dissolved-organic-matter concentrations, which change the overall partitioning between microplastics and water. Initially, mass transfer is externally dominated, while finally, intraparticle diffusion controls release kinetics. Under boundary conditions typical for batch experiments (finite bath), desorption accelerates with increasing partition coefficients for intraparticle diffusion, while it becomes independent of partition coefficients if film diffusion prevails. On the contrary, under field conditions (infinite bath), the pollutant release controlled by intraparticle diffusion is not affected by partitioning of the compound while external mass transfer slows down with increasing sorption. Our results clearly demonstrate that sorption/desorption time scales observed in batch experiments may not be transferred to field conditions without an appropriate model accounting for both the mass-transfer mechanisms and the specific boundary conditions at hand.",

        "abstract": "To improve the efficiency of existing perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a detailed understanding of the underlying device physics during their operation is essential. Here, a device model has been developed and validated that describes the operation of PSCs and quantitatively explains the role of contacts, the electron and hole transport layers, charge generation, drift and diffusion of charge carriers and recombination. The simulation to the experimental data of vacuum‐deposited CH3NH3PbI3 solar cells over multiple thicknesses has been fit and the device behavior under different operating conditions has been studied to delineate the influence of the external bias, charge‐carrier mobilities, energetic barriers for charge injection/extraction and, different recombination channels on the solar cell performance. By doing so, a unique set of material parameters and physical processes that describe these solar cells is identified. Trap‐assisted recombination at material interfaces is the dominant recombination channel limiting device performance and passivation of traps increases the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these devices by 40%. Finally, guidelines to increase their performance have been issued and it is shown that a PCE beyond 25% is within reach.",

The model is developed relying on the 1-D Poisson equation and the drift-diffusion transport mechanism. The validity of the Maxwell–Boltzmann approximation is demonstrated in the limit to 0 K as a result of dopant freezeout in cryogenic equilibrium. Explicit MOS transistor expressions are then derived, including incomplete dopant ionization, bandgap widening, mobility reduction, and interface charge traps. The temperature dependence of the interface trapping process explains the discrepancy between the measured value of the subthreshold swing and the thermal limit at deep-cryogenic temperatures. The accuracy of the developed model is validated by experimental results on long devices of a commercial 28-nm bulk CMOS process. The proposed model provides the core expressions for the development of physically accurate compact models dedicated to low-temperature CMOS circuit simulation.",

        "abstract": "Simulating transport with cold atoms Much can be learned about the nature of a solid from how charge and spin propagate through it. Transport experiments can also be performed in quantum simulators such as cold atom systems, in which individual atoms can be imaged using quantum microscopes. Now, two groups have investigated transport in the so-called Fermi-Hubbard model using a two-dimensional optical lattice filled with one fermionic atom per site (see the Perspective by Brantut). Moving away from half-filling to enable charge transport, Brown et al. found that the resistivity had a linear temperature dependence, not unlike that seen in the strange metal phase of cuprate superconductors. In a complementary study on spin transport, Nichols et al. observed spin diffusion driven by superexchange coupling. Science, this issue p. 379, p. 383; see also p. 344 Atomic transport in a 2D optical lattice is investigated in the strongly interacting regime at or near half-filling. Strongly correlated materials are expected to feature unconventional transport properties, such that charge, spin, and heat conduction are potentially independent probes of the dynamics. In contrast to charge transport, the measurement of spin transport in such materials is highly challenging. We observed spin conduction and diffusion in a system of ultracold fermionic atoms that realizes the half-filled Fermi-Hubbard model. For strong interactions, spin diffusion is driven by super-exchange and doublon-hole–assisted tunneling, and strongly violates the quantum limit of charge diffusion. The technique developed in this work can be extended to finite doping, which can shed light on the complex interplay between spin and charge in the Hubbard model.",

For specific state spaces, we prove existence, uniqueness, and invariance properties of solutions of the corresponding stochastic convolution equations. Our arguments avoid infinite-dimensional stochastic analysis as well as stochastic integration with respect to non-semimartingales, relying instead on tools from the theory of finite-dimensional deterministic convolution equations.

The model, based on the solution-diffusion mechanism, was tested using experimental salt permeability data for a series of commercial ion exchange membranes. Equilibrium salt partition coefficients were calculated using a thermodynamic framework (i.e., Donnan theory), incorporating Manning's counterion condensation theory to calculate ion activity coefficients in the membrane phase and the Pitzer model to calculate ion activity coefficients in the solution phase. The model predicted NaCl partition coefficients in a cation exchange membrane and two anion exchange membranes, as well as MgCl2 partition coefficients in a cation exchange membrane, remarkably well at higher external salt concentrations (>0.1 M) and reasonably well at lower external salt concentrations (<0.1 M) with no adjustable parameters. Membrane ion diffusion coefficients were calculated using a combination of the Mackie and Meares model, which assumes ion diffusion in water-swollen polymers is affected by a tortuosity factor, and a model developed by Manning to account for electrostatic effects. Agreement between experimental and predicted salt diffusion coefficients was good with no adjustable parameters. Calculated salt partition and diffusion coefficients were combined within the framework of the solution-diffusion model to predict salt permeability coefficients. Agreement between model and experimental data was remarkably good. Additionally, a simplified version of the model was used to elucidate connections between membrane structure (e.g., fixed charge group concentration) and salt transport properties.",

        "abstract": "This work deals with a generalization of the minimum Target Set Selection (TSS) problem, a key algorithmic question in information diffusion research due to its potential commercial value. Firstly proposed by Kempe et al., the TSS problem is based on a linear threshold diffusion model defined on an input graph with node thresholds, quantifying the hardness to influence each node. The goal is to find the smaller set of items that can influence the whole network according to the diffusion model defined. This study generalizes the TSS problem on networks characterized by many-to-many relationships modeled via hypergraphs. Specifically, we introduce a linear threshold diffusion process on such structures, which evolves as follows. Let H=(V,E) be a hypergraph. At the beginning of the process, the nodes in a given set S⊆V are influenced. Then, at each iteration, (i) the influenced hyperedges set is augmented by all edges having a sufficiently large number of influenced nodes; (ii) consequently, the set of influenced nodes is enlarged by all the nodes having a sufficiently large number of already influenced hyperedges. The process ends when no new nodes can be influenced. Exploiting this diffusion model, we define the minimum Target Set Selection problem on hypergraphs (TSSH). Being the problem NP-hard (as it generalizes the TSS problem), we introduce four heuristics and provide an extensive evaluation on real-world networks.",

        "abstract": "Existing weakly supervised fine-grained image recognition (WFGIR) methods usually pick out the discriminative regions from the high-level feature maps directly. We discover that due to the operation of stacking local receptive filed, Convolutional Neural Network causes the discriminative region diffusion in high-level feature maps, which leads to inaccurate discriminative region localization. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Discriminative Feature-oriented Gaussian Mixture Model (DF-GMM), to address the problem of discriminative region diffusion and find better fine-grained details. Specifically, DF-GMM consists of 1) a low-rank representation mechanism (LRM), which learns a set of low-rank discriminative bases by Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in high-level semantic feature maps to improve discriminative ability of feature representation, 2) a low-rank representation reorganization mechanism (LR$ ^2 $M) which resumes the space information corresponding to low-rank discriminative bases to reconstruct the low-rank feature maps. It alleviates the discriminative region diffusion problem and locate discriminative regions more precisely. Extensive experiments verify that DF-GMM yields the best performance under the same settings with the most competitive approaches, in CUB-Bird, Stanford-Cars datasets, and FGVC Aircraft.",

        "abstract": "In the present paper, we are concerned with a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic reaction-diffusion model governed by a mass action infection mechanism and linear birth-death growth with no flux boundary condition. By performing qualitative analysis, we study the stability of the disease-free equilibrium, uniform persistence property in terms of the basic reproduction number and the global stability of the endemic equilibrium in a homogeneous environment, and investigate the asymptotic profile of endemic equilibria (when they exist) in a heterogeneous environment when the movement rate of the susceptible and infected populations is small. Our results, together with those in previous works on three other closely related modeling systems, suggest that factors such as infection mechanism, variation of total population, and population movement play vital but subtle roles in the transmission dynamics of diseases and hence provide useful insights into the strategies designed for disease control and preve...",

        "abstract": "Abstract The motivation and diffusion of language change have been modelled and discussed in frequently conflicting terms, often focused on an isolated set of features rather than more integrative sociolinguistic concerns. We present a case study of language change in Austrian German along a broad range of lexical, syntactic as well as textual features, approached through a corpus based on genres situated in the pertinent fields of news reporting, education and business. Based on our results, we argue that drawing on ‘genre’ as socially-situated, interactive and goal-oriented patterns of language use provides both a conceptual and empirical framework that may help address some of the more prominent issues in modelling language change: as a concept, it provides a frame within which to grasp the social changes driving language change; as empirical focus, it guides data selection and allows us to describe and explicate complex and seemingly contradictory diffusion patterns.",

        "abstract": "We present detailed studies of ionic conductivity in several polymerized ionic liquids (PolyILs) with different size of mobile ions. Presented analysis revealed that charge diffusion in PolyILs is about 10 times slower than ion diffusion, suggesting strong ion–ion correlations that reduce ionic conductivity. The activation energy for the ion diffusion shows a nonmonotonous dependence on the mobile ion size, indicating a competition between Coulombic and elastic forces controlling ion transport in PolyILs. The former dominates mobility of small ions (e.g., Li), while the latter controls mobility of large ions (e.g., TFSI). We propose a simple qualitative model describing the activation energy for the ion diffusion. It suggests that an increase in dielectric constant of PolyILs should lead to a significant enhancement of conductivity of small ions (e.g., Li and Na).",

With excellent surface reaction kinetics, these catalysts encounter CO2 mass transport limitations at current densities ca. 20 mA cm–2. We show here that – in addition to influencing reaction rates and local reactant concentration – the morphology of nanostructured electrodes enhances long-range CO2 transport via their influence on gas-evolution. Sharper needle morphologies can nucleate and release bubbles as small as 20 μm, leading to a 4-fold increase in the limiting current density compared to a nanoparticle-based catalyst alone. By extending this observation into a diffusion model that accounts for bubble-induced mass transport near the electrode’s surface, diffusive transport can be directly linked to current densities and operating conditions, identifying efficient routes to >100 mA cm–2 production.

        "abstract": "An inventor's own knowledge is a key input in the innovation process. This knowledge can be built by interacting with and learning from others. This paper uses a new large-scale panel dataset on European inventors matched to their employers and patents. We document key empirical facts on inventors' productivity over the life cycle, inventors' research teams, and interactions with other inventors. Among others, most patents are the result of collaborative work. Interactions with better inventors are very strongly correlated with higher subsequent productivity. These facts motivate the main ingredients of our new innovation-led endogenous growth model, in which innovations are produced by heterogeneous research teams of inventors using inventor knowledge. The evolution of an inventor's knowledge is explained through the lens of a diffusion model in which inventors can learn in two ways: By interacting with others at an endogenously chosen rate; and from an external, age-dependent source that captures alternative learning channels, such as learning-by-doing. Thus, our knowledge diffusion model nests inside the innovation-based endogenous growth model. We estimate the model, which fits the data very closely, and use it to perform several policy exercises, such as quantifying the large importance of interactions for growth, studying the effects of reducing interaction costs (e.g., through IT or infrastructure), and comparing the learning and innovation processes of different countries.",

        "abstract": "Communication of signals among nodes in a complex network poses fundamental problems of efficiency and cost. Routing of messages along shortest paths requires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion, which operates according to local topological features, is informationally “cheap” but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network communication that combines local and global information about the network topology to generate biased random walks on the network. The model generates a continuous spectrum of dynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion) communication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two cohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying the global information bias on the network’s communication cost. We identify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path communication process with a relatively small global information bias on the system’s dynamics. Moreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes varies as a function of the global information bias driving the system’s dynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject differences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework departs from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, unifying both models under a single family of dynamical processes that differ by the extent to which global information about the network topology influences the routing patterns of neural signals traversing the network.",

        "title": "Polyhedral meshing in numerical analysis of conjugate heat transfer",
        "abstract": "Computational methods have been widely applied in conjugate heat transfer analysis. The very first and crucial step in such research is the meshing process which consists in dividing the analysed geometry into numerous small control volumes (cells). In Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications it is desirable to use the hexahedral cells as the resulting mesh is characterized by low numerical diffusion. Unfortunately generating such mesh can be a very time-consuming task and in case of complicated geometry - it may not be possible to generate cells of good quality. Therefore tetrahedral cells have been implemented into commercial pre-processors. Their advantage is the ease of its generation even in case of very complex geometry. On the other hand tetrahedrons cannot be stretched excessively without decreasing the mesh quality factor, so significantly larger number of cells has to be used in comparison to hexahedral mesh in order to achieve a reasonable accuracy. Moreover the numerical diffusion of tetrahedral elements is significantly higher. Therefore the polyhedral cells are proposed within the paper in order to combine the advantages of hexahedrons (low numerical diffusion resulting in accurate solution) and tetrahedrons (rapid semi-automatic generation) as well as to overcome the disadvantages of both the above mentioned mesh types. The major benefit of polyhedral mesh is that each individual cell has many neighbours, so gradients can be well approximated. Polyhedrons are also less sensitive to stretching than tetrahedrons which results in better mesh quality leading to improved numerical stability of the model. In addition, numerical diffusion is reduced due to mass exchange over numerous faces. This leads to a more accurate solution achieved with a lower cell count. Therefore detailed comparison of numerical modelling results concerning conjugate heat transfer using tetrahedral and polyhedral meshes is presented in the paper.",

        "abstract": "Whilst extensive research has been conducted on the effects of temperature in lithium-ion batteries, mechanical effects have not received as much attention despite their importance. In this work, the stress response in electrode particles is investigated through a pseudo-2D model with mechanically coupled diffusion physics. This model can predict the voltage, temperature and thickness change for a lithium cobalt oxide-graphite pouch cell agreeing well with experimental results. Simulations show that the stress level is overestimated by up to 50% using the standard pseudo-2D model (without stress enhanced diffusion), and stresses can accelerate the diffusion in solid phases and increase the discharge cell capacity by 5.4%. The evolution of stresses inside electrode particles and the stress inhomogeneity through the battery electrode have been illustrated. The stress level is determined by the gradients of lithium concentration, and large stresses are generated at the electrode-separator interface when high C-rates are applied, e.g. fast charging. The results can explain the experimental results of particle fragmentation close to the separator and provide novel insights to understand the local aging behaviors of battery cells and to inform improved battery control algorithms for longer lifetimes. © The Author(s) 2019.

        "abstract": "It has recently been proposed that subsurface oxygen is crucial for the adsorption and subsequent electroreduction of CO2 on copper. Using density functional theory, we have studied the stability and diffusion of subsurface oxygen in single crystals of copper exposing (111) and (100) facets. Oxygen is at least 1.5 eV more stable on the surface than beneath it for both crystal orientations; interstitial sites are too small to accommodate oxygen. The rate of atomic oxygen diffusion from one layer below a Cu(111) surface to the surface is 5 × 103 s-1. Oxygen can survive longer in deeper layers, but it does not promote CO2 adsorption there. Diffusion of subsurface oxygen is easier to the less-dense Cu(100) surface, even from lower layers (rate ≈ 1 × 107 s-1). Once the applied voltage and dispersion forces are properly modeled, we find that subsurface oxygen is unnecessary for CO2 adsorption on copper.",

        "abstract": "In lipid dispersions, the ability of reactants to move from one lipid particle to another is an important, yet often ignored, determinant of lipid oxidation and its inhibition by antioxidants. This review describes three putative interparticle transfer mechanisms for oxidants and antioxidants: (a) diffusion, (b) collision-exchange-separation, and (c) micelle-assisted transfer. Mechanism a involves the diffusion of molecules from one particle to another through the intervening aqueous phase. Mechanism b involves the transfer of molecules from one particle to another when the particles collide with each other. Mechanism c involves the solubilization of molecules in micelles within the aqueous phase and then their transfer between particles. During lipid oxidation, the accumulation of surface-active lipid hydroperoxides (LOOHs) beyond their critical micelle concentration may shift their mass transport from the collision-exchange-separation pathway (slow transfer) to the micelle-assisted mechanism (fast transfer), which may account for the transition from the initiation to the propagation phase. Similarly, the cut-off effect governing antioxidant activity in lipid dispersions may be due to the fact that above a certain hydrophobicity, the transfer mechanism for antioxidants changes from diffusion to collision-exchange-separation. This hypothesis provides a simple model to rationalize the design and formulation of antioxidants and dispersed lipids.",

        "abstract": "Rapid motion of electrolyte ions is a crucial requirement to ensure the fast charging/discharging and the high power densities of supercapacitor devices. This motion is primarily determined by the pore size and connectivity of the used porous carbon electrodes. Here, the diffusion characteristics of each individual electrolyte component, that is, anion, cation, and solvent confined to model carbons with uniform and well‐defined pore sizes are quantified. As a result, the contributions of micropores, mesopores, and hierarchical pore architectures to the overall transport of adsorbed mobile species are rationalized. Unexpectedly, it is observed that the presence of a network of mesopores, in addition to smaller micropores—the concept widely used in heterogeneous catalysis to promote diffusion of sorbates—does not necessarily enhance ionic transport in carbon materials. The observed phenomenon is explained by the stripping off the surrounding solvent shell from the electrolyte ions entering the micropores of the hierarchical material, and the resulting enrichment of solvent molecules preferably in the mesopores. It is believed that the presented findings serve to provide fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of electrolyte diffusion in carbon materials and depict a quantitative platform for the future designing of supercapacitor electrodes on a rational basis.",

        "abstract": "The environment of a CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER) catalyst is intimately coupled with the surface reaction energetics and is therefore a critical aspect of the overall system performance. The immediate reaction environment of the electrocatalyst constitutes the electrical double layer (EDL) which extends a few nanometers into the electrolyte and screens the surface charge density. In this study, we resolve the species concentrations and potential profiles in the EDL of a CO2ER system by self-consistently solving the migration, diffusion and reaction phenomena using the generalized modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck (GMPNP) equations which include the effect of volume exclusion due to the solvated size of solution species. We demonstrate that the concentration of solvated cations builds at the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) with increasing applied potential until the steric limit is reached. The formation of the EDL is expected to have important consequences for the transport of the CO2 molecule to the catalyst surface. The electric field in the EDL diminishes the pH in the first 5 nm from the OHP, with an accumulation of protons and a concomitant depletion of hydroxide ions. This is a considerable departure from the results obtained using reaction-diffusion models where migration is ignored. Finally, we use the GMPNP model to compare the nature of the EDL for different alkali metal cations to show the effect of solvated size and polarization of water on the resultant electric field. Our results establish the significance of the EDL and electrostatic forces in defining the local reaction environment of CO2 electrocatalysts.",

Guided by probability intuitions and the stochastic perspectives of anomalous diffusion, we show the reasonable ways, ensuring the clear physical meaning and well-posedness of the partial differential equations (PDEs), of specifying “boundary” conditions for space fractional PDEs modeling the anomalous diffusion. Some properties of the operators are discussed, and the well-posednesses of the PDEs with generalized boundary conditions are proved.",

After introducing the sheaf model, we develop a sheaf Laplacian in this context and show how to evolve both opinions and communications with diffusion dynamics over the network.

        "abstract": "Various MRI sequences have shown their potential to discriminate parotid gland tumors, including but not limited to T2‐weighted, postcontrast T1‐weighted, and diffusion‐weighted images. In this study, we present a fully automatic system for the diagnosis of parotid gland tumors by using deep learning methods trained on multimodal MRI images. We used a two‐dimensional convolution neural network, U‐Net, to segment and classify parotid gland tumors. The U‐Net model was trained with transfer learning, and a specific design of the batch distribution optimized the model accuracy. We also selected five combinations of MRI contrasts as the input data of the neural network and compared the classification accuracy of parotid gland tumors. The results indicated that the deep learning model with diffusion‐related parameters performed better than those with structural MR images. The performance results (n = 85) of the diffusion‐based model were as follows: accuracy of 0.81, 0.76, and 0.71, sensitivity of 0.83, 0.63, and 0.33, and specificity of 0.80, 0.84, and 0.87 for Warthin tumors, pleomorphic adenomas, and malignant tumors, respectively. Combining diffusion‐weighted and contrast‐enhanced T1‐weighted images did not improve the prediction accuracy. In summary, the proposed deep learning model could classify Warthin tumor and pleomorphic adenoma tumor but not malignant tumor.",

        "abstract": "Understanding of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of electrode materials is of great importance to develop new materials for high performance rechargeable batteries. Compared with computational understanding of physical and chemical properties of electrode materials, experimental methods provide direct and convenient evaluation of these properties. Often, the information gained from experimental work can not only offer feedback for the computational methods but also provide useful insights for improving the performance of materials. However, accurate experimental quantification of some properties can still be challenging. Among them, chemical diffusion coefficient is one representative example. It is one of the most crucial parameters determining the kinetics of intercalation compounds, which are by far the dominant electrode type used in rechargeable batteries. Therefore, it is of significance to quantitatively evaluate this parameter. For this purpose, various electrochemical techniques have been invented, for example, galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), potentiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). One salient advantage of these electrochemical techniques over other characterization techniques is that some implicit thermodynamic and kinetic quantities can be linked with the readily measurable electrical signals, current, and voltage, with very high precision. Nevertheless, proper application of these techniques requires not just an understanding of the structure and chemistry of the studied materials but sufficient knowledge of the physical model for ion transport within solid host materials and the analysis method to solve for chemical diffusion coefficient. Our group has been focusing on using various electrochemical techniques to investigate battery materials, as well as developing models for studying some emerging materials. In this Account, the principles of the aforementioned four electrochemical techniques and the corresponding analytical equations for calculating the chemical diffusion coefficients are first briefly summarized, followed by a discussion of the hidden assumptions for deriving these analytical equations and the resulting limitations in their implementation. To address these limitations, various corrections have been made in the literature. Nevertheless, the phase transition behavior, which is the typical feature for many intercalation materials, is barely considered. Here we retrospect our previous work on developing a two-phase model for describing the phase transition behavior of some intercalation compounds and discuss how to obtain the chemical diffusion coefficients based on the model, using LiFePO4 as an example material. After that, we have a discussion on the methodology for using electrochemical techniques to investigate new material features. It is our hope that this Account can serve as a call for more endeavors into the development of novel electrochemical tools for battery research.",

Both SEI thickness and morphology are predicted by our model as we take into account two transport mechanisms, i.e., solvent diffusion in the SEI pores and charge transport in the solid SEI phase. We show that a porous SEI is created due to the interplay of these transport mechanisms. Different dual layer SEIs emerge from different electrolyte decomposition reactions. We reveal the behavior of such dual layer structures and discuss its dependence on system parameters. Model analysis enables us to interpret SEI thickness fluctuations and link them to the rate-limiting transport mechanism. Our results are general and independent of specific modeling choices, e.g., for charge transport and reduction reactions.",

This paper investigates whether it is possible to improve out-of-sample predictions by changing two aspects of the canonical approach: 1) Using response times in addition to the choice data, and 2) Combining them using a model from the psychology and neuroscience literature, the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM). Two experiments compare the out-of-sample choice prediction accuracies of both methods and in both cases the DDM method outperforms a logistic prediction method. Furthermore, the DDM allows for out-of-sample process predictions. Both experiments validate the DDM as a method for predicting out-of-sample response times.",

With Neumann boundary condition, the crossing curve that separates the stable and unstable regions of the equilibrium may consist of two components, where spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous periodic solutions are generated through Hopf bifurcation respectively. This phenomenon rarely emerges from standard partial functional differential equations with Neumann boundary condition, which indicates that the memory-based diffusion can induce more complicated spatiotemporal dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) catalyze a reaction fundamental for life: the bidirectional conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into bicarbonate (HCO3−) and protons (H+). These enzymes impact numerous physiological processes that occur within and across the many compartments in the body. Within compartments, CAs promote rapid H+ buffering and thus the stability of pH-sensitive processes. Between compartments, CAs promote movements of H+, CO2, HCO3−, and related species. This traffic is central to respiration, digestion, and whole-body/cellular pH regulation. Here, we focus on the role of mathematical modeling in understanding how CA enhances buffering as well as gradients that drive fluxes of CO2 and other solutes (facilitated diffusion). We also examine urinary acid secretion and the carriage of CO2 by the respiratory system. We propose that the broad physiological impact of CAs stem from three fundamental actions: promoting H+ buffering, enhancing H+ exchange between buffer systems, and facilitating diffusion. Mathematical modeling can be a powerful tool for: (1) clarifying the complex interdependencies among reaction, diffusion, and protein-mediated components of physiological processes; (2) formulating hypotheses and making predictions to be tested in wet-lab experiments; and (3) inferring data that are impossible to measure.",

The presented system integrates both clinical biomarkers (prostate-specific antigen) and extracted features from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging collected at multiple b values. The presented system performs 3 major processing steps. First, prostate delineation using a hybrid approach that combines a level-set model with nonnegative matrix factorization. Second, estimation and normalization of diffusion parameters, which are the apparent diffusion coefficients of the delineated prostate volumes at different b values followed by refinement of those apparent diffusion coefficients using a generalized Gaussian Markov random field model. Then, construction of the cumulative distribution functions of the processed apparent diffusion coefficients at multiple b values. In parallel, a K-nearest neighbor classifier is employed to transform the prostate-specific antigen results into diagnostic probabilities. Finally, those prostate-specific antigen–based probabilities are integrated with the initial diagnostic probabilities obtained using stacked nonnegativity constraint sparse autoencoders that employ apparent diffusion coefficient–cumulative distribution functions for better diagnostic accuracy. Experiments conducted on 18 diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data sets achieved 94.4% diagnosis accuracy (sensitivity = 88.9% and specificity = 100%), which indicate the promising results of the presented computer-aided diagnostic system.",

The AAI is allowed to purchase excess-of-loss reinsurance and invest her surplus in a risk-free asset and a risky asset whose price is described by a jump-diffusion model. Under the criterion for maximizing the expected exponential utility of terminal wealth, optimal strategy and optimal value function are derived by applying the stochastic dynamic programming approach.

        "abstract": "Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) is a technology that allows the separation of CO2 , which is generated by the combustion of fossil fuels. The majority of process designs currently under investigation are systems of coupled fluidized beds. Advances in the development of power generation system using CLC cannot be introduced without using numerical modelling as a research tool. The primary and critical activity in numerical modelling is the computational domain discretization. It influences the numerical diffusion as well as convergence of the model and therefore the overall accuracy of the obtained results. Hence an innovative approach of computational domain discretization using polyhedral (POLY) mesh is proposed in the paper. This method reduces both the numerical diffusion of the mesh as well as the time cost of preparing the model for subsequent calculation. The major advantage of POLY mesh is that each individual cell has many neighbours, so gradients can be much better approximated in comparison to commonly-used tetrahedral (TET) mesh. POLYs are also less sensitive to stretching than TETs which results in better numerical stability of the model. Therefore detailed comparison of numerical modelling results concerning subsection of CLC system using tetrahedral and polyhedral mesh is covered in the paper.",

        "abstract": "The framework for pit stability established in Part II of this series is elaborated upon and expanded. The maximum pit dissolution current density, i diff,max , which depends on temperature and maximum potential at the pit surface in a given pit environment, is proposed and compared with the diffusion current density to determine the conditions for pit stability and salt ﬁlm formation. For an open pit, the criterion for pit stability is that i diss,max must be greater than or equal to the critical diffusion current density required for maintaining a critical local environment for active dissolution, i diff,crit . The critical condition of i diss,max = i diff,crit is associated with three parameters that must be exceeded for stabilization of an open pit: critical temperature T crit , critical potential E crit and critical pit depth r crit . Analogously, the criterion for salt ﬁlm formation is i diss,max must further exceed the diffusion-limited current density i lim , and three parameters associated with salt ﬁlm formation are: saturation temperature T sat , saturation potential E sat and saturation pit depth r sat . Unifying criteria for control of pit growth by charge transfer or diffusion are proposed, which provide interrelationships for all principle parameters. The pit stability criteria for covered pits, such as metastable pits, are also described. The relative importance of passive ﬁlm breakdown and pit growth stability in pitting corrosion has been debated over the last few decades. Recently, the authors of this paper proposed a new per- spective on the critical step of pitting by suggesting that pit growth stability controls pitting corrosion under aggressive conditions, i.e. harsh electrolytes and extreme environments and/or susceptible mi-crostructures, while passive ﬁlm breakdown is more likely the critical factor in less extreme environments and/or for less susceptible alloys. 1 this perspective, a conceptual model for the critical pitting temperature (CPT), which considers both pit growth stability and passive ﬁlm breakdown, was proposed. The model able to explain various aspects of CPT, that could not be explained by previous models, why CPT measurements can exhibit a distribution of values and why the CPT of an alloy can depend on a variety of factors such as surface treatments and the chloride concentration of bulk solution. To establish the model, a new framework for pit growth stability was presented by considering both dissolution and diffusion inside the pit to maintain a sufﬁciently aggressive local environment required for active dissolution.",

Given that self-relevant information is prioritized during various stages of processing, here we hypothesized that self-association may privilege access to awareness under continuous flash suppression (CFS). The results supported this prediction. Compared with geometric shapes referenced to either a friend or stranger, those previously associated with self were prioritized in visual awareness. To establish the basis of this effect, the processes underlying task performance were investigated using a hierarchical drift diffusion model approach. These analyses showed that self-prioritization mapped onto both the decisional (i.e., starting value, z) and nondecisional (i.e., t0) parameters of the diffusion model.

Integrating the diffusion coefficient across the temperature history with respect to time provided the total diffusion used to predict the bond strength, which was compared to the measured bond strength of hollow acrylonitrile butadiene styr (ABS) boxes printed at various processing conditions. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe simulated bond strengths predicted the measured bond strengths with a coefficient of determination of 0.795.

        "abstract": "Intertidal mussels can self-organize into periodic spot, stripe, labyrinth, and gap patterns ranging from centimeter to meter scales. The leading mathematical explanations for these phenomena are the reaction-diffusion-advection model and the phase separation model. This paper continues the series studies on analytically understanding the existence of pattern solutions in the reaction-diffusion mussel-algae model. The stability of the positive constant steady state and the existence of Hopf and steady-state bifurcations are studied by analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation. Furthermore, we focus on the Turing-Hopf (TH) bifurcation and obtain the explicit dynamical classification in its neighborhood by calculating and investigating the normal form on the center manifold. Using theoretical and numerical simulations, we demonstrates that this TH interaction would significantly enhance the diversity of spatial patterns and trigger the alternative paths for the pattern development.",

They were used as adsorbents for the removal of methylene blue dye from aqueous solution, and the adsorption equilibrium and kinetics were studied via batch adsorption experiments and the adsorption mechanisms were investigated. Results showed that the equilibrium data for methylene blue adsorption onto VACFF-1300 and VACFF-1600 fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm model, with maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of 256.1 mg/g and 325.8 mg/g, respectively. Besides, the adsorption kinetics study showed that the adsorption of methylene blue onto the two VACFF samples could be best described by the pseudo second-order model. Moreover, the intraparticle diffusion modelling showed that intraparticle diffusion is rate-controlling for both VACFF-1300 and VACFF-1600, and external diffusion is also a rate-controlling step for the latter.",

        "abstract": "The human placenta plays a key role in reproduction and serves as a major interface for maternofetal exchange of nutrients. Study of human placenta pathology presents a great experimental challenge because it is not easily accessible. In this paper, a 3D placenta-on-a-chip model is developed by bioengineering techniques to simulate the placental interface between maternal and fetal blood in vitro. In this model, trophoblasts cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells are cultured on the opposite sides of a porous polycarbonate membrane, which is sandwiched between two microfluidic channels. Glucose diffusion across this barrier is analyzed under shear flow conditions. Meanwhile, a numerical model of the 3D placenta-on-a-chip model is developed. Numerical results of concentration distributions and the convection–diffusion mass transport is compared to the results obtained from the experiments for validation. Finally, effects of flow rate and membrane porosity on glucose diffusion across the placental barrier are studied using the validated numerical model. The placental model developed here provides a potentially helpful tool to study a variety of other processes at the maternal–fetal interface, for example, effects of drugs or infections like malaria on transport of various substances across the placental barrier.",

        "abstract": "Multivalent ion batteries (MVIBs) provide an inexpensive and energy-dense alternative to Li-ion batteries when portability of the battery is not of primary concern. However, it is difficult to find cathode materials that provide optimal battery characteristics such as energy density, adequate charge/discharge rates, and cyclability when paired with a multivalent ion. To address this, we investigate six MnO2 polymorphs as cathodes for MVIBs using density functional theory calculations. We find voltages as high as 3.7, 2.4, 2.7, 1.8, and 1.0 V for Li, Mg, Ca, Al, and Zn, respectively, and calculate the volume change due to intercalation. We then focus specifically on Ca and compute the energy barriers which are associated with the diffusion of the ion throughout the materials. Our findings show that the α-phase displays the most rapid diffusion kinetics for a Ca ion, with a diffusion barrier as low as 190 meV. We then investigate the potential for the five polymorphs exhibiting the highest voltage to interc...",

        "abstract": "When a liquid film of a colloidal solution consisting of particles of different sizes is dried on a substrate, the colloids often stratify, where smaller colloids are laid upon larger colloids. This phenomenon is counterintuitive because larger colloids which have a smaller diffusion constant, are expected to remain near the surface during the drying process, leaving a layer of larger colloids on top of smaller colloids. Here we show that the phenomenon is caused by the interaction between the colloids, and can be explained by a diffusion model accounting for the interaction between the colloids. By studying the evolution equations both numerically and analytically, we derive the condition at which the stratified structures are obtained.",

        "abstract": "Complex physical dynamics can often be modeled as a Markov jump process between mesoscopic configurations. When jumps between mesoscopic states are mediated by thermodynamic reservoirs, the time-irreversibility of the jump process is a measure of the physical dissipation. We rederive a recently introduced inequality relating the dissipation rate to current fluctuations in jump processes. We then adapt these results to diffusion processes via a limiting procedure, reaffirming that diffusions saturate the inequality. Finally, we study the impact of spatial coarse-graining in a two-dimensional model with driven diffusion. By observing fluctuations in coarse-grained currents, it is possible to infer a lower bound on the total dissipation rate, including the dissipation associated with hidden dynamics. The tightness of this bound depends on how well the spatial coarse-graining detects dynamical events that are driven by large thermodynamic forces.",

The optimal length of water baffle and other parameters of the proposed designs were determined. A validated 3D PEMFC performance model was adopted to assess the new designs. The results suggest that these 2 designs can improve PEMFC performance as to 9% when operating at the high current density because of the significant enhancement of mass transfer induced by air baffles.",

We first study the existence of the spatially inhomogeneous steady state. By analyzing the associated characteristic equation, we obtain sufficient conditions for local stability and Hopf bifurcation of this inhomogeneous steady state, respectively. For the Hopf bifurcation analysis, a geometric method and prior estimation techniques are combined to find all bifurcation values because the characteristic equation includes a non-self-adjoint operator and two time delays. In addition, we provide an explicit formula to determine the crossing direction of the purely imaginary eigenvalues. The bifurcation analysis reveals that the diffusion with memory effect could induce spatiotemporal patterns which were never possessed by an equation without memory-based diffusion. Furthermore, these patterns are different from the ones of a spatial memory equation with Neumann boundary condition.",

Although lattice diffusion is frozen out on the MD timescale, the accelerated GB diffusion provides enough atomic mobility to allow the segregated atoms to follow the moving GB. This finding opens the possibility of studying the solute drag effect with atomic precision using the MD approach. We demonstrate that a moving GB activates diffusion and alters the short-range order in the lattice regions swept during its motion. It is also shown that a moving GB drags an atmosphere of non-equilibrium vacancies, which accelerate diffusion in surrounding lattice regions.",
