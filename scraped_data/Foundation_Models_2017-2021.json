        "abstract": "AI is undergoing a paradigm shift with the rise of models (e.g., BERT, DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics, reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation, theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution, as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models, we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their fundamentally sociotechnical nature.",

        "abstract": "Pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models can be easily adapted to a variety of downstream language tasks. This significantly accelerates the development of language models. However, NLP models have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where a pre-defined trigger word in the input text causes model misprediction. Previous NLP backdoor attacks mainly focus on some specific tasks. This makes those attacks less general and applicable to other kinds of NLP models and tasks. In this work, we propose \\Name, the first task-agnostic backdoor attack against the pre-trained NLP models. The key feature of our attack is that the adversary does not need prior information about the downstream tasks when implanting the backdoor to the pre-trained model. When this malicious model is released, any downstream models transferred from it will also inherit the backdoor, even after the extensive transfer learning process. We further design a simple yet effective strategy to bypass a state-of-the-art defense. Experimental results indicate that our approach can compromise a wide range of downstream NLP tasks in an effective and stealthy way.",

Such models, recently coined as foundation models, have been transformational to the field of natural language processing. While similar models have also been trained on large corpuses of images, they are not well suited for remote sensing data. To stimulate the development of foundation models for Earth monitoring, we propose to develop a new benchmark comprised of a variety of downstream tasks related to climate change. We believe that this can lead to substantial improvements in many existing applications and facilitate the development of new applications.

Although the name is new (and contested (Field, 2021)), the term describes existing types of algorithmic models that are\"trained on broad data at scale\"and\"fine-tuned\"(i.e., adapted) for particular downstream tasks, and is intended to encompass large language models such as BERT or GPT-3 and computer vision models such as CLIP. Such technologies have the potential for harm broadly speaking (e.g., Bender et al., 2021), but their use in the educational domain is particularly fraught, despite the potential benefits for learners claimed by the authors. In section 3.3 of the Stanford report, Malik et al. argue that achieving the goal of providing education for all learners requires more efficient computational approaches that can rapidly scale across educational domains and across educational contexts, for which they argue foundation models are uniquely well-suited. However, evidence suggests that not only are foundation models not likely to achieve the stated benefits for learners, but their use may also introduce new risks for harm.",

        "abstract": "Foundation models--such as GPT, CLIP, and DINO--have achieved revolutionary progress in the past several years and are commonly believed to be a promising approach for general-purpose AI. In particular, self-supervised learning is adopted to pre-train a foundation model using a large amount of unlabeled data. A pre-trained foundation model is like an ``operating system'' of the AI ecosystem. Specifically, a foundation model can be used as a feature extractor for many downstream tasks with little or no labeled training data. Existing studies on foundation models mainly focused on pre-training a better foundation model to improve its performance on downstream tasks in non-adversarial settings, leaving its security and privacy in adversarial settings largely unexplored. A security or privacy issue of a pre-trained foundation model leads to a single point of failure for the AI ecosystem. In this book chapter, we discuss 10 basic security and privacy problems for the pre-trained foundation models, including six confidentiality problems, three integrity problems, and one availability problem. For each problem, we discuss potential opportunities and challenges. We hope our book chapter will inspire future research on the security and privacy of foundation models.",

        "abstract": "\n Due to the complex nature of the loads on Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs), accurate and optimized design of these structures require integrated simulation tools that can properly capture the various structural interactions governing the response. Considerable progress has been made in recent years on developing proper models for coupled aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads together with advanced control systems for turbines. These efforts have resulted in a suite of aero-servo-hydro-elastic numerical simulation codes available to the industry. However, proper foundation models have been lagging behind in these tools despite availability of various advanced nonlinear models for foundations in general. This has led to uneconomical design of OWTs that have consistently failed to reproduce the measured natural frequencies and can negatively affect the design and structural performance of OWTs.\n This paper presents a library of recently developed foundation models based on the theory of plasticity together with their verification against large-scale field test data. These models are cast in the framework of macro-elements that represent the nonlinear response of the soil-foundation system due to arbitrary coupled loads at the seabed. The paper also presents results of the numerical simulations of the dynamic response of a monopile-based OWT in the North Sea using an aero-servo-hydro-elastic code and comparison with the data collected from one of the instrumented OWTs in the field. It is further presented how the characteristics of the measured dynamic response change with loading over a long period and the way the response characteristics relate to the basic features of the developed models.",

        "title": "On the Suitability of Elastic Foundation Models",
        "abstract": "Elastic foundation models are extensively used to idealize the track substructure beneath the rail beam. These models, at the cost of certain simplifications, offer the advantage of being computationally inexpensive and are thus more likely to be used in engineering practice. This paper investigates the suitability of the elastic foundation models for predicting the deflection response of the rail track systems subjected to motion induced dynamic loading. A generalized track model which incorporates the effects of all essential structural and substructural track components-sleepers, rail-pads, ballast, and sub-ballast-is considered. Two different approaches are followed to model the subgrade. In the first approach, the subgrade layer is modeled using a viscoelastic element whose stiffness is derived from the properties of the underlying soil medium. A time domain deflection analysis of this so-called elastic foundation model is subsequently carried out to evaluate the rail beam deflections under the moving train loads. In the second approach, the soil medium beneath the track model is modeled as a semi-infinite elastic media. For this case, the deflection results are obtained in the time domain using a numerically stable, wavenumber based analytical approach. The rail beam deflections for both the models are evaluated for different train velocities using the track parameters associated with the high-speed railway line along two different sites for which data is available in the open literature: (a) a soft soil site in Sweden and (b) a stiff soil site in Portugal. The results show the comparisons of rail beam deflections obtained from the considered track models with the experimental data recorded at these sites. It is found that at lower train velocities (70-120 kmph) both models adequately capture the gross rail-track behavior at both sites. Further, at higher train velocities (180-220 kmph), the elastic foundation model shows reasonable agreement with the measured deflection values for stiff soil site, however, underestimates the deflections observed at the soft soil site. On the other hand, deflection results of the model comprising the semi-infinite elastic media are seen similar to the experimentally observed profile for both the sites. The underestimation in the deflection magnitudes in case of elastic foundation model may be attributed to the inability of the constituent viscoelastic element to consider the inertiaand wave-propagation related effects associated with the soil medium. The semi-infinite elastic ∗Speaker †Corresponding author: aditi.iitkmail@gmail.com sciencesconf.org:emilyon2019:261438 media, on the other hand, is capable of incorporating those effects of the soil medium and thus, captures the deflection behavior even at higher train velocities. It is additionally shown that in general the magnitude of the experimental value of the critical velocity in the case of the soft soil site is appreciably lower (due to the associated lower wave propagation velocity) than that predicted by the elastic foundation model. However, at the ‘rock-type’ sites, these pair of velocities may be of comparable magnitude, and thus, the elastic foundation model may prove suitable in these circumstances.",

        "abstract": "\n The concept of macro-element modelling – which was first introduced almost 30 years ago – has proven to be a convenient and accurate technique for modelling offshore foundations, but historically these models have mainly been used for academic purposes. Recent developments in foundation modelling now allow for application of such models in engineering practise and design. One such example is the family of new macro-element models that have been developed in the research project REDWIN to represent the foundation behaviour in dynamic analyses of Offshore Wind Turbines (OWTs). These models exhibit characteristic foundation behaviour such as nonlinearity, coupling of the load from different load components and hysteretic load dependent damping.\n This paper presents two of the REDWIN models, one applicable for monopile foundations and one for skirted suction caisson foundations. Use of the models are demonstrated through two practical problems that reflect typical design analyses of OWTs: the first example shows a fatigue damage assessment for a monopile, and the second considers an extreme load event for a suction bucket jacket. The structural response is computed using the REDWIN foundation models and compared with the response based on distributed API p-y springs for the monopile and clamped legs at seabed for the jacket. Special emphasis is devoted to how the model input is obtained to guide readers on practical use of the models.",

Moreover, adapting to the task’s unlabeled data (task-adaptive pretraining) improves performance even after domain-adaptive pretraining. Finally, we show that adapting to a task corpus augmented using simple data selection strategies is an effective alternative, especially when resources for domain-adaptive pretraining might be unavailable. Overall, we consistently find that multi-phase adaptive pretraining offers large gains in task performance.",

Computer vision foundation models, which are trained on diverse, large-scale dataset and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks, are critical for this mission to solve real-world computer vision applications. While existing vision foundation models such as CLIP, ALIGN, and Wu Dao 2.0 focus mainly on mapping images and textual representations to a cross-modal shared representation, we introduce a new computer vision foundation model, Florence, to expand the representations from coarse (scene) to fine (object), from static (images) to dynamic (videos), and from RGB to multiple modalities (caption, depth). By incorporating universal visual-language representations from Web-scale image-text data, our Florence model can be easily adapted for various computer vision tasks, such as classification, retrieval, object detection, VQA, image caption, video retrieval and action recognition. Moreover, Florence demonstrates outstanding performance in many types of transfer learning: fully sampled fine-tuning, linear probing, few-shot transfer and zero-shot transfer for novel images and objects. All of these properties are critical for our vision foundation model to serve general purpose vision tasks. Florence achieves new state-of-the-art results in majority of 44 representative benchmarks, e.g., ImageNet-1K zero-shot classification with top-1 accuracy of 83.74 and the top-5 accuracy of 97.18, 62.4 mAP on COCO fine tuning, 80.36 on VQA, and 87.8 on Kinetics-600.",

        "abstract": "Previous geo-referencing approaches for building information modeling (BIM) models can be problematic due to: (a) the different interpretations of the term ‘geo-referencing’, (b) the insufficient consideration of the placement hierarchy of the industry foundation classes (IFCs), and (c) the misunderstanding that a common way to embed spatial reference information for IFC is absent. Therefore, the objective of this study is to (1) clarify the meaning of geo-referencing in the context of BIM/GIS data integration, and (2) develop a common geo-referencing approach for IFC. To achieve the goal, a systematic and thorough investigation into the IFC standard was conducted to assess the geo-referencing capability of IFC. Based on the investigation, a geo-referencing approach was established using IFC entities that are common in different IFC versions, which makes the proposed approach common to IFC. Such a geo-referencing approach supports automatic geo-referencing that would facilitate the use of BIM models in GIS, e.g., for the construction of digital twins.",

Although outcomes for individuals with CF continue to improve, it remains a life-limiting condition with no cure. Individuals with CF manage extensive symptom and treatment burdens and face complex medical decisions throughout the illness course. Although palliative care has been shown to reduce suffering by alleviating illness-related burdens for people with serious illness and their families, little is known regarding the components and structure of various delivery models of palliative care needed to improve outcomes for people affected by CF. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) assembled an expert panel of clinicians, researchers, individuals with CF, and family caregivers, to develop consensus recommendations for models of best practices for palliative care in CF. Eleven statements were developed based on a systematic literature review and expert opinion, and address primary palliative care, specialty palliative care, and screening for palliative needs. These recommendations are intended to comprehensively address palliative care needs and improve quality of life for individuals with CF at all stages of illness and development, and their caregivers.",

A quasi-3D higher shear deformation theory is used that contains undetermined integral forms and involves only four unknowns to derive. The FG plates are supposed simply supported with temperature-dependent material properties and subjected to nonlinear temperature rise. Various homogenization models are used to estimate the effective material properties such as temperature-dependent thermoelastic properties. Equations of motion are derived from the principle of virtual displacements and Navier\\'s solution is used to solve the problem of simply supported plates. Numerical results for deflections and stresses of FG plate with temperature-dependent material properties are investigated. It can be concluded that the proposed theory is accurate and simple in solving the thermoelastic bending behavior of FG thick plates.",

To this end, we use diffusion probabilistic models, a class of latent variable models closely connected to score matching and energy-based methods. Our model learns gradients by optimizing a variational bound on the data likelihood and at inference time converts white noise into a sample of the distribution of interest through a Markov chain using Langevin sampling. We demonstrate experimentally that the proposed autoregressive denoising diffusion model is the new state-of-the-art multivariate probabilistic forecasting method on real-world data sets with thousands of correlated dimensions.

A scientific workshop organized by the National Kidney Foundation was held in September 2016 to review current evidence. Cell culture studies and animal models suggest that elevated serum urate concentrations can contribute to kidney disease, hypertension, and metabolic syndrome. Epidemiologic evidence also supports elevated serum urate concentrations as a risk factor for the development of kidney disease, hypertension, and diabetes, but differences in methodologies and inpacts on serum urate concentrations by even subtle changes in kidney function render conclusions uncertain. Mendelian randomization studies generally do not support a causal role of serum urate in kidney disease, hypertension, or diabetes, although interpretation is complicated by nonhomogeneous populations, a failure to consider environmental interactions, and a lack of understanding of how the genetic polymorphisms affect biological mechanisms related to urate. Although several small clinical trials suggest benefits of urate-lowering therapies on kidney function, blood pressure, and insulin resistance, others have been negative, with many trials having design limitations and insufficient power. Thus, whether uric acid has a causal role in kidney and cardiovascular diseases requires further study.",

        "abstract": "The behavior of pile composite foundation is studied using the flexibility method. During the analysis, determination of the flexibility matrix (settlement) is critical. However, conventional methods of Winkler and elastic half-space foundation models are incapable of considering the time effects of soil consolidation and creep. The foundation model of Zaretsky and Tsytovich [1965] can be used to evaluate settlement for unsaturated soils, but the complexity of numerical integration over an arbitrary loading area hinders its application. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed for numerical integration by rotating the loading surface using the equiareal transformation technique. Therefore, a simplified closed-form solution is developed to calculate time dependent settlement for foundation soils. The efficacy of the proposed technique is demonstrated using illustrative examples of an elastic half-space, a rigid raft foundation without piles, and rigid pile composite foundations with multiple piles under surface loading. Furthermore, parametric study is conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of model parameters. The permeability [Formula: see text] and Poisson’s ratio [Formula: see text] are found to be important, whereas pore pressure coefficient [Formula: see text] and degree of saturation [Formula: see text] are less significant in the calculation.",

A total of 2072 cases, including different superstructures, pile foundations, soil deposits, and seismic input signals, are studied. The results are presented so that the influence of the different parameters involved in the analysis can be assessed. From an engineering point of view, both lumped parameter models provide, in general, sufficiently low errors. The choice of the most adequate model for each case will depend not only on the configuration of the structure and the soil‐foundation system but also on the assumed soil damping model, whose influence on the computed seismic responses is relevant in many cases. The nonphysical behaviour provided by the classical hysteretic damping model for the soil at zero frequency generates issues in the process of fitting the impedance functions. It is also found that larger deck displacements are predicted by Biot's model due to the higher damping at low frequencies provided by the classical hysteretic damping model.",

Here we introduce MixSIAR, an inclusive, rich, and flexible Bayesian tracer (e.g., stable isotope) mixing model framework implemented as an open-source R package. Using MixSIAR as a foundation, we provide guidance for the implementation of mixing model analyses. We begin by outlining the practical differences between mixture data error structure formulations and relate these error structures to common mixing model study designs in ecology. Because Bayesian mixing models afford the option to specify informative priors on source proportion contributions, we outline methods for establishing prior distributions and discuss the influence of prior specification on model outputs. We also discuss the options available for source data inputs (raw data versus summary statistics) and provide guidance for combining sources. We then describe a key advantage of MixSIAR over previous mixing model software—the ability to include fixed and random effects as covariates explaining variability in mixture proportions and calculate relative support for multiple models via information criteria. We present a case study of Alligator mississippiensis diet partitioning to demonstrate the power of this approach. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of limitations to mixing model applications. Through MixSIAR, we have consolidated the disparate array of mixing model tools into a single platform, diversified the set of available parameterizations, and provided developers a platform upon which to continue improving mixing model analyses in the future.",

        "abstract": "Following its introduction over three decades ago, the cohort model has been used extensively to model population trajectories over time in decision-analytic modeling studies. However, the stochastic process underlying cohort models has not been properly described. In this study, we explicate the stochastic process underlying a cohort model, by carefully formulating the dynamics of populations across health states and assigning probability rules on these dynamics. From this formulation, we explicate a mathematical representation of the system, which is given by the master equation. We solve the master equation by using the probability generation function method to obtain the explicit form of the probability of observing a particular realization of the system at an arbitrary time. The resulting generating function is used to derive the analytical expressions for calculating the mean and the variance of the process. Secondly, we represent the cohort model by a difference equation for the number of individuals across all states. From the difference equation, a continuous-time cohort model is recovered and takes the form of an ordinary differential equation. To show the equivalence between the derived stochastic process and the cohort model, we conduct a numerical exercise. We demonstrate that the population trajectories generated from the formulas match those from the cohort model simulation. In summary, the commonly-used cohort model represent the average of a continuous-time stochastic process on a multidimensional integer lattice governed by a master equation. Knowledge of the stochastic process underlying a cohort model provides a theoretical foundation for the modeling method.",

Changes to business models are recognized as a fundamental approach to realize innovations for sustainability. However, little is known about the successful adoption of sustainable business models (SBMs). The purpose of this paper is to develop a unified theoretical perspective for understanding business model innovations that lead to better organizational economic, environmental and social performance. The paper examines bodies of literature on business model innovation, sustainability innovation, networks theory, stakeholder theory and product–service systems. We develop five propositions that support the creation of SBMs in a unified perspective, which lays a foundation to support organizations in investigating and experimenting with alternative new business models. This article contributes to the emerging field of SBMs, which embed economic, environmental and social flows of value that are created, delivered and captured in a value network.

        "abstract": "In the present study, the vertical load-carrying behavior of micropile foundations with various configuration conditions was investigated based on results from model load tests. Considered configuration conditions included micropile inclination angle, spacing of micropiles, and types of micropile foundations. The ultimate load capacity of micropiles varied with installation angle, showing an initial increase and peak followed by a gradual decrease with further increase in installation angle. The ultimate load capacity of micropiled rafts was affected by both installation angle and micropile spacing. The load-carrying mechanism of micropiles for the inclined condition was proposed based on the decomposed axial and lateral load and resistance components. Using the proposed load-carrying mechanism and test results obtained in this study, the load capacity ratio for an inclined micropile was proposed. The group effect and interaction effect factors for group micropiles and micropiled rafts were proposed, resp...",

        "abstract": "The present study covenants with the static and free vibration behavior of nanocomposite sandwich plates \nreinforced by carbon nanotubes resting on Pasternak elastic foundation. Uniformly distributed (UD-CNT) and functionally \ngraded (FG-CNT) distributions of aligned carbon nanotube are considered for two types of sandwich plates such as, the face sheet reinforced and homogeneous core and the homogeneous face sheet and reinforced core. Based on the first shear deformation theory (FSDT), the Hamilton\\'s principle is employed to derive the mathematical models. The obtained solutions are numerically validated by comparison with some available cases in the literature. The elastic foundation model is assumed as one parameter Winkler - Pasternak foundation. A parametric study is conducted to study the effects of aspect ratios, foundation \nparameters, carbon nanotube volume fraction, types of reinforcement, core-to-face sheet thickness ratio and types of loads acting on the bending and free vibration analyses. It is explicitly shown that the (FG-CNT) face sheet reinforced sandwich plate has a high resistance against deflections compared to other types of reinforcement. It is also revealed that the reduction in the dimensionless natural frequency is most pronounced in core reinforced sandwich plate.",

        "abstract": "Transcranial electric stimulation aims to stimulate the brain by applying weak electrical currents at the scalp. However, the magnitude and spatial distribution of electric fields in the human brain are unknown. We measured electric potentials intracranially in ten epilepsy patients and estimated electric fields across the entire brain by leveraging calibrated current-flow models. When stimulating at 2 mA, cortical electric fields reach 0.8 V/m, the lower limit of effectiveness in animal studies. When individual whole-head anatomy is considered, the predicted electric field magnitudes correlate with the recorded values in cortical (r = 0.86) and depth (r = 0.88) electrodes. Accurate models require adjustment of tissue conductivity values reported in the literature, but accuracy is not improved when incorporating white matter anisotropy or different skull compartments. This is the first study to validate and calibrate current-flow models with in vivo intracranial recordings in humans, providing a solid foundation to target stimulation and interpret clinical trials.

However, the available evidence has not been well summarized, and there is little guidance for diagnosis and treatment of PI-IBS. The ROME Foundation has produced a working team report to summarize the available evidence on the pathophysiology of PI-IBS and provide guidance for diagnosis and treatment, based on findings reported in the literature and clinical experience.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe working team conducted an evidence-based review of publication databases for articles describing the clinical features (diagnosis), pathophysiology (intestinal sensorimotor function, microbiota, immune dysregulation, barrier dysfunction, enteroendocrine pathways, and genetics), and animal models of PI-IBS. We used a Delphi-based consensus system to create guidelines for management of PI-IBS and a developed treatment algorithm based on published findings and experiences of team members.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPI-IBS develops in about 10% of patients with infectious enteritis. Risk factors include female sex, younger age, psychological distress during or before acute gastroenteritis, and severity of the acute episode. The pathogenesis of PI-PBS appears to involve changes in the intestinal microbiome as well as epithelial, serotonergic, and immune system factors. However, these mechanisms are incompletely understood. There are no evidence-based, effective pharmacologic strategies for treatment of PI-IBS. We provide a consensus-based treatment algorithm, based on clinical presentation and potential disease mechanisms.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased on a systematic review of the literature and team experience, we summarize the clinical features, pathophysiology (from animal models and human studies), and progression of PI-IBS. Based on these findings, we present an algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of PI-IBS based on team consensus. We also propose areas for future investigation.",

        "abstract": "Uncertainty and variability are inherent to pile design and consequently, there have been considerable researches in quantifying the reliability or probability of failure of structures. This paper aims at examining and comparing the applicability and adaptability of Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR), Emotional Neural Network (ENN), Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) in the reliability analysis of pile embedded in cohesionless soil and proposes an AI-based prediction method for bearing capacity of pile foundation. To ascertain the homogeneity and distribution of the datasets, Mann–Whitney U (M–W) and Anderson–Darling (AD) tests are carried out, respectively. The performance of the developed soft computing models is ascertained using various statistical parameters. A comparative study is implemented among reliability indices of the proposed models by employing First Order Second Moment Method (FOSM). The results of FOSM showed that the ANFIS approach outperformed other models for reliability analysis of bearing capacity of pile and ENN is the worst performing model. The value of R2 for all the developed models is close to 1. The best RMSE value is achieved for the training phase of the ANFIS model (0 in training and 2.13 in testing) and the poorest for the ENN (2.03 in training and 31.24 in testing) model. Based on the experimental results of reliability indices, the developed ANFIS model is found to be very close to that computed from the original data.",

        "abstract": "Nonclinical testing has served as a foundation for evaluating potential risks and effectiveness of investigational new drugs in humans. However, the current two‐dimensional (2D) in vitro cell culture systems cannot accurately depict and simulate the rich environment and complex processes observed in vivo, whereas animal studies present significant drawbacks with inherited species‐specific differences and low throughput for increased demands. To improve the nonclinical prediction of drug safety and efficacy, researchers continue to develop novel models to evaluate and promote the use of improved cell‐ and organ‐based assays for more accurate representation of human susceptibility to drug response. Among others, the three‐dimensional (3D) cell culture models present physiologically relevant cellular microenvironment and offer great promise for assessing drug disposition and pharmacokinetics (PKs) that influence drug safety and efficacy from an early stage of drug development. Currently, there are numerous different types of 3D culture systems, from simple spheroids to more complicated organoids and organs‐on‐chips, and from single‐cell type static 3D models to cell co‐culture 3D models equipped with microfluidic flow control as well as hybrid 3D systems that combine 2D culture with biomedical microelectromechanical systems. This article reviews the current application and challenges of 3D culture systems in drug PKs, safety, and efficacy assessment, and provides a focused discussion and regulatory perspectives on the liver‐, intestine‐, kidney‐, and neuron‐based 3D cellular models.",

        "abstract": "Abstract For over 10 years, ModelSEED has been a primary resource for the construction of draft genome-scale metabolic models based on annotated microbial or plant genomes. Now being released, the biochemistry database serves as the foundation of biochemical data underlying ModelSEED and KBase. The biochemistry database embodies several properties that, taken together, distinguish it from other published biochemistry resources by: (i) including compartmentalization, transport reactions, charged molecules and proton balancing on reactions; (ii) being extensible by the user community, with all data stored in GitHub; and (iii) design as a biochemical ‘Rosetta Stone’ to facilitate comparison and integration of annotations from many different tools and databases. The database was constructed by combining chemical data from many resources, applying standard transformations, identifying redundancies and computing thermodynamic properties. The ModelSEED biochemistry is continually tested using flux balance analysis to ensure the biochemical network is modeling-ready and capable of simulating diverse phenotypes. Ontologies can be designed to aid in comparing and reconciling metabolic reconstructions that differ in how they represent various metabolic pathways. ModelSEED now includes 33,978 compounds and 36,645 reactions, available as a set of extensible files on GitHub, and available to search at https://modelseed.org/biochem and KBase.",

As another important component in the tracking system, the motion model is much less well-explored especially for some extreme scenarios. In this paper, we consider one such scenario in which the camera is mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) or drone. We build a benchmark dataset of high diversity, consisting of 70 videos captured by drone cameras. To address the challenging issue of severe camera motion, we devise simple baselines to model the camera motion by geometric transformation based on background feature points. An extensive comparison of recent state-of-the-art trackers and their motion model variants on our drone tracking dataset validates both the necessity of the dataset and the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Our aim for this work is to lay the foundation for further research in the UAV tracking area.\n \n",

        "abstract": "— The fundamental goal of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is to mimic the core cognitive activities of human including perception, memory, and reasoning. Although tremendous success has been achieved in various AI research ﬁelds (e.g., computer vision and natural language processing), the majority of existing works only focus on acquiring single cognitive ability (e.g., image classiﬁcation, reading comprehension, or visual commonsense reasoning). To overcome this limitation and take a solid step to artiﬁcial general intelligence (AGI), we develop a novel foundation model pre-trained with huge multimodal (visual and textual) data, which is able to be quickly adapted for a broad class of downstream cognitive tasks. Such a model is fundamentally diﬀerent from the multimodal foundation models recently proposed in the literature that typically make strong semantic correlation assumption and expect exact alignment between image and text modalities in their pre-training data, which is often hard to satisfy in practice thus limiting their generalization abilities. To resolve this issue, we propose to pre-train our foundation model by self-supervised learning with weak semantic correlation data crawled from the Internet and show that state-of-the-art results can be obtained on a wide range of downstream tasks (both single-modal and cross-modal). Particularly, with novel model-interpretability tools developed in this work, we demonstrate that strong imagination ability (even with hints of commonsense) is now possessed by our foundation model. We believe our work makes a transformative stride towards AGI and will have broad impact on various AI+ ﬁelds (e.g., neuroscience and healthcare)",

        "abstract": "Humans’ interactions with each other or with socially competent machines exhibit lawful coordination patterns at multiple levels of description. According to Coordination Dynamics, such laws specify the flow of coordination states produced by functional synergies of elements (e.g., cells, body parts, brain areas, people…) that are temporarily organized as single, coherent units. These coordinative structures or synergies may be mathematically characterized as informationally coupled self-organizing dynamical systems (Coordination Dynamics). In this paper, we start from a simple foundation, an elemental model system for social interactions, whose behavior has been captured in the Haken-Kelso-Bunz (HKB) model. We follow a tried and tested scientific method that tightly interweaves experimental neurobehavioral studies and mathematical models. We use this method to further develop a body of empirical research that advances the theory toward more generalized forms. In concordance with this interdisciplinary spirit, the present paper is written both as an overview of relevant advances and as an introduction to its mathematical underpinnings. We demonstrate HKB’s evolution in the context of social coordination along several directions, with its applicability growing to increasingly complex scenarios. In particular, we show that accommodating for symmetry breaking in intrinsic dynamics and coupling, multiscale generalization and adaptation are principal evolutions. We conclude that a general framework for social coordination dynamics is on the horizon, in which models support experiments with hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.",

This research emphasis on the implementation of newly developed machine learning models called hybridized Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, Ant Colony optimizer (ACO), Differential Evolution (DE), and Genetic Algorithm (GA) as efficient approaches to predict settlement of shallow foundation over cohesion soil properties. The width of footing (B), pressure of footing (qa), geometry of footing (L/B), count of SPT blow (N), and ratio of footing embedment (Df/B) are considered as predictive variables. Nonhomogeneity and inconsistency of employed dataset is a major concern during prediction modeling. Hence, two different modeling scenarios (i) preprocessed dataset (PP) and (ii) nonprocessed (initial) dataset (NP) were inspected. To assess the accuracy of the applied hybrid models and standalone one, multiple statistical metrics were computed and analyzed over the training and testing phases. Results indicated ANFIS-PSO model exhibited an accurate and reliable prediction data intelligent and had the highest predictability performance against all employed models. In addition, results demonstrated that data preprocessing is highly essential to be performed prior to building the predictive models. Overall, ANFIS-PSO model showed a robust machine learning for settlement prediction.",

Starting from BERT and ViT, we design a unified transformer consisting of modality-specific tokenizers, a shared transformer encoder, and task-specific output heads. To efficiently pre-train the proposed model jointly on unpaired images and text, we propose two novel techniques: (i) We employ the separately-trained BERT and ViT models as teachers and apply knowledge distillation to provide additional, accurate supervision signals for the joint training; (ii) We propose a novel gradient masking strategy to balance the parameter updates from the image and text pre-training losses. We evaluate the jointly pre-trained transformer by fine-tuning it on image classification tasks and natural language understanding tasks, respectively. The experiments show that the resultant unified foundation transformer works surprisingly well on both the vision-only and text-only tasks, and the proposed knowledge distillation and gradient masking strategy can effectively lift the performance to approach the level of separately-trained models.",

A standard grading system would facilitate more accurate comparison across laboratories and more robust comparisons of different models and interventions.",

Nevertheless, the adoption of standard documentation practices across the field of NLP promotes more accessible and detailed descriptions of NLP datasets and models, while supporting researchers and developers in reflecting on their work.

Against with low accuracy and limited applicability of a single model in forecasting, a PSO-GM-BP model was established, which used the PSO optimization algorithm to optimize and improve the GM (1, 1) model and the BP network model, respectively. Combining a small amount of measured data during the excavation of a bottomless foundation pit in a Changsha subway station, the calculations based on the PSO-GM model, the PSO-BP network model, and the PSO-GM-BP model compared. The results show that both the GM (1, 1) and BP neural network models can predict accurate results. The prediction optimized by the particle swarm algorithm is more accurate and has more substantial applicability. Due to its reliable accuracy and wide application range, the PSO-GM-BP model can effectively guide the construction of foundation pits, and it also has certain reference significance for other engineering applications.",

In this study, the rigid, massless, and viscoelastic artificial boundary foundation models were established to consider the effect of dam–foundation dynamic interaction on the dynamic responses of the dam. Three reservoir water simulation methods, namely, the Westergaard added mass method, and incompressible and compressible potential fluid methods, were used to account for the effect of hydrodynamic pressure on the dynamic characteristics and seismic responses of the dam. The ranges of the truncation boundary of the foundation and reservoir in numerical analysis were further investigated. The research results showed that the viscoelastic artificial boundary foundation was more efficient than the massless foundation in the simulation of the radiation damping effect of the far-field foundation. It was found that a foundation size of 3 times the dam height was the most reasonable range of the truncation boundary of the foundation. The dynamic interaction of the reservoir foundation had a significant influence on the dam stress.",

Despite significant progress capturing trait variation within and among stems and leaves, identification of trait syndromes within fine-root systems and between fine roots and other plant organs is limited. Here we discuss three underappreciated areas where focused measurements of fine-root traits can make significant contributions to ecosystem science. These include assessment of spatiotemporal variation in fine-root traits, integration of mycorrhizal fungi into fine-root-trait frameworks, and the need for improved scaling of traits measured on individual roots to ecosystem-level processes. Progress in each of these areas is providing opportunities to revisit how below-ground processes are represented in terrestrial biosphere models. Targeted measurements of fine-root traits with clear linkages to ecosystem processes and plant responses to environmental change are strongly needed to reduce empirical and model uncertainties. Further identifying how and when suites of root and whole-plant traits are coordinated or decoupled will ultimately provide a powerful tool for modeling plant form and function at local and global scales.",

To date no standards are available for the assessment of the use of helical piles in the offshore environment. State-of-the art installation and uplift capacity assessment is based on field onshore tests on small helical piles. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the current knowledge on helical piles considering uplift capacity, cyclic load, installation torque models and the parameters affecting the installation torque, to understand whether they can be considered for potential offshore applications. The paper could be of valuable interest for engineers and contractors involved in the offshore installation of piles.",

Agent-based modeling is increasingly used to capture the interaction between individual decision-making and the environment. In this paper, we provide a review of drought risk agent-based models with a focus on behavioral rules. This review leads to the conclusion that human decision rules in existing drought risk agent-based models are often based on ad hoc assumptions without a solid theoretical and empirical foundation. Subsequently, we review behavioral economic and psychological theories to provide a clear overview of theories that can improve the theoretical foundation of smallholder farmer behavior and we review empirical parameterization, calibration, and validation methods of those theories. Based on these reviews, we provide a conceptual framework that can give guidance for the integration of behavioral theories in agent-based models. We conclude with an agenda to guide future research in this field.",

We conducted a systematic review of literature on OLMs and compared the results with a previously conducted review of LADs for learners in terms of (i) data use and modelling, (ii) key publication venues, (iii) authors and articles, (iv) key themes, and (v) system evaluation. We highlight the similarities and differences between the research on LADs and OLMs. Our key contribution is a bridge between these two areas as a foundation for building upon the strengths of each. We report the following key results from the review: in reports of new OLMs, almost 60% are based on a single type of data; 33% use behavioral metrics; 39% support input from the user; 37% have complex models; and just 6% involve multiple applications. Key associated themes include intelligent tutoring systems, learning analytics, and self-regulated learning. Notably, compared with LADs, OLM research is more likely to be interactive (81% of papers compared with 31% for LADs), report evaluations (76% versus 59%), use assessment data (100% versus 37%), provide a comparison standard for students (52% versus 38%), but less likely to use behavioral metrics, or resource use data (33% against 75% for LADs).

        "abstract": "The paper investigates the problem of Soil‐Foundation‐Structure Interaction (SFSI) for buildings supported on piles through the comparative analysis between the fixed base and the compliant base assumptions. The structure, a nine‐storey residential building (with or without infills), is modelled in non‐linear regime while the piled foundation is idealized by means of independent lumped parameters models, either linear or non‐linear. In this last case, the soil‐foundation system is replaced by an assembly of viscous‐dampers, fictitious masses and non‐linear springs modelled according to the classical Bouc‐Wen formulation, so as to account for the hysteretic behaviour of the foundation. A detailed calibration procedure for both linear and non‐linear foundation models is also presented and discussed. Two different natural soil deposits are considered, a pyroclastic deposit and a deep layer of lacustrine clay. The results undertaken in the context of a probabilistic analysis show that SFSI may lead to a significant reduction of the seismic demand in infilled buildings at low and intermediate earthquake intensity levels. Conversely, at higher intensity earthquakes the seismic demand is not affected by the non‐linear springs. It is shown that a proper modelling of radiation mechanism at foundation level is crucial for a reliable and sustainable prediction of SFSI effects.",

HRQL and mobility were measured with the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) and Timed Up and Go (TUG). We compared self-reported regular exercisers (≥2.5 hours/week) with people who did not exercise 2.5 hours/week. Then we quantified changes in HRQL and mobility associated with 30-minute increases in exercise, across PD severity, using mixed effects regression models.\n\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants with three observational study visits (n = 3408) were younger, with milder PD, than participants with fewer visits. After 2 years, consistent exercisers and people who started to exercise regularly after their baseline visit had smaller declines in HRQL and mobility than non-exercisers (p < 0.05). Non-exercisers worsened by 1.37 points on the PDQ-39 and a 0.47 seconds on the TUG per year. Increasing exercise by 30 minutes/week was associated with slower declines in HRQL (-0.16 points) and mobility (-0.04 sec). The benefit of exercise on HRQL was greater in advanced PD (-0.41 points) than mild PD (-0.14 points; p < 0.02).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nConsistently exercising and starting regular exercise after baseline were associated with small but significant positive effects on HRQL and mobility changes over two years. The greater association of exercise with HRQL in advanced PD supports improving encouragement and facilitation of exercise in advanced PD.",

        "abstract": "Intermittently powered devices enable new applications in harsh or inaccessible environments, such as space or in-body implants, but also introduce problems in programmability and correctness. Researchers have developed programming models to ensure that programs make progress and do not produce erroneous results due to memory inconsistencies caused by intermittent executions. As the technology has matured, more and more features are added to intermittently powered devices, such as I/O. Prior work has shown that all existing intermittent execution models have problems with repeated device or sensor inputs (RIO). RIOs could leave intermittent executions in an inconsistent state. Such problems and the proliferation of existing intermittent execution models necessitate a formal foundation for intermittent computing. In this paper, we formalize intermittent execution models, their correctness properties with respect to memory consistency and inputs, and identify the invariants needed to prove systems correct. We prove equivalence between several existing intermittent systems. To address RIO problems, we define an algorithm for identifying variables affected by RIOs that need to be restored after reboot and prove the algorithm correct. Finally, we implement the algorithm in a novel intermittent runtime system that is correct with respect to input operations and evaluate its performance.",

        "abstract": "Purpose The uncertainty in supply and the short shelf life of blood products have led to a substantial outdating of the collected donor blood. On the other hand, hospitals and blood centers experience severe blood shortage due to the very limited donor population. Therefore, the necessity to forecast the blood supply to minimize outdating as well as shortage is obvious. This study aims to efficiently forecast the supply of blood components at blood centers. Methods Two different types of forecasting techniques, time series and machine learning algorithms, are developed and the best performing method for the given case study is determined. Under the time series, we consider the Autoregressive (AUTOREG), Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA, Seasonal Exponential Smoothing Method (ESM), and Holt-Winters models. Artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple regression are considered under the machine learning algorithms. Results We leverage five years worth of historical blood supply data from the Taiwan Blood Services Foundation (TBSF) to conduct our study. On comparing the different techniques, we found that time series forecasting methods yield better results than machine learning algorithms. More specifically, the least value of the error measures is observed in seasonal ESM and ARIMA models. Conclusions The models developed can act as a decision support system to administrators and pathologists at blood banks, blood donation centers, and hospitals to determine their inventory policy based on the estimated future blood supply. The forecasting models developed in this study can help healthcare managers to manage blood inventory control more efficiently, thus reducing blood shortage and blood wastage.",

RL enables autonomous decision makers (e.g., traffic signal controllers) to observe, learn, and select the optimal action (e.g., determining the appropriate traffic phase and its timing) to manage traffic such that system performance is improved. This article reviews various RL models and algorithms applied to traffic signal control in the aspects of the representations of the RL model (i.e., state, action, and reward), performance measures, and complexity to establish a foundation for further investigation in this research field.

While relevant theories and technologies are evolving, data organization models have always been the foundation of VGE development, and they require further exploration. Based on the comprehensive consideration of the characteristics of VGEs, geographic scene is proposed to organize geographic information and data. We empirically find that geographic scene provides a suitable organization schema to support geo-visualization, geo-simulation, and geo-collaboration. To systematically investigate the concept and method of geographic scene, Geographic Scenario is proposed as the theory on developing geographic scene, and corresponding key issues of the Geographic Scenario are illustrated in this article.

        "abstract": "Stablecoins are one of the most widely capitalized type of cryptocurrency. However, their risks vary significantly according to their design and are often poorly understood. We seek to provide a sound foundation for stablecoin theory, with a risk-based functional characterization of the economic structure of stablecoins. First, we match existing economic models to the disparate set of custodial systems. Next, we characterize the unique risks that emerge in non-custodial stablecoins and develop a model framework that unifies existing models from economics and computer science. We further discuss how this modeling framework is applicable to a wide array of cryptoeconomic systems, including cross-chain protocols, collateralized lending, and decentralized exchanges. These unique risks yield unanswered research questions that will form the crux of research in decentralized finance going forward.",

        "abstract": ": This study investigates the forced vibration of functionally graded hexagonal nano-size plates for the first time. A quasi-three-dimensional (3D) plate theory including stretching effect is used to model the anisotropic plate as a continuum one where small-scale effects are considered based on nonlocal strain gradient theory. Also, the plate is assumed on a Pasternak foundation in which normal and transverse shear loads are taken into account. The governing equations of motion are obtained via the Hamiltonian principles which are solved using analytical based methods by means of Navier’s approximation. The influences of the exponential factor, nonlocal parameter, strain gradient parameter, Pasternak foundation coefficients, length-to-thickness, and length-to-width ratios on the dynamic response of the nanoplates are examined. In addition, the accuracy of an isotropic approximate instead of the anisotropic model is studied. The dynamic behavior of the system shows that mechanical mathematics-based models may get better results considering the anisotropic model because the dynamic response can cause prominent differences (up to 17%) between isotropic approximation and anisotropic model. soft and stiff graded anisotropic nanoplates including small-scaling parameters. The numerical results reveal that the elastic foundation can decrease the deflection of the system under the sinusoidal loading. Also, increasing the nonlocal parameter decreases the stiffness of the plate that leads to",

In this paper, relevant parameters of the HS model in Shenzhen Bay in China were studied through one-dimensional consolidation tests and triaxial shear tests. Analytical methods of reference secant stiffness and failure ratio of soft soil were systematically studied, the influence of shear rates on reference secant stiffness and failure ratio of soft soil was analyzed, and the relationship between stiffness parameters and compressive modulus of soft soil was established. The results showed that reference secant stiffness and failure ratio of soft soil obtained by different analytical methods were quite different, and the errors of reference secant stiffness and failure ratio of soft soil obtained by stress-strain curves were the smallest and the stability was the best; at the same time, with increase of shear rates, the peak deviator stress and reference secant stiffness of soft soil increased, but failure ratio did not change much. The research results could provide a reference of parameter analysis of soft soil for the HS model in the numerical analysis and similar working conditions of foundation pits.",

Currently, they are often characterized via intensity function which limits model's expressiveness due to unrealistic assumptions on its parametric form used in practice. Furthermore, they are learned via maximum likelihood approach which is prone to failure in multi-modal distributions of sequences. In this paper, we propose an intensity-free approach for point processes modeling that transforms nuisance processes to a target one. Furthermore, we train the model using a likelihood-free leveraging Wasserstein distance between point processes.

These systems provide a foundation for cognitive function in higher organisms; attention, emotion, goal-directed behavior, and decision-making derive from the interaction between the neuromodulatory systems and brain areas, such as the amygdala, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and sensory cortices. Given their strong influence on behavior and cognition, these systems also play a key role in disease states and are the primary target of many current treatment strategies. The fact that these systems interact with each other either directly or indirectly, however, makes it difficult to understand how a failure in one or more systems can lead to a particular symptom or pathology. In this review, we explore experimental evidence, as well as focus on computational and theoretical models of neuromodulation. Better understanding of neuromodulatory systems may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies for a number of brain disorders.",

I then confront present day's generators with this theoretical basis by detailed discussions of the various reaction processes. Finally, as examples I then show for various experiments results of the generator GiBUU for lepton semi-inclusive cross sections as well as particle spectra. I also discuss features of these cross sections in terms of the various reaction components, with predictions for DUNE. Finally, I argue for the need for a new neutrino generator that respects our present-day knowledge of both nuclear theory and nuclear reactions and is as much state-of-the-art as the experimental equipment.

Children with medical complexity (CMC) are a subset of children and youth with special health care needs with high resource use and health care costs. Novel care delivery models in which care coordination and other services to CMC are provided are a focus of national and local health care and policy initiatives. Current models of care for CMC can be grouped into 3 main categories: (1) primary care–centered models, (2) consultative- or comanagement-centered models, and (3) episode-based models. Each model has unique advantages and disadvantages. Evaluations of these models have demonstrated positive outcomes, but most studies have limited generalizability for broader populations of CMC. A lack of standardized outcomes and population definitions for CMC hinders assessment of the comparative effectiveness of different models of care and identification of which components of the models lead to positive outcomes. Ongoing challenges include inadequate support for family caregivers and threats to the sustainability of models of care. Collaboration among key stakeholders (patients, families, providers, payers, and policy makers) is needed to address the gaps in care and create best practice guidelines to ensure the delivery of high-value care for CMC.",

        "abstract": "Background: Cleft deformities of the lip and palate affect nearly one in 500 to 700 births, and lead to increased morbidity and mortality if untreated. Nevertheless, significant global disparities in access to timely and appropriate care still exist. The relatively basic infrastructure required to surgically correct these deformities and large unmet disease burden have resulted in a significant number of foundation-based cleft care initiatives focused on developing countries. In this study, the authors evaluate the peer-reviewed literature generated by these foundations in an attempt to assess their clinical, scientific, educational, and economic impact. Methods: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed using key search terms, and the level of evidence of identified articles was determined. Data were then analyzed to determine the different models of foundation-based cleft care in developing countries, and their clinical, scientific, educational, and economic impact. Results: A total of 244 articles were identified through the authors’ search and reviewed. Foundation-based cleft care initiatives in developing countries have significantly contributed to a better understanding of disease epidemiology, barriers to care, safety considerations, complications and outcomes, and international and local cleft surgery education. The cleft care center model is more cost-effective than the surgical mission model and provides more sustainable care. Conclusions: Foundation-based cleft care prevents significant morbidity in developing countries and has provided valuable resources for capacity building. The surgical mission model should be considered as a transitory conduit for establishing the more effective and sustainable cleft care center model of care.",

Email:amir.kaynia@ntnu.no Abstract This paper presents dynamic response and fatigue analyses of several bottom-mounted offshore wind turbine (OWT) models, simulated in the aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation tool FAST. The distinction between the models is the foundations, which are modelled with different methods, concepts, and dimensions. The US National Renewable Energy Laboratory has developed a 5-MW reference turbine supported on a monopile, the NREL 5MW, which was used as a reference model in this paper. The paper presents the implementation and comparison of two different foundation modeling methods, referred to as the simplified apparent fixity method and the improved apparent fixity method. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses of different monopile dimensions were performed, followed by sensitivity analyses of suction caisson foundations of different dimensions. The final part of the paper presents fatigue analyses for the foundation models considered in this study subjected to 17 load cases. Fatigue damage, fatigue life, and damage equivalent loads were calculated, as well as the relative fatigue contribution from each load case.",

The meeting was convened to evaluate the progress in the development of a new cardiac safety paradigm, the Comprehensive in Vitro Proarrhythmia Assay (CiPA). The opinions regarding these principles reflect the collective views of those who participated in the discussion of this topic both at and after the breakout session. Although primarily discussed in the context of in silico models, these principles describe the interface between experimental input and model‐based interpretation and are intended to be general enough to be applied to other types of nonclinical models for proarrhythmia assessment.

Topographic maps were used to determine the topographical factors. Additional soil and forest parameters were examined using information obtained from soil and forest maps. A total of 17 factors affecting landslide occurrence were selected and a spatial database was constructed. Naïve Bayes and Bayesian network models were applied to predict landslides based on selected risk factors. The two models showed accuracies of 78.3 and 79.8%, respectively.

By using Hamilton's principle, the nonlinear equations of motion for the fluid conveying micro beam were obtained. Micro beam was considered as resting on an elastic foundation. The obtained equations of motion were became independence from material and geometric structure by nondimensionalization. Approximate solutions of the system were achieved with using the multiple time scales method (a perturbation method). The effects of micro-structure, spring constant, the occupancy rate of micro beam, the fluid velocity on natural frequency and solutions were researched. MCST compared with classical beam theory and showed that beam models that based on classical beam theory are not capable of describing the size effects. Comparisons of classical beam theory and MCST were showed in graphics and these graphics also proved that obtained mathematical model suitable for describe the behavior of normal sized beams.",

        "abstract": "A direct finite element method is presented for nonlinear earthquake analysis of interacting dam–water–foundation rock systems. The analysis procedure applies viscous damper absorbing boundaries to truncate the semi‐unbounded fluid and foundation‐rock domains and specifies at these boundaries effective earthquake forces determined from the design ground motion defined at a control point on the free surface. The analysis procedure is validated numerically by computing the frequency response functions and transient response of an idealized dam–water–foundation rock system and comparing with results from the substructure method. Because the analysis procedure is applicable to nonlinear systems, it allows for modeling of concrete cracking, as well as sliding and separation at construction joints, lift joints, and at concrete–rock interfaces. Implementation of the procedure is facilitated by commercial finite element software with nonlinear material models that permit modeling of viscous damper boundaries and specification of effective earthquake forces at these boundaries.

        "abstract": "Probability theory is the mathematical study of uncertainty. In the real world, probability models are used to predict the movement of stock prices, compute insurance premiums, and evaluate cancer treatments. In mathematics, probabilistic techniques are sometimes applied to problems in analysis, combinatorics, and discrete math. Most importantly for this course, probability theory is the foundation of the field of statistics, which is concerned with decision making under uncertainty. This course is an introduction to probability theory for statisticians. Applications of the concepts in this course appear throughout theoretical and applied statistics courses. In probability theory, uncertain outcomes are called random; that is, given the information we currently have about an event, we are uncertain of its outcome. For example, suppose I flip a coin with two sides, labeled Heads and Tails, and secretly record the side facing up upon landing, called the outcome. We call such a procedure an experiment or a random process. Even though I have performed the experiment and I know the outcome, you only know the specifications of the experiment; you are uncertain of its outcome. We call such an outcome random. Of all non-trivial processes, coin flipping is the simplest because there are only two possible outcomes from any coin flip, heads and tails. In fact, although coin flipping is the simplest random process, it is fundamental to much of probability theory, as we will learn throughout this course. In the above experiment, the possible outcomes are Heads and Tails, and an event is any set of possible outcomes. There are four events for this experiment: ∅ := {}, {Heads}, {Tails} and {Heads,Tails}. If the result of the experiment is an outcome in E, then E is said to occur. The set of possible outcomes is called the sample space and is usually denoted Ω. For any event, we can count the number of favorable outcomes associated to that event. For example, if E := {Heads} is the event of interest, then there is #E = 1 favorable outcome and the fraction of favorable outcomes to total outcomes is #E/#Ω = 1/2. For a probability model in which the occurrence of each outcome in Ω is equally likely, the fraction #E/#Ω is a natural probability assignment for the event E, which we denote P(E). This choice of P(E) comes from the frequentist interpretation of probability, by which P(E) is interpreted as the proportion of times E occurs in a large number of repetitions of the same experiment.",

We describe a model of parental (or more broadly, surrogate) decision-making that includes 5 aspects of decision-making that other models simplify or omit. First, we describe problem structuring recognizing that parents often face multiple potential problems or decisions with multiple potential solutions, rather than a single problem, and the initial challenge is deciding which of the problems to focus on. Second, we discuss sense-making recognizing that difficult decisions are not made in isolation but are often part of a confusing, labyrinthian situation in which disoriented parents must make a series of decisions over time in hopes of getting closer to 1 or more goals. Third, we describe path dependency recognizing that decisions influence what and how decisions are made later. Fourth, we discuss personal sense of duty recognizing that parents and other surrogate decision-makers have central personal roles, self-identities, and relationships with the patient, culminating in a personal sense of duty, such as what they perceive they should do to be in their own judgment a “good parent,” which substantially affects their decision-making. Fifth, we describe self-judgments recognizing that parents experience distress when they judge themselves as falling short of their duties or if they think others are judging them for falling short. Clinical practice, medical ethics, and research regarding decision support can all benefit by acknowledging and addressing these key aspects of medical decision-making.",

Finally, we describe approaches developed in laboratory studies to mitigate treatment relapse using a variety of approaches involving both antecedent and consequence-based interventions.

        "abstract": "Rocking column‐foundation system is a new design concept for bridges that can reduce overall seismic damage, minimize construction and repair time, and achieve lower cost in general. However, such system involves complex dynamic responses due to impacts and highly nonlinear rocking behavior. This study presents a dimensionless regression analysis to estimate the rocking and shaking responses of the flexible column‐foundation system under near‐fault ground motions. First, the transient drift and rocking responses of the system are solved numerically using previously established analytical models. Subsequently, the peak column drifts and uplift angles are derived as functions of ground motion characteristics and the geometric and dynamic parameters of column‐foundation system in regressed dimensionless forms. The proposed response models are further examined by validating against the numerical simulations for several as‐built bridge cases. It is shown that the proposed model not only physically quantifies the influences of prominent parameters, but also consistently reflects the complex dynamics of the system. The seismic demands of rocking column‐foundation system can be realistically predicted directly from structural and ground motion characteristics. This can significantly benefit the design of bridges incorporating this new design concept.",

This nonclassical nanobeam model contains a length scale parameter to explore the influence of strain gradients and also a nonlocal parameter to study the long-range interactions between the particles. The present model can degenerate into the classical models if the material length scale parameter and the nonlocal stress field parameter are both taken to be zero. Elastic foundation consists of two layers: a Winkler layer with variable stiffness and a Pasternak layer with constant stiffness. Linear, parabolic and sinusoidal variations of Winkler foundation in longitudinal direction are considered. Material properties are graded axially via a power-law distribution scheme. Hamilton's principle is employed to derive the governing equations that are solved applying a Galerkin-based solution for different boundary edges. Comparison study is also performed to verify the present formulation with those of previous papers. Results are presented to investigate the influences of the nonlocal and length scale parameters, various material compositions, elastic foundation parameters, type of foundation and various boundary conditions on the vibration frequencies of AFG nanobeams in detail.",

Unlike other flaviviruses, ZIKV is both arthropod- and sexually-transmitted, and has a broad tissue tropism in humans, including multiple tissues of the reproductive tract. The threats posed by ZIKV have prompted the development of multiple in vivo models to better understand the pathogenesis of ZIKV, particularly during pregnancy.

        "abstract": "Anomaly can provide valuable information for dam safety monitoring. In this paper, a methodology integrating dynamic time warping and local outlier factor to identify anomalies of time series on various time scales is proposed. The main steps of the methodology are introduced in detail. First, measured time series are preprocessed using moving average and normalization, respectively, to eliminate influence of random and amplitude variations. Following this, time series of independent variables (predictors) are selected as templates to calculate dynamic time warping distances using the global constraint to measure similarities with the dependent variable (a predicant) on a large time scale. Then, traditional regression models are built to find out contributions of independent variables to structural behavior, as well as to highlight unwanted behaviors at relatively on a small time scale. Furthermore, local outlier factor values of multivariate are computed, which helps finding anomalies on a small time scale. Finally, causes of anomalies are analyzed comprehensively. A case study is presented focus on the measured foundation uplift beneath the local riverbed blocks of Xixi reservoir dam. Results show that point anomalies occur with sudden changes of independent variables, but contextual anomalies boil down to coupled effect of high reservoir level and low ambient temperature. The natural condition of the rock foundation underlying blocks, which is characterized as intensively open tension joints, is responsible for uplift anomalies.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the small scale effects are incorporated into the free vibration analysis of single-layered graphene sheets (SLGSs) embedded in an elastic medium. To this end, Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity continuum are applied to the different types of plate theory namely as the classical plate theory (CLPT), first order shear deformation theory (FSDT), and higher order shear deformation theory (HSDT). Winkler and Pasternak foundation models used to simulate the surrounding elastic medium are compared with each other. Explicit expressions are derived to calculate the natural frequencies of square SLGSs corresponding to each type of nonlocal plate model. Selected numerical results are given to indicate the influence of the nonlocal parameter, Winkler and Pasternak elastic moduli, mode number, and the side length of SLGSs in detail. Also, comparison is made between the vibrational responses of SLGSs obtained through different nonlocal plate theories. It is found that the elastic foundation and value of nonlocal parameter have quite significant effects on the natural frequencies of SLGSs and these effects are influenced by mode number as well as side length.

This paper unifies for the first time the 2 types of rocking motion under a common experimental campaign, so that on the one hand, structural rocking can be examined under the influence of soil and on the other, foundation rocking can be examined under the influence of a linear elastic superstructure. Two building models, designed to rock above or below their foundation level so that they can reproduce structural and foundation rocking respectively, were tested side by side in a centrifuge. The models were placed on a dry sandbed and subjected to a sequence of earthquake motions. The range of rocking amplitude that is required for base isolation was quantified. Overall, it is shown that the relative density of sand does not influence structural rocking, while for foundation rocking, the change from dense to loose sand can affect the time‐frequency response significantly and lead to a more predictable behaviour.",

        "abstract": "The three-dimensional dynamic equations of a ring with a noncircular cross-section on an elastic foundation are obtained using the Hamilton variation principle. In contrast to the previous rings on elastic foundation model, the developed model incorporates both the in-plane and out-of-plane bend and the out-of-plane torsion in displacement fields. The errors in the derivation of the initial stress and the work of the internal pressure in previous rings on elastic foundation models have been corrected. The mode expansion was used to obtain the analytical solution of the natural frequency. The initial motivation is to develop a theoretical model for car tire dynamics. Therefore, to validate the proposed model, the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations of a truck tire have been analyzed using the proposed method. To further verify the accuracy of the model, the results of the theoretical formula are compared with the finite element analysis and modal test, and good agreement can be found.",

The centrifuge tests were performed in lightly over-consolidated clay and heavily over-consolidated clay, and three bucket foundation models with aspect ratios of 0.38, 0.5, and 1.3 were tested. The tests were force-controlled, and both static loads and cyclic loads were applied. In static tests, ultimate bearing capacities of suction bucket foundations were extracted from load-displacement curves as the first method, and the results were reinforced by stiffness-displacement curves. The displacement rates were calculated to find critical bearing capacities and ultimate bearing capacities of the foundations as the second method. The cyclic tests include cyclic loads with uniform and increased amplitudes. The accumulated lateral displacements and secant stiffnesses were discussed, and their variations with cycle numbers were studied.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a novel framework for data quality measurement is proposed by adopting a measure-theoretic treatment of the problem. Instead of considering a specific setting in which quality must be assessed, our approach departs more formally from the concept of measurement. The basic assumption of the framework is that the highest possible quality can be described by means of a set of predicates. Quality of data is then measured by evaluating those predicates and by combining their evaluations. This combination is based on a capacity function (i.e., a fuzzy measure) that models for each combination of predicates the capacity with respect to the quality of the data. It is shown that expression of quality on an ordinal scale entails a high degree of interpretation and a compact representation of the measurement function. Within this purely ordinal framework for measurement, it is shown that reasoning about quality beyond the ordinal level naturally originates from the uncertainty about predicate evaluation. It is discussed how the proposed framework is positioned with respect to other approaches with particular attention to aggregation of measurements. The practical usability of the framework is discussed for several well known dimensions of data quality and demonstrated in a use-case study about clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Ubiquitous sensing and unique characteristics of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have led to an increase in application areas such as smart parking, environmental monitoring, automotive industries and sports. In recent years, WSNs have gained more significance as the foundation infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT), which has greatly increased the number of connected objects with instantaneous communication and data processing. However, designing energy-efficient models for integrating WSNs into IoT is a challenging issue due to scalability and interoperability of IoT, and previous approaches designed for WSNs cannot be applied directly. This study proposes two energy-efficient models for WSNs in the IoT environment: (i) a service-aware clustering model where individual sensor nodes are assigned roles based on their service delivery; and (ii) an energy-aware clustering model. Performance evaluation shows better energy efficiency, end-to-end delay and network load balance of the proposed models for integrating wireless sensor networks into the IoT protocol compared with low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy centralised protocol and fuzzy C-means clustering protocol.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the response and behavior of machine foundations resting on dry and saturated sand was investigated experimentally. In order to investigate the response of soil and footing to steady state dynamic loading, a physical model was manufactured to simulate steady state harmonic load at different operating frequencies. Total of 84 physical models were performed. The footing parameters are related to the size of the rectangular footing and depth of embedment. Two sizes of rectangular steel model footing were tested at the surface and at 50 mm depth below model surface. Meanwhile the investigated parameters of the soil condition include dry and saturated sand for two relative densities 30% and 80%. The response of the footing was elaborated by measuring the amplitude of displacement by the vibration meter. The response of the soil to dynamic loading includes measuring the stresses inside the soil using piezoelectric sensors as well as measuring the excess pore water pressure using pore water pressure transducers. It was concluded that the maximum displacement amplitude response of the foundation resting on dry sand models is more than that on the saturated sand by about 5.0–10%. The maximum displacement amplitude of footing is reduced to half when the size of footing is doubled for dry and saturated sand. The final settlement (St) of the foundation increases with increasing the amplitude of dynamic force, operating frequency and degree of saturation. Meanwhile, it is reduced with increasing the relative density of sand, modulus of elasticity, and embedding inside soils. The excess pore water pressure increases with increasing the relative density of the sand, the amplitude of dynamic loading and the operating frequency. In contrast, the rate of dissipation of the excess pore water pressure during dynamic loading is more in the case of loose sand.",

        "title": "When a Foundation Crumbles: Forecasting Forest Dynamics Following the Decline of the Foundation Species Tsuga Canadensis",
        "abstract": "In the forests of northeastern North America, invasive insects and pathogens are causing major declines in some tree species and a subsequent reorganization of associated forest communities. Using observations and experiments to investigate the consequences of such declines are hampered because trees are long-lived. Simulation models can provide a means to forecast possible futures based on different scenarios of tree species decline, death, and removal. Such modeling is particularly urgent for species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation species in many northeastern forest regions that is declining due to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). Here, we used an individual-based forest simulator, SORTIE-ND, to forecast changes in forest communities in Central Massachusetts over the next 200 yr under a range of scenarios: a no-adelgid, status quo scenario; partial resistance of hemlock to the adelgid; adelgid irruption and total hemlock decline over 25 yr, adelgid irruption and salvage logging of hemlock trees; and two scenarios of preemptive logging of hemlock and hemlock/white pine. We applied the model to six study plots comprising a range of initial species mixtures, abundances, and levels of hemlock dominance. Simulations indicated that eastern white pine, and to a lesser extent black birch and American beech, would gain most in relative abundance and basal area following hemlock decline. The relative dominance of these species depended on initial conditions and the amount of hemlock mortality, and their combined effect on neighborhood-scale community dynamics. Simulated outcomes were little different whether hemlock died out gradually due to the adelgid or disappeared rapidly following logging. However, if eastern hemlock were to become partially resistant to the adelgid, hemlock would be able to retain its dominance despite substantial losses of basal area. Our modeling highlights the complexities associated with secondary forest succession due to ongoing hemlock decline and loss. We emphasize the need both for a precautionary approach in deciding between management intervention or simply doing nothing in these declining hemlock forests, and for clear aims and understanding regarding desired community- and ecosystem-level outcomes.",

        "abstract": "Large-diameter multi-bucket foundation is well suited for offshore wind turbines at deeper water than 20 m. Air floating transportation is one of the key technologies for the cost-effective development of bucket foundation. To predict the dynamic behavior of large-diameter tripod bucket foundation (LDTBF) supported by an air cushion and a water plug inside every bucket in waves, three 1/25-scale physical model tests with different bucket spacing were conducted in waves; detailed prototype foundation models were established using a hydrodynamic software MOSES with a draft of 4.0 m, 4.5 m, and 5.0 m and with a water depth of 10.0 m, 11.25 m, and 12.5 m. The numerical and experimental results are consistent for heaving motion, while exhibiting favorable agreement for pitching motion. The results show that the resonant periods for heaving motion increased with increasing draft and water depth. The maximum amplitude for heaving motion first decreased and then increased with the increase of water depth and spacing between the buckets. The maximum amplitude for pitching motion first decreased and then increased with increasing water depth but decreased with increasing spacing between the buckets. The wider the spacing between the bucket foundations, the larger the heave response amplitude operators (RAOs). Simply improving the pitch RAOs by increasing the spacing between bucket foundations is limited and negatively affects motion performance during the transportation of LDTBF.",

There are also many standards which guide the practice of reliability engineering, and every year a number of scientific papers are published which address reliability engineering issues. Yet the area faces many challenges, in particular when addressing systems characterised by large uncertainties, and accurate prediction models are not easily established. We see alternative analysis perspectives being advocated, with varying degrees of theoretical justification. This article argues that there is potential for improvements to be made in terms of both theoretical frameworks and the practice of reliability engineering to meet these challenges and guide reliability engineers and decision-makers. Examples relate to the understanding and treatment of uncertainties, and the use of ideas and methods from risk management. Clear recommendations are provided on how to obtain such improvements.",

We argue that big data should be perceived as a continuous, unstructured and unprocessed dynamics of primitives, rather than as points (snapshots) or summaries (aggregates) of an underlying phenomenon. Given this, we show that big data can be generated through agent-based models but not by equation-based models. Though statistical and machine learning tools can be used to analyse big data, they do not constitute a big data-generation mechanism. Furthermore, agent-based models can aid in evaluating the quality (interpreted as information aggregation efficiency) of big data. Based on this, we argue that agent-based modelling can serve as a possible foundation for big data. We substantiate this interpretation through some pioneering studies from the 1980s on swarm intelligence and several prototypical agent-based models developed around the 2000s.",

The layer's lower‐surface is either bonded or sliding on a rigid substrate. The present Kerr‐type model provides a linear differential relation between the pressure and the normal deflection of the layer's upper‐surface, and reduces to the existing foundation models when high‐order differential relations are neglected. The critical buckling force is then obtained for both an infinitely long beam and a simply‐supported beam of finite length, based on a simple formula which is valid for both a compressible and an incompressible layer. Reasonable agreement with the existing numerical results and our finite element results shows that the present model has the capability to capture the support effect of the elastic layer, and can be used to study the buckling or the bending of a beam bonded on an elastic layer.",

Three different models are used: (1) a non-linear elasto-plastic model including hysteretic behaviour effects, (2) a linear elastic model and (3) a non-linear elastic model, using numerical simulations with an aero-hydro-servo-elastic computational tool. Depending on the environmental condition, different dynamic processes dominate the responses. For parked states, deviations between models up to 160% were found. For wind wave-misalignment over 30° in operational cases, differences up to 180% were found for low sea states and 119% for high sea sates. Both nonlinear foundation damping and stiffness formulation have considerable effect on the responses, with hysteretic effects becoming crucial when aerodynamic damping is negligible in the direction of the response. Attention is required when comparing the fatigue damage only at the mudline, as larger variations between the models may occur in the embedded part of the monopile, where the absolute maximum is found.",

Hartford Foundation (JAHF) made improving the care of older adults one of its two priorities in 1983 and its sole priority in 1994. To accomplish this, the foundation adopted a two-part strategy: first, create a field of professionals capable of caring for an aging population, and second, test models of care for older adults. The JAHF steadfastly pursued that strategy until 2013, when it adopted an approach focused on advancing age-friendly health systems. Geriatrics is now a recognized medical, nursing, and social work specialty, although low reimbursement, the stigma associated with caring for older people, and low prestige discourage students from entering it. Foundation-funded models of care have proven viable, and one of them-palliative care-has been widely adopted.

The method can be used to determine the actual stress conditions of a prototype storage‐tank structure. It was used in the present study to investigate the soil‐foundation‐structure interactions of a simplified storage tank under two different earthquake motions, which were simulated using a shaking table installed in a centrifuge basket. Three different types of foundations were considered, namely, a shallow foundation, a slab on the surface of the ground connected to piles and a slab with disconnected piles. The test results were organised to compare the ground surface and foundation motions, the slab of foundation and top of structure motions and the horizontal and vertical motions of the slab, respectively. These were used to establish the complex dynamic behaviours of tank models with different foundations. The effects of soil–foundation–structure interaction with three foundation conditions and two different earthquake motions are focused and some important factors, that should be considered for future designs are also discussed in this research.

The article provides distinctive features of the four models, analysis of the regions where specific types of models pre­vail, and the results of model testing.As it has been found, flagship universities basically develop along two gene­ric models, RCU (classical universities, nearly half of the project participants) and RTL (engineering universities, one third of the flagship universities). For most universities, the type of transformation model pursued is strongly related to their current status and external environment characteristics. However, a number of universities fall in between and cannot be classified neatly under any particular model due to some specific external and internal factors. In this case, universities may use elements of more than one transformation model at once, yet the choice of model should first of all be based on the regional factors that determine the position and role of the flagship university in terms of the priority areas of regional development.",

Radial and tangential deformation are considered. By solving the generalized eigenvalue problem, natural frequencies and flexural modes are obtained. Furthermore, the Euler–Bernoulli (E–B) theory is also employed to investigate the free vibration. For determining the necessity of the Timoshenko theory, the flexural vibration frequencies from two theories are compared. Specifically, the effects of the radius and the radial height (the thickness) of the ring on the difference between the two models are studied. In order to confirm the analytical results, finite element analysis and experiments on three test specimens are used to verify the natural frequency and flexural mode...",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT We present a 3D hydrogeological model of the central Taupo Volcanic Zone (TVZ), including seven geothermal fields. A combination of borehole data, surface geology and structures were used to generate representative geological groups at depth. The geological units in the model area have been combined into seven hydrogeological groups based primarily on rock types with similar hydraulic characteristics, with permeabilities ranging from 9 × 10−15 to 2 × 10−9 m2. The fault structures used in the model are simplified to nine faults that are laterally extensive or host significant fluid flow. These faults, other than the caldera collapse structures, strike northeast–southwest, reflecting the dominant structural trend in the TVZ. By visualising hydrogeological groups in 3D, realistic geology and hence permeability input data can be more easily integrated into numerical fluid flow models.",

The model of the rigid road pavement is a damped rectangular orthotropic plate which is supported by an elastic Kerr foundation. Semi-analytical solutions of the dynamic deflection of an orthotropic plate, with semi rigid boundary conditions are presented by using governing differential equations. The natural frequencies and mode shapes of the system are then, solved by using the modified Bolotin method considering two transcendental equations as the results of solving the solution of two auxiliaries Levy’s plate type problems. The moving traffic loads modeled by varying the amplitudes of dynamic transverse concentrated loads harmonically. Numerical studies on the soil types, foundation stiffness models, varying constant velocities and loading frequencies are conducted to show the effects of the dynamic response behaviors of the plates. The results show that the dynamic responses of the rigid road pavement influenced significantly by the type foundation stiffness models and velocity of the moving load.",

        "abstract": "Fabric is a modular and extensible open-source system for deploying and operating permissioned blockchains and one of the Hyperledger projects hosted by the Linux Foundation (www.hyperledger.org). Fabric is the first truly extensible blockchain system for running distributed applications. It supports modular consensus protocols, which allows the system to be tailored to particular use cases and trust models. Fabric is also the first blockchain system that runs distributed applications written in standard, general-purpose programming languages, without systemic dependency on a native cryptocurrency. This stands in sharp contrast to existing block-chain platforms that require \"smart-contracts\" to be written in domain-specific languages or rely on a cryptocurrency. Fabric realizes the permissioned model using a portable notion of membership, which may be integrated with industry-standard identity management. To support such flexibility, Fabric introduces an entirely novel blockchain design and revamps the way blockchains cope with non-determinism, resource exhaustion, and performance attacks. This paper describes Fabric, its architecture, the rationale behind various design decisions, its most prominent implementation aspects, as well as its distributed application programming model. We further evaluate Fabric by implementing and benchmarking a Bitcoin-inspired digital currency. We show that Fabric achieves end-to-end throughput of more than 3500 transactions per second in certain popular deployment configurations, with sub-second latency, scaling well to over 100 peers.",

        "abstract": "Pretraining large neural language models, such as BERT, has led to impressive gains on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, most pretraining efforts focus on general domain corpora, such as newswire and Web. A prevailing assumption is that even domain-specific pretraining can benefit by starting from general-domain language models. In this article, we challenge this assumption by showing that for domains with abundant unlabeled text, such as biomedicine, pretraining language models from scratch results in substantial gains over continual pretraining of general-domain language models. To facilitate this investigation, we compile a comprehensive biomedical NLP benchmark from publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that domain-specific pretraining serves as a solid foundation for a wide range of biomedical NLP tasks, leading to new state-of-the-art results across the board. Further, in conducting a thorough evaluation of modeling choices, both for pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, we discover that some common practices are unnecessary with BERT models, such as using complex tagging schemes in named entity recognition. To help accelerate research in biomedical NLP, we have released our state-of-the-art pretrained and task-specific models for the community, and created a leaderboard featuring our BLURB benchmark (short for Biomedical Language Understanding & Reasoning Benchmark) at https://aka.ms/BLURB.",

Most past defenses are best effort and have been shown to be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks. Recently a set of certified defenses have been introduced, which provide guarantees of robustness to norm-bounded attacks. However these defenses either do not scale to large datasets or are limited in the types of models they can support. This paper presents the first certified defense that both scales to large networks and datasets (such as Google’s Inception network for ImageNet) and applies broadly to arbitrary model types. Our defense, called PixelDP, is based on a novel connection between robustness against adversarial examples and differential privacy, a cryptographically-inspired privacy formalism, that provides a rigorous, generic, and flexible foundation for defense.",

A promising direction would be to use a single holistic universal model, as a “foundation”, that targets all modalities at once-a true vision and language foundation model should be good at vision tasks, language tasks, and cross- and multi-modal vision and language tasks. We introduce FLAVA as such a model and demonstrate impressive performance on a wide range of 35 tasks spanning these target modalities.",

        "abstract": "With the desire to model population genetic processes under increasingly realistic scenarios, forward genetic simulations have become a critical part of the toolbox of modern evolutionary biology. The SLiM forward genetic simulation framework is one of the most powerful and widely used tools in this area. However, its foundation in the Wright–Fisher model has been found to pose an obstacle to implementing many types of models; it is difficult to adapt the Wright–Fisher model, with its many assumptions, to modeling ecologically realistic scenarios such as explicit space, overlapping generations, individual variation in reproduction, density-dependent population regulation, individual variation in dispersal or migration, local extinction and recolonization, mating between subpopulations, age structure, fitness-based survival and hard selection, emergent sex ratios, and so forth. In response to this need, we here introduce SLiM 3, which contains two key advancements aimed at abolishing these limitations. First, the new non-Wright–Fisher or “nonWF” model type provides a much more flexible foundation that allows the easy implementation of all of the above scenarios and many more. Second, SLiM 3 adds support for continuous space, including spatial interactions and spatial maps of environmental variables. We provide a conceptual overview of these new features, and present several example models to illustrate their use. These two key features allow SLiM 3 models to go beyond the Wright–Fisher model, opening up new horizons for forward genetic modeling.",

        "abstract": "Data saturation is the most commonly employed concept for estimating sample sizes in qualitative research. Over the past 20 years, scholars using both empirical research and mathematical/statistical models have made significant contributions to the question: How many qualitative interviews are enough? This body of work has advanced the evidence base for sample size estimation in qualitative inquiry during the design phase of a study, prior to data collection, but it does not provide qualitative researchers with a simple and reliable way to determine the adequacy of sample sizes during and/or after data collection. Using the principle of saturation as a foundation, we describe and validate a simple-to-apply method for assessing and reporting on saturation in the context of inductive thematic analyses. Following a review of the empirical research on data saturation and sample size estimation in qualitative research, we propose an alternative way to evaluate saturation that overcomes the shortcomings and challenges associated with existing methods identified in our review. Our approach includes three primary elements in its calculation and assessment: Base Size, Run Length, and New Information Threshold. We additionally propose a more flexible approach to reporting saturation. To validate our method, we use a bootstrapping technique on three existing thematically coded qualitative datasets generated from in-depth interviews. Results from this analysis indicate the method we propose to assess and report on saturation is feasible and congruent with findings from earlier studies.",

These tools provide a promising direction in the studies where data availability is limited. One common issue in GANs is that the density of the learned generative distribution could concentrate on the training data points, meaning that they can easily remember training samples due to the high model complexity of deep networks. This becomes a major concern when GANs are applied to private or sensitive data such as patient medical records, and the concentration of distribution may divulge critical patient information. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a differentially private GAN (DPGAN) model, in which we achieve differential privacy in GANs by adding carefully designed noise to gradients during the learning procedure. We provide rigorous proof for the privacy guarantee, as well as comprehensive empirical evidence to support our analysis, where we demonstrate that our method can generate high quality data points at a reasonable privacy level.",

The extracellular matrix (ECM) within the cell microenvironment serves not only as a structural foundation for cells but also as a source of three-dimensional (3D) biochemical and biophysical cues that trigger and regulate cell behaviors. Increasing evidence suggests that the 3D character of the microenvironment is required for development of many critical cell responses observed in vivo, fueling a surge in the development of functional and biomimetic materials for engineering the 3D cell microenvironment. Progress in the design of such materials has improved control of cell behaviors in 3D and advanced the fields of tissue regeneration, in vitro tissue models, large-scale cell differentiation, immunotherapy, and gene therapy. However, the field is still in its infancy, and discoveries about the nature of cell-microenvironment interactions continue to overturn much early progress in the field. Key challenges continue to be dissecting the roles of chemistry, structure, mechanics, and electrophysiology in the cell microenvironment, and understanding and harnessing the roles of periodicity and drift in these factors. This review encapsulates where recent advances appear to leave the ever-shifting state of the art, and it highlights areas in which substantial potential and uncertainty remain.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a large-scale detailed 3D face dataset, FaceScape, and propose a novel algorithm that is able to predict elaborate riggable 3D face models from a single image input. FaceScape dataset provides 18,760 textured 3D faces, captured from 938 subjects and each with 20 specific expressions. The 3D models contain the pore-level facial geometry that is also processed to be topologically uniformed. These fine 3D facial models can be represented as a 3D morphable model for rough shapes and displacement maps for detailed geometry. Taking advantage of the large-scale and high-accuracy dataset, a novel algorithm is further proposed to learn the expression-specific dynamic details using a deep neural network. The learned relationship serves as the foundation of our 3D face prediction system from a single image input. Different than the previous methods, our predicted 3D models are riggable with highly detailed geometry under different expressions. The unprecedented dataset and code will be released to public for research purpose.",

        "abstract": "This work documents the first version of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) new Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SMv1). We focus on the standard resolution of the fully coupled physical model designed to address DOE mission‐relevant water cycle questions. Its components include atmosphere and land (110‐km grid spacing), ocean and sea ice (60 km in the midlatitudes and 30 km at the equator and poles), and river transport (55 km) models. This base configuration will also serve as a foundation for additional configurations exploring higher horizontal resolution as well as augmented capabilities in the form of biogeochemistry and cryosphere configurations. The performance of E3SMv1 is evaluated by means of a standard set of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Characterization of Klima simulations consisting of a long preindustrial control, historical simulations (ensembles of fully coupled and prescribed SSTs) as well as idealized CO2 forcing simulations. The model performs well overall with biases typical of other CMIP‐class models, although the simulated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is weaker than many CMIP‐class models. While the E3SMv1 historical ensemble captures the bulk of the observed warming between preindustrial (1850) and present day, the trajectory of the warming diverges from observations in the second half of the twentieth century with a period of delayed warming followed by an excessive warming trend. Using a two‐layer energy balance model, we attribute this divergence to the model's strong aerosol‐related effective radiative forcing (ERFari+aci = −1.65 W/m2) and high equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS = 5.3 K).",

        "abstract": "Although current salient object detection (SOD) works have achieved significant progress, they are limited when it comes to the integrity of the predicted salient regions. We define the concept of integrity at both a micro and macro level. Specifically, at the micro level, the model should highlight all parts that belong to a certain salient object. Meanwhile, at the macro level, the model needs to discover all salient objects in a given image. To facilitate integrity learning for SOD, we design a novel <bold>I</bold>ntegrity <bold>Co</bold>gnition <bold>N</bold>etwork (<italic>ICON</italic>), which explores three important components for learning strong integrity features. 1) Unlike existing models, which focus more on feature discriminability, we introduce a diverse feature aggregation (DFA) component to aggregate features with various receptive fields (i.e., kernel shape and context) and increase feature diversity. Such diversity is the foundation for mining the integral salient objects. 2) Based on the DFA features, we introduce an integrity channel enhancement (ICE) component with the goal of enhancing feature channels that highlight the integral salient objects, while suppressing the other distracting ones. 3) After extracting the enhanced features, the part-whole verification (PWV) method is employed to determine whether the part and whole object features have strong agreement. Such part-whole agreements can further improve the micro-level integrity for each salient object. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our ICON, comprehensive experiments are conducted on seven challenging benchmarks. Our ICON outperforms the baseline methods in terms of a wide range of metrics. Notably, our ICON achieves <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"zhang-ieq1-3179526.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>10% relative improvement over the previous best model in terms of average false negative ratio (FNR), on six datasets.

We begin with the formal definition of AutoML and then introduce its principles, including the bi-level learning objective, the learning strategy, and the theoretical interpretation. Then, we summarize the AutoML practices by setting up the taxonomy of existing works based on three main factors: the search space, the search algorithm, and the evaluation strategy. Each category is also explained with the representative methods. Then, we illustrate the principles and practices with exemplary applications from configuring ML pipeline, one-shot neural architecture search, and integration with foundation models.

Blockchain is recently introduced and revolutionizing the digital world bringing a new perspective to security, resiliency and efficiency of systems. While initially popularized by Bitcoin, Blockchain is much more than a foundation for crypto currency. It offers a secure way to exchange any kind of good, service, or transaction. Industrial growth increasingly depends on trusted partnerships; but increasing regulation, cybercrime and fraud are inhibiting expansion. To address these challenges, Blockchain will enable more agile value chains, faster product innovations, closer customer relationships, and quicker integration with the IoT and cloud technology. Further Blockchain provides a lower cost of trade with a trusted contract monitored without intervention from third parties who may not add direct value. It facilitates smart contracts, engagements, and agreements with inherent, robust cyber security features. This paper is an effort to break the ground for presenting and demonstrating the use of Blockchain technology in multiple industrial applications. A healthcare industry application, Healthchain, is formalized and developed on the foundation of Blockchain using IBM Blockchain initiative. The concepts are transferable to a wide range of industries as finance, government and manufacturing where security, scalability and efficiency must meet.",

So far, however, it is largely unclear why the learned representations generalize so effectively to a large variety of downstream tasks. We here prove that feedforward models trained with objectives belonging to the commonly used InfoNCE family learn to implicitly invert the underlying generative model of the observed data. While the proofs make certain statistical assumptions about the generative model, we observe empirically that our findings hold even if these assumptions are severely violated. Our theory highlights a fundamental connection between contrastive learning, generative modeling, and nonlinear independent component analysis, thereby furthering our understanding of the learned representations as well as providing a theoretical foundation to derive more effective contrastive losses.",

        "abstract": "We present a formulation of deep learning that aims at producing a large margin classifier. The notion of margin, minimum distance to a decision boundary, has served as the foundation of several theoretically profound and empirically successful results for both classification and regression tasks. However, most large margin algorithms are applicable only to shallow models with a preset feature representation; and conventional margin methods for neural networks only enforce margin at the output layer. Such methods are therefore not well suited for deep networks. \nIn this work, we propose a novel loss function to impose a margin on any chosen set of layers of a deep network (including input and hidden layers). Our formulation allows choosing any norm on the metric measuring the margin. We demonstrate that the decision boundary obtained by our loss has nice properties compared to standard classification loss functions. Specifically, we show improved empirical results on the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets on multiple tasks: generalization from small training sets, corrupted labels, and robustness against adversarial perturbations. The resulting loss is general and complementary to existing data augmentation (such as random/adversarial input transform) and regularization techniques (such as weight decay, dropout, and batch norm).",

We compare our method against ten baselines using three different metrics on VGG-16 and ResNet-50, and find that our methods outperform all baselines in five out of six settings.

However, labelling data is difficult and there often are diverse valid beliefs about what the correct data labels should be. So far, dataset creators have acknowledged annotator subjectivity, but rarely actively managed it in the annotation process. This has led to partly-subjective datasets that fail to serve a clear downstream use. To address this issue, we propose two contrasting paradigms for data annotation. The descriptive paradigm encourages annotator subjectivity, whereas the prescriptive paradigm discourages it. Descriptive annotation allows for the surveying and modelling of different beliefs, whereas prescriptive annotation enables the training of models that consistently apply one belief. We discuss benefits and challenges in implementing both paradigms, and argue that dataset creators should explicitly aim for one or the other to facilitate the intended use of their dataset. Lastly, we conduct an annotation experiment using hate speech data that illustrates the contrast between the two paradigms.",

There are a number of techniques to represent and organize data gleaned from these cohorts, many using ideas implicitly or explicitly borrowed from graph based models.

        "abstract": "Many modern machine learning models are trained to achieve zero or near-zero training error in order to obtain near-optimal (but non-zero) test error. This phenomenon of strong generalization performance for \"overfitted\" / interpolated classifiers appears to be ubiquitous in high-dimensional data, having been observed in deep networks, kernel machines, boosting and random forests. Their performance is consistently robust even when the data contain large amounts of label noise. \nVery little theory is available to explain these observations. The vast majority of theoretical analyses of generalization allows for interpolation only when there is little or no label noise. This paper takes a step toward a theoretical foundation for interpolated classifiers by analyzing local interpolating schemes, including geometric simplicial interpolation algorithm and singularly weighted $k$-nearest neighbor schemes. Consistency or near-consistency is proved for these schemes in classification and regression problems. Moreover, the nearest neighbor schemes exhibit optimal rates under some standard statistical assumptions. \nFinally, this paper suggests a way to explain the phenomenon of adversarial examples, which are seemingly ubiquitous in modern machine learning, and also discusses some connections to kernel machines and random forests in the interpolated regime.",

        "abstract": "We study the ability of foundation models to learn representations for classification that are transferable to new, unseen classes. Recent results in the literature show that representations learned by a single classifier over many classes are competitive on few-shot learning problems with representations learned by special-purpose algorithms designed for such problems. In this paper we provide an explanation for this behavior based on the recently observed phenomenon that the features learned by overparameterized classification networks show an interesting clustering property, called neural collapse. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that neural collapse generalizes to new samples from the training classes, and -- more importantly -- to new classes as well, allowing foundation models to provide feature maps that work well in transfer learning and, specifically, in the few-shot setting.",

        "abstract": "CLIP yielded impressive results on zero-shot transfer learning tasks and is considered as a foundation model like BERT or GPT3. CLIP vision models that have a rich representation are pre-trained using the InfoNCE objective and natural language supervision before they are fine-tuned on particular tasks. Though CLIP excels at zero-shot transfer learning, it suffers from an explaining away problem, that is, it focuses on one or few features, while neglecting other relevant features. This problem is caused by insufficiently extracting the covariance structure in the original multi-modal data. We suggest to use modern Hopfield networks to tackle the problem of explaining away. Their retrieved embeddings have an enriched covariance structure derived from co-occurrences of features in the stored embeddings. However, modern Hopfield networks increase the saturation effect of the InfoNCE objective which hampers learning. We propose to use the InfoLOOB objective to mitigate this saturation effect. We introduce the novel\"Contrastive Leave One Out Boost\"(CLOOB), which uses modern Hopfield networks for covariance enrichment together with the InfoLOOB objective. In experiments we compare CLOOB to CLIP after pre-training on the Conceptual Captions and the YFCC dataset with respect to their zero-shot transfer learning performance on other datasets. CLOOB consistently outperforms CLIP at zero-shot transfer learning across all considered architectures and datasets.",

        "abstract": "Representation learning with small labeled data have emerged in many problems, since the success of deep neural networks often relies on the availability of a huge amount of labeled data that is expensive to collect. To address it, many efforts have been made on training sophisticated models with few labeled data in an unsupervised and semi-supervised fashion. In this paper, we will review the recent progresses on these two major categories of methods. A wide spectrum of models will be categorized in a big picture, where we will show how they interplay with each other to motivate explorations of new ideas. We will review the principles of learning the transformation equivariant, disentangled, self-supervised and semi-supervised representations, all of which underpin the foundation of recent progresses. Many implementations of unsupervised and semi-supervised generative models have been developed on the basis of these criteria, greatly expanding the territory of existing autoencoders, generative adversarial nets (GANs) and other deep networks by exploring the distribution of unlabeled data for more powerful representations. We will discuss emerging topics by revealing the intrinsic connections between unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, and propose in future directions to bridge the algorithmic and theoretical gap between transformation equivariance for unsupervised learning and supervised invariance for supervised learning, and unify unsupervised pretraining and supervised finetuning. We will also provide a broader outlook of future directions to unify transformation and instance equivariances for representation learning, connect unsupervised and semi-supervised augmentations, and explore the role of the self-supervised regularization for many learning problems.",

Related work has investigated learning dashboards, yet none have explored the theoretical foundation that should inform the design and evaluation of such interventions. In this systematic literature review, we analyse the extent to which theories and models from learning sciences have been integrated into the development of learning dashboards aimed at learners. Our analysis revealed that very few dashboard evaluations take into account the educational concepts that were used as a theoretical foundation for their design. Furthermore, we report findings suggesting that comparison with peers, a common reference frame for contextualising information on learning analytics dashboards, was not perceived positively by all learners.

However, machine learning algorithms require access to the raw data which is often privacy sensitive and can create potential security and privacy risks. To address this issue, we present CryptoDL, a framework that develops new techniques to provide solutions for applying deep neural network algorithms to encrypted data. In this paper, we provide the theoretical foundation for implementing deep neural network algorithms in encrypted domain and develop techniques to adopt neural networks within practical limitations of current homomorphic encryption schemes. We show that it is feasible and practical to train neural networks using encrypted data and to make encrypted predictions, and also return the predictions in an encrypted form.

The Shapley framework for explainability has strength in its general applicability combined with its precise, rigorous foundation: it provides a common, model-agnostic language for AI explainability and uniquely satisfies a set of intuitive mathematical axioms. However, Shapley values are too restrictive in one significant regard: they ignore all causal structure in the data. We introduce a less restrictive framework, Asymmetric Shapley values (ASVs), which are rigorously founded on a set of axioms, applicable to any AI system, and flexible enough to incorporate any causal structure known to be respected by the data. We demonstrate that ASVs can (i) improve model explanations by incorporating causal information, (ii) provide an unambiguous test for unfair discrimination in model predictions, (iii) enable sequentially incremental explanations in time-series models, and (iv) support feature-selection studies without the need for model retraining.",

        "abstract": "Predictive modelling of mineral prospectivity, a critical, but challenging procedure for delineation of undiscovered prospective targets in mineral exploration, has been spurred by recent advancements of spatial modelling techniques and machine learning algorithms. In this study, a set of machine learning methods, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN), were employed to conduct a data-driven W prospectivity modelling of the southern Jiangxi Province, China. A total of 118 known W occurrences derived from long-term exploration of this brownfield area and eight evidential layers of multi-source geoscience information related to W mineralization constituted the input datasets. This provided a data-rich foundation for training machine learning models. The optimal configuration of model parameters was trained by a grid search procedure and validated by 10-fold cross-validation. The resulting predictive models were comprehensively assessed by a confusion matrix, receiver operating characteristic curve, and success-rate curve. The modelling results indicate that the CNN model achieves the best classification performance with an accuracy of 92.38%, followed by the RF model (87.62%). In contrast, the RF model outperforms the rest of ML models in overall predictive performance and predictive efficiency. This is characterized by the highest value of area under the curve and the steepest slope of success-rate curve. The RF model was chosen as the optimal model for mineral prospectivity in this region as it is the best predictor. The prospective zones delineated by the prospectivity map occupy 9% of the study area and capture 66.95% of the known mineral occurrences. The geological interpretation of the model reveals that previously neglected Mn anomalies are significant indicators. This implies that enrichment of ore-forming material in the host rocks may play an important role in the formation process of wolframite and can represent an innovative exploration criterion for further exploration in this area.",

Although many animal models have been developed to study this disease, each model presents its own advantages and caveats. A unique model has arisen to study the role of alpha-synuclein (aSyn) in the pathogenesis of PD. This model involves the conversion of recombinant monomeric aSyn protein to a fibrillar form—the aSyn pre-formed fibril (aSyn PFF)—which is then injected into the brain or introduced to the media in culture. Although many groups have successfully adopted and replicated the aSyn PFF model, issues with generating consistent pathology have been reported by investigators. To improve the replicability of this model and diminish these issues, The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research (MJFF) has enlisted the help of field leaders who performed key experiments to establish the aSyn PFF model to provide the research community with guidelines and practical tips for improving the robustness and success of this model. Specifically, we identify key pitfalls and suggestions for avoiding these mistakes as they relate to generating the aSyn PFFs from monomeric protein, validating the formation of pathogenic aSyn PFFs, and using the aSyn PFFs in vivo or in vitro to model PD. With this additional information, adoption and use of the aSyn PFF model should present fewer challenges, resulting in a robust and widely available model of PD.",

We show the prevalence of negative transfer in a computational chemistry case study with 128 tasks and introduce a framework that provides a foundation for reducing negative transfer in multitask models. Our Loss-Balanced Task Weighting approach dynamically updates task weights during model training to control the influence of individual tasks.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mitochondria are organelles with vital functions in almost all eukaryotic cells. Often described as the cellular ‘powerhouses’ due to their essential role in aerobic oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondria perform many other essential functions beyond energy production. As signaling organelles, mitochondria communicate with the nucleus and other organelles to help maintain cellular homeostasis, allow cellular adaptation to diverse stresses, and help steer cell fate decisions during development. Mitochondria have taken center stage in the research of normal and pathological processes, including normal tissue homeostasis and metabolism, neurodegeneration, immunity and infectious diseases. The central role that mitochondria assume within cells is evidenced by the broad impact of mitochondrial diseases, caused by defects in either mitochondrial or nuclear genes encoding for mitochondrial proteins, on different organ systems. In this Review, we will provide the reader with a foundation of the mitochondrial ‘hardware’, the mitochondrion itself, with its specific dynamics, quality control mechanisms and cross-organelle communication, including its roles as a driver of an innate immune response, all with a focus on development, disease and aging. We will further discuss how mitochondrial DNA is inherited, how its mutation affects cell and organismal fitness, and current therapeutic approaches for mitochondrial diseases in both model organisms and humans.",

        "abstract": "Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an effective treatment option for relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), but its therapeutic mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. A better understanding of its mechanism will allow for the development of assays to monitor its clinical efficacy and safety in patients, as well as guide the development of the next generation of therapies for MS. In order to build the foundation for determining its mechanism, we reviewed the manner in which DMF alters lymphocyte subsets in MS patients, its impact on clinical efficacy and safety, as well as its molecular effects in cellular and animal models. DMF decreases absolute lymphocyte counts, but does not affect all subsets uniformly. CD8+ T-cells are the most profoundly affected, but reduction also occurs in the CD4+ population, particularly within the pro-inflammatory T-helper Th1 and Th17 subsets, creating a bias toward more anti-inflammatory Th2 and regulatory subsets. Similarly, B-lymphocyte, myeloid, and natural killer populations are also shifted toward a more anti-inflammatory state. In vitro and animal models demonstrate a role for DMF within the central nervous system (CNS) in promoting neuronal survival in an Nrf2 pathway-dependent manner. However, the impact of DMF directly within the CNS of MS patients remains largely unknown.",

This nascent field of 'polyploid phylogenetics' allows researchers to tackle long-standing questions of polyploid macroevolution, supplies the foundation for mechanistic models of ploidy change, and provides the opportunity to include a more complete and representative sample of plant taxa in our analyses in general.",

The effective properties of the nano-beam vary according to power-law and symmetric sigmoid distributions. Three models of the hygro-thermal loading are employed. The effect of the small scale effect is considered by using the nonlocal theory of Eringen.

Several numerical results are presented thereafter to illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the actual integral Timoshenko beam theory. The effects of the various parameters influencing the vibrational responses of the P-FG and SS-FG nano-beam are also examined and discussed in detail.",

        "abstract": "Many experts and scholars at home and abroad have studied this topic in depth, laying a solid foundation for the research of financial market prediction. At present, the mainstream prediction method is to use neural network and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity to build models, which is a more scientific way, and also verified the feasibility of the way in many studies. In order to improve the accuracy of financial market trend prediction, this paper studies in detail the neural network system represented by BP and the autoregressive conditional heterogeneous variance model represented by GARCH. Analyze its structure and algorithm, combine the advantages of both, create a GARCH-BP model, and transform its combination structure and optimize the algorithm according to the uniqueness of the financial market, so as to meet the market as much as possible Characteristics. The novelty of this paper is the construction of the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model, which lays the foundation for the prediction of financial market trends through the construction of the model. However, there are some shortcomings in this article. The overall overview of the financial market is not very clear, and the prediction of the BP network is not so comprehensive. Finally, through the actual data statistics of market transactions, the effectiveness of the GARCH-BP model was tested, analyzed and researched. The final results show that model has a good effect on the prediction and trend analysis of market, and its accuracy and availability greatly improved compared with the previous conventional approach, which is worth further study and extensive research It is believed that the financial market prediction model will become one of the mainstream tools in the industry after its later improvement.",

The developed model contains only four unknowns variable which is reduced compared to other HSDTs models.

Numerical outcomes of bending analysis of FG plates under hygro-thermo-mechanical loads are performed and compared with those available in the literature.

Existing self-supervised denoising frameworks are mostly built upon the same theoretical foundation, where the denoising models are required to be J-invariant. However, our analyses indicate that the current theory and the J-invariance may lead to denoising models with reduced performance. In this work, we introduce Noise2Same, a novel self-supervised denoising framework. In Noise2Same, a new self-supervised loss is proposed by deriving a self-supervised upper bound of the typical supervised loss. In particular, Noise2Same requires neither J-invariance nor extra information about the noise model and can be used in a wider range of denoising applications. We analyze our proposed Noise2Same both theoretically and experimentally. The experimental results show that our Noise2Same remarkably outperforms previous self-supervised denoising methods in terms of denoising performance and training efficiency.

Given such a clear goal for a process that has been the focus of ecological research for decades, there is surprisingly little consensus on how to measure competitive ability, with up to 50 different metrics currently proposed. Using competitive population dynamics as a foundation, we define competitive ability—the ability of one species to exclude another—using quantitative theoretical models of population dynamics to isolate the key parameters that are known to predict competitive outcomes. Based on the definition of competitive ability we identify the empirical requirements and describe straightforward methods for quantifying competitive ability in future empirical studies. In doing so, our analysis also allows us to identify why many existing approaches to studying competition are unsuitable for quantifying competitive ability. Synthesis. Competitive ability is precisely defined starting from models of competitive population dynamics. Quantifying competitive ability in a theoretically justified manner is straightforward using experimental designs readily applied to studies of competition in the laboratory and field.",

However, generating adequate labels for these structures is a critical barrier, given the time and effort required from pathologists. Results This article describes a novel collaborative framework for engaging crowds of medical students and pathologists to produce quality labels for cell nuclei. We used this approach to produce the NuCLS dataset, containing >220,000 annotations of cell nuclei in breast cancers. This builds on prior work labeling tissue regions to produce an integrated tissue region- and cell-level annotation dataset for training that is the largest such resource for multi-scale analysis of breast cancer histology. This article presents data and analysis results for single and multi-rater annotations from both non-experts and pathologists. We present a novel workflow that uses algorithmic suggestions to collect accurate segmentation data without the need for laborious manual tracing of nuclei. Our results indicate that even noisy algorithmic suggestions do not adversely affect pathologist accuracy and can help non-experts improve annotation quality. We also present a new approach for inferring truth from multiple raters and show that non-experts can produce accurate annotations for visually distinctive classes. Conclusions This study is the most extensive systematic exploration of the large-scale use of wisdom-of-the-crowd approaches to generate data for computational pathology applications.",

        "abstract": "The development of a smart city and digital twin requires the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), where BIM models are to be integrated into GIS for visualization and/or analysis. However, the intrinsic differences between BIM and GIS have led to enormous problems in BIM-to-GIS data conversion, and the use of City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) has further escalated this issue. This study aims to facilitate the use of BIM models in GIS by proposing using the shapefile format, and a creative approach for converting Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to shapefile was developed by integrating a computer graphics technique. Thirteen building models were used to validate the proposed method. The result shows that: (1) the IFC-to-shapefile conversion is easier and more flexible to realize than the IFC-to-CityGML conversion, and (2) the computer graphics technique can improve the efficiency and reliability of BIM-to-GIS data conversion. This study can facilitate the use of BIM information in GIS and benefit studies working on digital twins and smart cities where building models are to be processed and integrated in GIS, or any other studies that need to manipulate IFC geometry in depth.",

In this study, a novel hybrid soft computing model (RF-PSO) of random forest (RF) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) was developed and used to estimate the undrained shear strength of soil based on the clay content (%), moisture content (%), specific gravity (%), void ratio (%), liquid limit (%), and plastic limit (%). In this study, the experimental results of 127 soil samples from national highway project Hai Phong-Thai Binh of Vietnam were used to generate datasets for training and validating models. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) method was used to evaluate and compare performance of the proposed model with single RF model. The results show that the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) achieved a high accuracy performance (R = 0.89) in the prediction of shear strength of soil. Validation of the models also indicated that RF-PSO model (R = 0.89 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.453) is superior to the single RF model without optimization (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 0.48). Thus, the proposed hybrid model (RF-PSO) can be used for accurate estimation of shear strength which can be used for the suitable designing of civil engineering structures.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning models are at the foundation of modern society. Accounts of unfair models penalizing subgroups of a population have been reported in domains including law enforcement, job screening, etc. Unfairness can spur from biases in the training data, as well as from class imbalance, i.e., when a sensitive group's data is not sufficiently represented. Under such settings, balancing techniques are commonly used to achieve better prediction performance, but their effects on model fairness are largely unknown. In this paper, we first illustrate the extent to which common balancing techniques exacerbate unfairness in real-world data. Then, we propose a new method, called fair class balancing, that allows to enhance model fairness without using any information about sensitive attributes. We show that our method can achieve accurate prediction performance while concurrently improving fairness.",

        "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) is a difficult transfer learning problem aiming to learn a generalizable model for unseen domains. Recent foundation models (FMs) are robust to many distribution shifts and, therefore, should substantially improve the performance of DG. In this work, we study generic ways to adopt CLIP, a Visual-Language Foundation Model, for DG problems in image classification. While ERM greatly improves the accuracy with bigger backbones and training datasets using standard DG benchmarks, fine-tuning FMs is not practical in many real-world situations. We propose Domain Prompt Learning (DPL) as a novel approach for domain inference in the form of conditional prompt generation. DPL achieved a significant accuracy improvement with only training a lightweight prompt generator (a three-layer MLP), whose parameter is of equivalent scale to the classification projector in the previous DG literature. Combining \\dplshort~with CLIP provides surprising performance, raising the accuracy of zero-shot CLIP from 73.7% to 79.3% on several standard datasets, namely PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and TerraIncognita. We hope the simplicity and success of our approach lead to broader adoption and analysis of foundation models in the domain generalization field.

        "abstract": "Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms with probabilistic dynamical models are amongst the most data-efficient learning methods. This is often attributed to their ability to distinguish between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. However, while most algorithms distinguish these two uncertainties for {\\em learning} the model, they ignore it when {\\em optimizing} the policy. In this paper, we show that ignoring the epistemic uncertainty leads to greedy algorithms that do not explore sufficiently. In turn, we propose a {\\em practical optimistic-exploration algorithm} (\\alg), which enlarges the input space with {\\em hallucinated} inputs that can exert as much control as the {\\em epistemic} uncertainty in the model affords. We analyze this setting and construct a general regret bound for well-calibrated models, which is provably sublinear in the case of Gaussian Process models. Based on this theoretical foundation, we show how optimistic exploration can be easily combined with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms and different probabilistic models. Our experiments demonstrate that optimistic exploration significantly speeds up learning when there are penalties on actions, a setting that is notoriously difficult for existing model-based reinforcement learning algorithms.",

In this context, the present study proposes and tests a conceptual model on consumers acceptance of recycled goods through PLS Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), based on the data obtained from 312 respondents. Results indicate that the positive image of circular products is the most important driver of consumers’ acceptance, followed by the product perceived safety.

While the behavior of SGD is well understood in the convex learning setting, the existing theoretical results for SGD applied to nonconvex objective functions are far from mature. For example, existing results require to impose a nontrivial assumption on the uniform boundedness of gradients for all iterates encountered in the learning process, which is hard to verify in practical implementations. In this article, we establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for SGD in nonconvex learning by showing that this boundedness assumption can be removed without affecting convergence rates, and relaxing the standard smoothness assumption to Hölder continuity of gradients. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for almost sure convergence as well as optimal convergence rates for SGD applied to both general nonconvex and gradient-dominated objective functions. A linear convergence is further derived in the case with zero variances.",

        "abstract": "The integration of building information modeling (BIM) and geographic information system (GIS) is attracting more attention than ever due to its potential benefits for both the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) domain and the geospatial industry. The main challenge in BIM and GIS integrated application comes from the fundamental data conversion, especially for the geometric information. BIM and GIS use different modeling paradigms to represent objects. The BIM dataset takes, for example, Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) that use solid models, such as boundary representation (B-Rep), swept solid, constructive solid geometry (CSG), and clipping, while the GIS dataset mainly uses surface models or B-Rep. The fundamental data conversion between BIM and GIS is the foundation of BIM and GIS integrated application. However, the efficiency of data conversion has been greatly impaired by the human intervention needed, especially for the conversion of the clipping geometry. The goal of this study is to automate the conversion of IFC clipping representation into the shapefile format. A process-level approach was developed with an algorithm for instantiating unbounded half spaces using B-Rep. Four IFC models were used to validate the proposed method. The results show that (1) the proposed approach can successfully automate the conversion of IFC clipping representation into the shapefile format; and (2) increasing boundary size has no effect on the file size of unbounded half spaces, but slightly increases the producing time of half spaces and processing time of building components. The efficiency of this study can be further improved by using an open-source package, instead of using the low-efficiency packages provided by ArcGIS.",

        "abstract": "Laser scanning is an effective tool for acquiring geometric attributes of trees and vegetation, which lays a solid foundation for 3-dimensional tree modeling. Existing studies on tree modeling from laser scanning data are vast. However, some works cannot guarantee sufficient modeling accuracy, while some other works are mainly rule-based and therefore highly depend on user inputs. In this paper, we propose a novel method to accurately and automatically reconstruct detailed 3D tree models from laser scans. We first extract an initial tree skeleton from the input point cloud by establishing a minimum spanning tree using the Dijkstra shortest-path algorithm. Then, the initial tree skeleton is pruned by iteratively removing redundant components. After that, an optimization-based approach is performed to fit a sequence of cylinders to approximate the geometry of the tree branches. Experiments on various types of trees from different data sources demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. The overall fitting error (i.e., the distance between the input points and the output model) is less than 10 cm. The reconstructed tree models can be further applied in the precise estimation of tree attributes, urban landscape visualization, etc. The source code of this work is freely available at https://github.com/tudelft3d/adtree.",

        "abstract": "Abstract It is necessary to study the seismic problem of buildings and structures for various safety reasons. Such as prevent and to reduce the damage caused by earthquakes to the greatest extent possible, research feasible analysis methods, and simulate the performance of the structure under earthquake action by computer, to keep its design performance in future earthquake action, and to ensure the safety of people's lives and property. The seismic design based on nonlinear vibration control is proposed. SAP2000 structure analysis software is used to establish the seismic structure model, foundation isolation model, and floor isolation model of a 15-story large chassis frame structure, the nonlinear time-history analysis of the three models under the action of multiple and rare earthquakes is carried out, and the period, displacement and acceleration of the isolated structure and the aseismatic structure are compared. The results show that, under the action of multiple earthquakes, the base shear of foundation isolation is 1208.06 kN, and the floor isolation is 926.43 kN, which are 0.37 and 0.3 of the base shears of the aseismatic structure, respectively. Under the action of rare earthquakes, the base-isolation shear is 4039.59 kN, and the story isolation shear is 3119.99 kN, which are, respectively, 0.4 and 0.31 of the base-isolation shears of the aseismatic structure. This method provides a reliable evaluation for nonlinear seismic response analysis of large complex high-rise buildings and provides an effective reference.",

While well-being research is growing, there is a need to translate theoretical concepts into practical models for measurement and action. Methods: Multidisciplinary literature reviews informed development of the worker well-being framework and major domains and subdomains. An expert panel helped prioritize constructs for measurement. Results: The framework includes five domains and 20 subdomains and conceptualizes worker well-being as a subjective and objective phenomenon inclusive of experiences both within and beyond work contexts. Conclusion: Well-being is a positive and unifying concept that captures multiple factors that contribute to workers’ health and quality of life. This work lays the foundation for larger well-being measurement efforts and will provide tools for NIOSH partners to help workers flourish.",

Finally, categorizations from 43 documents are integrated into one framework.,Four main dimensions are identified as being used in different contexts to characterize sharing systems and were combined to form one comprehensive typology: shared good or service, market structure, market orientation, and industry sector.,The proposed typology is able to distinguish sharing activities based on their similarities and differences. Social, economic, and communicational avenues for the term “sharing” are merged into a conceptual foundation of the sharing economy. This enables researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to position their projects in the broad field of sharing. By discussing inherent tensions with regard to sustainability of the sharing economy, the offered categorizations can help to guide future research and policy intervention. Last but not least, professional managers should find valuable ideas for new business models.",

A number of recent papers have questioned the necessity of such architectures and found that well-executed, simpler models are quite effective. We show that this is also the case for document classification: in a large-scale reproducibility study of several recent neural models, we find that a simple BiLSTM architecture with appropriate regularization yields accuracy and F1 that are either competitive or exceed the state of the art on four standard benchmark datasets. Surprisingly, our simple model is able to achieve these results without attention mechanisms. While these regularization techniques, borrowed from language modeling, are not novel, to our knowledge we are the first to apply them in this context. Our work provides an open-source platform and the foundation for future work in document classification.",

The map is the result of an extensive, joint effort combining the results obtained from a collection of probabilistic seismic hazard models, called the GEM Mosaic. Together, the map and the underlying database of models provide an up-to-date view of the earthquake threat globally. In addition, using the Mosaic, a synopsis of the current state-of-practice in modeling probabilistic seismic hazard at national and regional scales is possible. The process adopted for the compilation of the Mosaic adhered to the maximum extent possible to GEM’s principles of collaboration, inclusiveness, transparency, and reproducibility. For each region, priority was given to seismic hazard models either developed by well-recognized national agencies or by large collaborative projects involving local scientists. The version of the GEM Mosaic presented herein contains 30 probabilistic seismic hazard models, 14 of which represent national or sub-national models; the remainder are regional-scale models. We discuss the general qualities of these models, the underlying framework of the database, and the outlook for the Mosaic’s utility and its future versions.",

As utility independent private microgrids are installed constantly, standardized interoperability frameworks are required to define behavioral models of the individual agents for expandability and plug-and-play operation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive hybrid agent framework combining the foundation for intelligent physical agents (FIPAs), IEC 61850, and data distribution service (DDS) standards. The IEC 61850 logical node concept is extended using FIPA-based agent communication language with application specific attributes and deliberative behavior modeling capability. The DDS middleware is adopted to enable a real-time publisher-subscriber interoperability mechanism between platforms. The proposed multi-agent framework was validated in a laboratory-based testbed involving developed intelligent electronic device prototypes and actual microgrid setups. Experimental results were demonstrated for both decentralized and distributed control approaches. Secondary and tertiary control levels of a microgrid were demonstrated for decentralized hierarchical control case study. A consensus-based economic dispatch case study was demonstrated as a distributed control example. It was shown that the developed agent platform is industrially applicable for actual smart grid field deployment.",

Here, in five studies, each with large samples (total N = 11,496), we construct and replicate a well-fitting model of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ). In study 1 (N = 2,271) we tested previously theorised models, confirming none provide adequate fit. We then developed a well-fitting model of the MFQ. In this model, the fairness/reciprocity and harm/care foundations were preserved intact. The binding foundations, however, divided into five, rather than the original three foundations. Purity/sanctity split into independent foundations of purity and sanctity. Similarly, Ingroup/loyalty divided into independent factors of loyalty to clan and loyalty to country. Authority/respect was re-focussed on hierarchy, losing one item to the new sanctity foundation and another into loyalty to country. In addition to these 7 foundations, higher-level factors of binding and individualizing were supported, along with a general/acquiescence factor. Finally, a “moral tilt” factor corresponding to coordinated left-leaning vs. right-leaning moral patterns was supported. We validated the model in four additional studies, testing replication of the 7-foundation model in data including from US, Australia, and China (total N = 9,225). The model replicated with good fit found in all four samples. These findings demonstrate the first well-fitting replicable model of the MFQ. They also highlight the importance of modelling measurement structure, and reveal important additional foundations, and structure (binding, individualizing, tilt) above the foundations.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this article, the small-scale effect on the vibration behavior of orthotropic single-layered graphene sheets is studied based on the nonlocal Reddy's plate theory embedded in elastic medium considering initial shear stress. Elastic theory of the graphene sheets is reformulated using the nonlocal differential constitutive relations of Eringen. To simulate the interaction between the graphene sheet and surrounding elastic medium we used both Winkler-type and Pasternak-type foundation models. The effects of initial shear stress and surrounding elastic medium and boundary conditions on the vibration analysis of orthotropic single-layered graphene sheets are studied considering five different boundary conditions. Numerical approach of the obtained equation is derived by differential quadrature method. Effects of shear stress, nonlocal parameter, size of the graphene sheets, stiffness of surrounding elastic medium, and boundary conditions on vibration frequency rate are investigated. The results reveal that as the stiffness of the surrounding elastic medium increases, the nonlocal effect decreases. Further, the nonlocal effect increases as the size of the graphene sheet is decreased. It is also found that the frequency ratios decrease with an increase in vibration modes.",

        "abstract": "Companies are facing manifold challenges while trying to implement Industrie 4.0, which are in great parts rooted in the complexity of Industrie 4.0 and its associated fields of research. To mitigate these challenges and structure Industrie 4.0, initiatives have developed abstract reference architectural models. The research on hand uses the reference architectural model developed by the German Platform Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). This work aims to create a concrete, yet universal, application-oriented model that fosters the widespread of RAMI 4.0 in practice, supports further research and amendments, and hence, facilitates the implementation of Industrie 4.0 in small and medium-sized enterprises by means of an information tool. Finally, the foundation for a subsequent inclusion of IT security in RAMI 4.0 is laid.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Although nearly 10% of Americans suffer from a rare disease, clinical progress in individual rare diseases is severely compromised by lack of attention and research resources compared to common diseases. It is thus imperative to investigate these diseases at their most basic level to build a foundation and provide the opportunity for understanding their mechanisms and phenotypes, as well as potential treatments. One strategy for effectively and efficiently studying rare diseases is using genetically tractable organisms to model the disease and learn about the essential cellular processes affected. Beyond investigating dysfunctional cellular processes, modeling rare diseases in simple organisms presents the opportunity to screen for pharmacological or genetic factors capable of ameliorating disease phenotypes. Among the small model organisms that excel in rare disease modeling is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. With a staggering breadth of research tools, C. elegans provides an ideal system in which to study human disease. Molecular and cellular processes can be easily elucidated, assayed and altered in ways that can be directly translated to humans. When paired with other model organisms and collaborative efforts with clinicians, the power of these C. elegans studies cannot be overstated. This Review highlights studies that have used C. elegans in diverse ways to understand rare diseases and aid in the development of treatments. With continuing and advancing technologies, the capabilities of this small round worm will continue to yield meaningful and clinically relevant information for human health.",

Many experiments in C. elegans begin with the generation and analysis of mutants that affect a specific biological process, so genetic techniques are the foundation of worm research. Many different aspects of biology are being studied in C. elegans, and three different recent Nobel Prizes have recognized six researchers working with worms. In addition, C. elegans was the first multicellular organism to have its genome sequenced, so many of the standard genomic methods have also been pioneered in C. elegans. In fact, many novel techniques and ideas are initially tested in C. elegans because of its versatility as a research organism. It is also appropriate for introducing undergraduate students to research, and some of its strengths and challenges for this purpose are discussed. © 2019 The Authors.",

        "abstract": "The Rothermel surface fire spread model, with some adjustments by Frank A. Albini in 1976, has been used in fire and fuels management systems since 1972. It is generally used with other models including fireline intensity and flame length. Fuel models are often used to define fuel input parameters. Dynamic fuel models use equations for live fuel curing. Models have been developed for the effect of cross-slope wind and for fire spread in directions other than head fire. Equations for the Rothermel model and associated models are presented for easy reference. The influence of input variables on results is examined. While the spread model is used in the U.S. National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS), there are significant differences. The NFDRS equations and fuel models are given. This paper is intended to serve as a reference for those interested in the foundation of wildland fire modeling. System developers will benefit from equations from various sources being in one document. Developers of custom fuel models will find information on the impact of fuel parameters on rate of spread calculations.",

An inclusive information model, the Land Administration Model (LADM ISO 19152) has been developed to provide an international framework for how this can best be done. This conceptual model does not prescribe the technical data format. One existing source from which data could be obtained is 3D Building Information Models (BIMs), or, more specifically in this context, BIMs in the form of one of buildingSMART’s open standards: the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The research followed a standard BIM methodology of first defining the requirements through the use of the Information Delivery Manual (IDM ISO29481) and then translating the process described in the IDM into technical requirements using a Model View Definition (MVD), a practice to coordinate upfront the multidisciplinary stakeholders of a construction project. The proposed process model illustrated how the time it takes to register 3D spatial units in a Land Registry could substantially be reduced compared to the first 3D registration in the Netherlands. The modelling of an MVD or a subset of the IFC data model helped enable the creation and exchange of boundary representations of topological objects capable of being combined into a 3D legal space overview map.",

This transition is often recognized for its electronic properties; however, the concomitant change in optical properties is also attractive. One application is to exploit the optical properties within this transition region to control and tune the refractive index between its insulating and metallic states. To achieve this, we used atomic layer deposition to grow high-quality, low-temperature (≤150°C), ultrathin films of vanadium dioxide on sapphire substrates. Measurements of optical transmittance and reflectance as a function of temperature are then used to create wavelength and temperature dependent models of the complex optical refractive index. Our models create a foundation for developing vanadium dioxide as a tunable refractive index material.",

        "abstract": "Building information modeling (BIM) is a process that has shown great potential in the building industry, but it has not reached the same level of maturity for transportation infrastructure. There is a standardization need for information exchange and management processes in the infrastructure that integrates BIM and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Currently, the Industry Foundation Classes standard has harmonized different infrastructures under the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) 4.3 release. Furthermore, the usage of remote sensing technologies such as laser scanning for infrastructure monitoring is becoming more common. This paper presents a semi-automated framework that takes as input a raw point cloud from a mobile mapping system, and outputs an IFC-compliant file that models the alignment and the centreline of each road lane in a highway road. The point cloud processing methodology is validated for two of its key steps, namely road marking processing and alignment and road line extraction, and a UML diagram is designed for the definition of the alignment entity from the point cloud data.",

        "abstract": "Personalized treatment is defined as choosing the “right treatment for the right person at the right time.” Although psychiatry has not yet reached this level of precision, we are on the way thanks to recent technological developments that may aid to detect plausible molecular and genetic markers. At the moment there are some models that are contributing to precision psychiatry through the concept of staging. While staging was initially presented as a way to categorize patients according to clinical presentation, course, and illness severity, current staging models integrate multiple levels of information that can help to define each patient's characteristics, severity, and prognosis in a more precise and individualized way. Moreover, staging might serve as the foundation to create a clinical decision-making algorithm on the basis of the patient's stage. In this review we will summarize the evolution of the bipolar disorder staging model in relation to the new discoveries on the neurobiology of bipolar disorder. Furthermore, we will discuss how the latest and future progress in psychiatry might transform current staging models into precision staging models.",

It is shown that that protocol maps formally into a dynamic game that is an extension of standard models of R&D racing. The model provides a technical foundation for any economic analysis of ‘proof of work’ protocols. Using the model, we demonstrate that free entry is solely responsible for determining resource usage by the system for a given reward to mining. The endogenous level of computational difficulty built into the Bitcoin protocol does not mitigate this usage and serves only to determine the time taken to process transactions. Regulating market structure will mitigate resource use highlighting the importance of identifying the benefits of competition for the operation of the blockchain.",

Beijing City was selected as a typical region for the case study. Data on the aforementioned variables for the city throughout 2015 were used to construct two regression models, which were discriminated by annual and seasonal data, respectively. The results indicated that the regression model based on annual data had (R2 = 0.766) goodness-of-fit and (R2 = 0.875) cross-validity. However, the regression models based on seasonal data for spring and winter were more effective, achieving 0.852 and 0.874 goodness-of-fit, respectively.

        "abstract": "Traditionally, the one-to-one interaction between heterogeneous software has become the most commonly used method for multi-disciplinary collaboration in building projects, resulting in numerous data interfaces, different data formats, and inefficient collaboration. As the prevalence of Building Information Modeling (BIM) increases in building projects, it is expected that the exchange of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)-based data can smoothly take place between heterogeneous BIM software. However, interoperability issues frequently occur during bidirectional data exchanges using IFC. Hence, a data interoperability experiment, including architectural, structural and MEP models from a practical project, was conducted to analyze these issues in the process of data import and re-export between heterogeneous software. According to the results, the fundamental causes of interoperability issues can be concluded as follows: (a) software tools cannot well interpret several objects belonging to other disciplines due to the difference in domain knowledge; (b) software tools have diverse methods to represent the same geometry, properties and relations, leading to inconsistent model data. Furthermore, this paper presents a suggested method for improving the existing bidirectional data sharing and exchange: BIM software tools export models using IFC format, and these IFC models are imported into a common IFC-based BIM platform for data interoperability.",

        "abstract": "The Singapore Government has embarked on a project to establish a three-dimensional city model and collaborative data platform for Singapore. The research herein contributes to this endeavour by developing a methodology and algorithms to automate the conversion of Building Information Models (BIM), in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data format, into CityGML building models, capturing both geometric and semantic information as available in the BIM models, and including exterior as well as interior structures. We adopt a Triple Graph Grammar (TGG) to formally relate IFC and CityGML, both semantically and geometrically, and to transform a building information model, expressed as an IFC object graph, into a city model expressed as a CityGML object graph. The work pipeline includes extending the CityGML data model with an Application Domain Extension (ADE), which allows capturing information from IFC that is relevant in the geospatial context but at the same time not supported by CityGML in its standard form. In this paper, we elaborate on the triple graph grammar approach and the motivation and roadmap for the development of the ADE. While a fully complete and lossless conversion may never be achieved, this paper suggests that both a TGG and an ADE are natural choices for supporting the conversion between IFC and CityGML.",

        "abstract": "The dynamics of foundation species in ecosystems are key to the fate of many species. Kelp forests are foundation species in temperate ocean ecosystems and contribute to carbon storage, macronutrient dynamics, primary production and biodiversity of a myriad of associated species. Downward trends in their abundance globally have been of concern. We analysed 26 years of aerial censuses (1989–2015) of two canopy kelp species in Washington State (USA) waters. We compared these modern censuses with censuses in 1911 and 1912 to determine the persistence of kelp cover over the past century. Using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, we compared kelp dynamics with likely environmental drivers, including local environmental variables and ocean indices for this region. Kelp remains at historic levels in many areas, although some eastern populations in proximity to greater human populations are the exception to this pattern. Over the last 26 years, kelp abundance showed high spatial autocorrelation in western areas of Straits of Juan de Fuca, with more variable populations in the annual species and eastward towards Puget Sound. Both species covaried positively in their abundance throughout most of the study area, suggesting that environmental factors rather than competition, drove their dynamics. The population dynamics of these kelp species showed that the abundance 1 year previously was an important predictor, and cyclic dynamics were not indicated using ARIMA models. Kelp abundance correlated inversely with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the Oceanic Nino Index, and positively with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation, indicating that large‐scale processes associated with colder seawater temperatures were associated with greater relative abundance of kelp. Synthesis. Kelp beds in the northern California Current Large Marine Ecosystem have mostly remained persistent over the past century and over many kilometres, but some areas may have decreased in abundance. The sensitivity of these populations to indices of ocean climate, our demonstration that a historic 93‐year sea surface temperature record (Race Rocks, Canada) showed a 0.72°C increase and the classification of some areas as high variability‐low abundance, suggest that the viability of these foundational species remain a concern into the future.",

We incorporate Eringen's nonlocal elasticity equations into three plate theories of first order shear deformation theory, higher order shear deformation theory, and classical plate theory. The surrounding elastic media are simulated using Pasternak and Winkler foundation models and their differences are evaluated. The results obtained from different nonlocal plate theories include the values of Winkler and Pasternak modulus parameters, mode numbers, nonlocal parameter, and side lengths of square SLGSs. We show here that axial buckling behavior strongly depends on modulus and nonlocal parameters, which have different values for different mode numbers and side lengths. In addition, we show that in different nonlocal plate theories, nonlocality is more influential in first order shear deformation theory, especially in certain range of nonlocal parameters.",

To make the framework applicable for various scenarios in MAN, we consider the transmitter- and the receiver-oriented node association rules as well as the air-to-ground and air-to-air channel models, which form line of sight links with a location-dependent probability. We then newly analyze the association probability, the main link distance distribution, successful transmission probability (STP), and area spectral efficiency (ASE) of MAN. The upper bounds of the optimal densities that maximize STP and ASE are also provided. Finally, in the numerical results, we show the optimal UAV densities of each AN that maximize the ASE and the STP decrease with the altitude of the network. We also show that when the total UAV density is fixed for two layer AN, the use of single layer in higher(lower) altitude only for all UAVs can achieve better performance for low(high) total density case. Otherwise, distributing UAVs in two layers, i.e., MAN, achieves better performance.",

The no-lag hypothesis is the foundation of many ecophysiological models, correlative species distribution modelling and climate reconstruction approaches. Simple lag hypotheses have become prominent in disequilibrium ecology, proposing that communities track climate change following a fixed function or with a time delay. However, more complex dynamics are possible and may lead to memory effects and alternate unstable states. We develop graphical and analytic methods for assessing these scenarios and show that these dynamics can appear in even simple models. The overall implications are that (1) complex community dynamics may be common and (2) detailed knowledge of past climate change and community states will often be necessary yet sometimes insufficient to make predictions of a community's future state.",

The most recent in situ aerosol measurements presented here show that the concentrations of primary aerosols including sea salt and black carbon drop by factors of 10 to 10,000 from the surface to the upper troposphere. In this study we show that the default convective transport scheme in the National Science Foundation/Department of Energy Community Earth System Model results in a high bias of 10–1,000 times the measured aerosol mass for black carbon and sea salt in the middle and upper troposphere. A modified transport scheme, which considers aerosol activation from entrained air above the cloud base and aerosol‐cloud interaction associated with convection, dramatically improves model agreement with in situ measurements suggesting that deep convection can efficiently remove primary aerosols. We suggest that models that fail to consider secondary activation may overestimate black carbon's radiative forcing by a factor of 2.",

        "abstract": "Rocking isolation of structures is evolving as an alternative design concept in earthquake engineering. The present paper investigates the seismic performance of an actual overpass bridge of the Attiki Odos motorway (Athens, Greece), employing two different concepts of rocking isolation: (a) rocking of the piers on the foundation (rocking piers); and (b) rocking of the pier and foundation assembly (rocking footings) on the soil. The examined bridge is an asymmetric 5-span system having a continuous deck and founded on surface foundations on a deep clay layer. The seismic performance of the two rocking isolated bridges is comparatively assessed to the existing bridge, which is conventionally designed according to current seismic design codes. To that end, 3D numerical models of the bridge–foundation–abutment–soil system are developed, and both static pushover and nonlinear dynamic time history analyses are performed. For the latter, an ensemble of 20 records (10 ground motions of 2 perpendicular components each) that exceed the design level are selected. The conventional system collapses in 5/10 of the (intentionally severe) examined seismic excitations. The rocking piers design alternative survives in 8/10 of the cases examined, with negligible residual deformations. The safety margins of the rocking footings design concept are even larger, as it survives in all cases examined. Both rocking isolation concepts are proven to offer increased levels of seismic resilience, reducing the probability of collapse and the degree of structural damage. Nevertheless, in the rocking piers design alternative high stress concentrations at the rotation pole (pier base) are developed, indicating the need for a special design of the pier ends. This is not the case for the rocking footings concept, which however is subject to increased residual settlements but no residual rotations.",

        "abstract": "The family of languages that builds the foundation of the MEMO method is intended to feature a high degree of inter-language integration. For this purpose, the languages need to share common concepts. In order to define concepts that are semantically equivalent, it is recommendable to use the same meta modelling language for specifying the MEMO modelling languages. The previous version of the meta modelling language used for this purpose needed a revision. At the same time, there was need to account for alternative approaches to specifying modelling languages, especially those offered by the OMG or the Eclipse foundation. This report starts with an analysis of requirements that should be accounted for by a meta modelling language. Subsequently, the UML infrastructure library and meta object facility (MOF) are evaluated against these requirements. In addition to that, the report presents an evaluation of the Ecore model, which serves to represent meta models within the Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF). The evaluation of both approaches shows that none of them is satisfactory as a meta modelling language for enterprise modelling. Then, the new version of the MEMO meta modelling language (MML) is presented. The language specification consists of a meta meta model that specifies that semantics and abstract syntax and a corresponding graphical notation (concrete syntax). The new version features a concept called intrinsic features that allows for differentiating between features that apply to types and those that apply to instances. It also includes a modified graphical notation that supports a clear distinction of meta models from models on other levels of abstraction. Finally, the report presents the outline of a tool that supports the creation and editing of MEMO meta models as well as their transformation into representations which can be used in the Eclipse modelling framework.",

With the advent of ERM, efforts must broaden beyond applying statistical models to quantifiable risks. Other disciplines have expanded ERM research by embracing techniques to investigate risk management practices to produce knowledge that integrates practice and theory. ERM is promoted as integrated risk management, yet silos still remain in both practice and research.,This study provides a foundation and a proposal for moving ERM past academic and organizational silos, which is necessary to achieve the ERM philosophy and increase organizational resilience. Understanding the evolution and fragmented nature of ERM research and practice provides a foundation for interdisciplinary cooperation necessary to achieve the holistic ERM philosophy. A next frontier is effective ERM implementation. This paper argues for an organizational design science approach for mitigating the resistance to change that confounds effective implementation of ERM in organizations facing an increasingly uncertain environment and outlines future research for applying the approach to implementing the ISO 31000 risk management process.",

We next provide conditions under which the resulting belief dynamics resemble either diffusion processes or processes with large jumps. We then demonstrate that the state-contingent choice probabilities predicted by our model are identical to those predicted by a static RI model, providing a micro-foundation for such models. In the diffusion case, our model provides a normative foundation for a variant of the DDM models studied in mathematical psychology.",

A first study of their geometries was performed based on 15 protein structures in 1982. Currently there are about 95 000 protein-ligand structures available in the PDB, providing a solid foundation for a new large-scale statistical analysis. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation of geometric and functional properties of hydrogen bonds. Out of 22 defined functional groups, eight are fully in accordance with theoretical predictions while 14 show variations from expected values.

Bayesian analysis allows combining field data with other information on soil parameters in a consistent manner. We show that the spatial variability of the soil properties and the associated measurements can be captured through two different modelling approaches. In the first approach, a single random variable (RV) represents the soil property within the area of interest, while the second approach models the spatial variability explicitly with a random field (RF). We apply the Bayesian concept exemplarily to the reliability assessment of a shallow foundation in a silty soil with spatially variable data. We show that the simpler RV approach is applicable in cases where the measurements do not influence the correlation structure of the soil property at the vicinity of the foundation. In other cases, it is expected to underestimate the reliability, and a RF model is required to obtain accurate results.",

To overcome this disadvantage, a new full vehicle model is proposed which embraces the view of system modeling and includes the frame flexibility. The model can achieve optimal parameters of the Powertrain Mounting System for isolating the vibration transmitted from the powertrain to the chassis. A model reduction technique, improved reduced system, is used to obtain a reduced model of the frame to represent its original large-scale finite element analysis model for the accessibility of time-efficient solutions of the model. The reduced frame model is integrated with the powertrain mounting and suspension model to form the full dynamic model of the vehicle. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed model are evaluated by its original vehicle model built in software ADAMS and an existing rigid model with rigid foundation. A hybrid model optimization strategy is also presented to tune the dynamic parameters of the powertrain mounts using the developed coupling model. The simulation results show that the proposed coupling model has better representation of the dynamic characteristics of the real vehicle system, and the presented hybrid model optimization strategy can obtain better optimization results compared with the existing rigid model with rigid foundation. In addition, the application of the proposed model can also be extended to the vibration control and the structural fatigue prediction.",

The present article seeks to provide that foundation. It argues that the dual-route models of spelling that underlie much existing research and practice are based on overly simple assumptions about how writing systems work and about how spelling skills develop. Many writing systems include not only context-free links from phonemes to letters but also context-sensitive phonological patterns, morphological influences, and graphotactic patterns. According to an alternative framework, IMP (integration of multiple patterns), spellers acquire multiple sources of information through use of their statistical-learning skills and through direct instruction. Children learn the spelling of a word most easily when different patterns converge on the spelling, and they have difficulty when patterns conflict. Implications of these ideas for assessment and instruction are considered.",

        "abstract": "Gap metric and stability margin have been proven as important model-based analysis tools for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Due to the need for an accurate model, both the gap metric and the optimal stability margin are mostly used for offline analysis. In online analysis, accurate models are rarely available, whereas measurement data could be easily obtained from the systems under consideration. Therefore, in this paper, an approach toward the calculation of the gap metric and the optimal stability margin based on the available measurement data of LTI systems is proposed. A data-driven realization of the so-called stable kernel and stable image representation serves as the foundation of this framework.",

However, other than the developments of the memristive models accounting bulky effects, the achievements on simulating the interfacial memristance are still insufficient. Here we provide a physical model to describe the electrical switching of the memristive interface. It considers the trap-assisted transition between Schottky emission and Fowler-Nordheim tunneling, and successfully reproduces the memristive behaviors occurring on the interface between Bi2S3 nano-networks and F-doped SnO2. Such success not only allows us uncover several features of the memristive interface including the distribution nature of the traps, barrier height/thickness and so on, but also provides a foundation from which we can quantitatively simulate the real interfacial memristor.",

It is the foundation of modern agriculture and, to a large extent, demand for P is met from phosphate rock deposits which are limited and becoming increasingly scarce. Adding an extra stroke to this already desolate picture is the fact that a high percentage of P, through agricultural runoff and waste, makes its way into rivers and oceans leading to eutrophication and collapse of ecosystems. Therefore, there is a critical need to practise P recovery from waste and establish a circular economy applicable to P resources. The potential of microalgae to uptake large quantities of P and use of this P enriched algal biomass as biofertiliser has been regarded as a promising way to redirect P from wastewater to the field. This also makes the study of molecular mechanisms underlying P uptake and storage in microalgae of great interest. In the present paper, we review phosphate models, which express the growth rate as a function of intra- and extracellular phosphorus content for better understanding of phosphate uptake and dynamics of phosphate pools.",

Meso level integration is represented by organizational and professional elements of the Rainbow Model, which are of particular interest in our nine case studies. Each of the three cases in Ontario and three in New Zealand are different and described separately. In Quebec, a local health services network model is presented across the three cases studied with variations in the way it is implemented. The three cases selected in the three jurisdictions under study were not chosen to be representative of wider practice within each country, but rather represent interesting and unique models of community-based primary healthcare integration. Similarities and variations in the integrated care models, context and dimension of integration offer insights regarding core component of integration of services, offering a foundational understanding of the cases on which future analysis will be based.",

Laboratory tests were performed on small-scale foundation models to study the behaviour of circular, skirted foundations subjected to vertical loads.

The results of the model tests have shown that using skirts improve the bearing capacity and settlement values of skirted foundations compared with shallow foundations without skirt. The improvement in bearing capacity and a reduction in settlement of shallow foundations increase with increasing the skirt depth, roughness of skirt sides and decreasing the relative density of sand. The ultimate bearing capacity of shallow foundations may be increased by up to 5·0 times and the settlement can be reduced to a value of 8% of those of foundations without skirts. On the basi...",

The results of fifty-four models indicated that the construction of a pile group with a diameter of 1 meter and a length of 14 meters significantly diminished the ‏consolidation settlement of the soil in the Northern Fereshteh area, where the settlement value has been triggered by the load inflicted by earthquake. Moreover, the construction of four layers of geogrid at intervals of one meter led to a significant decrease in the settlement.

The novelty of this theory is that it contains only four unknowns and also accommodates the thickness stretching effect. Two kinds of micromechanics models, namely, the Voigt and Mori–Tanaka models, are considered. Material properties of the functionally graded plates are assumed to vary continuously in the thickness direction according to either a simple power law or an exponential law. Finite element formulation is done using C° continuous Lagrangian quadrilateral nine-noded elements with eight degrees of freedom per node. The equations of motion are derived using a variational approach. Convergence and comparison studies are carried out to establish the authenticity and reliability of the solutions. The effect of various boundary conditions, geometric conditions, micromechanics models, and foundation parameters on the flexural and vibration response of the functionally graded plate are investigated.",

Wheel–rail contact forces, bending moments in the concrete panel and load distributions on the supporting foundation are evaluated. Two generic slab track models including one or two layers of concrete slabs are presented. The upper layer containing the discrete slab panels is described by decoupled beams of finite length, while the lower layer is a continuous beam. Both the rail and concrete layers are modelled using Rayleigh–Timoshenko beam theory. Rail receptances for the two slab track models are compared with the receptance of a traditional ballasted track. The described procedure is demonstrated by two application examples involving: (i) the periodic response due to the rail seat passing frequency as influenced by the vehicle speed and a foundation stiffness gradient and (ii) the transient response due to a local rail irregularity (dipped welded joint).",

The complex interactions between flow and bed materials will result in a scour hole around structures. This process compromises their stability and the shift in the natural frequency of a bridge. Among various foundation types, pile groups and caissons are widely used in deep water. In this study, flume tests are conducted to investigate the scour behaviors of foundations with different widths, types and configurations, including cylindrical, cubic, cubic with 45° attack angle, and pile groups. The scour characteristics of these foundation types and configurations are analyzed according to the observation from flume tests. In conjunction with the experiments, computational fluid dynamics models are built to further analyze the scour mechanism. Then, influences of foundation wides have been carried out together with an elaborate description of scour evolution has been addressed to unveil the scour mechanism. Numerical simulations were carried out under the same conditions as the experiments but with wider ranges of foundation diameter. Recommendations are proposed based on a comprehensive analysis of experimental phenomena and computational models, which intends to provide guidance for practice in mitigating the risk of bridge scour.",

Based on a practical engineering project, this work presents a three-dimensional finite element numerical simulation method using ANSYS software. According to Chinese design code, the models of adjacent shear wall structures on Shanghai soft soil with the rigid foundation, box foundation and pile foundation are built respectively. In the simulation, the Davidenkov model of the soil skeleton curve is assumed for soil behavior, and the contact elements with Kelvin model are adopted to simulate pounding phenomena between adjacent structures. Finally, the dynamic responses of adjacent structures considering the pounding and SSSI effects are analyzed. The results show that pounding phenomena may occur, indicating that the seismic separation requirement for adjacent buildings of Chinese design code may not be enough to avoid pounding effect. Pounding and SSSI effects worsen the adjacent buildings’ conditions because their acceleration and shear responses are amplified after pounding considering SSSI. These results are significant for studying the effect of pounding and SSSI phenomena on seismic responses of structures and national sustainable development, especially in earthquake prevention and disaster reduction.",

Skin SST is formulated as the sum of a foundation temperature, a warm‐layer temperature difference, and a thermal skin temperature difference. Foundation temperature is taken from the Operational Sea surface Temperature and sea Ice Analysis (OSTIA) system, while numerical models are used for the warm layer and thermal skin layer. Both the thermal skin layer and warm‐layer models are forced using outputs from the Met Office's numerical weather prediction system. Data assimilation is used to improve estimates of the warm layer, with observations coming from the geostationary SEVIRI and GOES‐W instruments, as well as the polar orbiting NOAA‐AVHRR sensors. The SST observations of these instruments are converted to observations of the warm‐layer temperature difference by subtracting an instrument‐specific foundation SST calculated using just night‐time data from that sensor. A quality control procedure removes warm‐layer observations where the satellite‐specific foundation estimates are less robust due to lack of data.",

        "abstract": "Pounding and unseating damages to bridge superstructures have been commonly observed in many previous major earthquakes. These damages can essentially attribute to the large closing or opening relative displacement between adjacent structures. This article carries out an experimental study on the pounding responses of adjacent bridge structures considering spatially varying ground motions using a shaking table array system. Two sets of large-scale (1:6) bridge models involving two bridge frames were constructed. The bridge models were subjected to the stochastically simulated ground motions in bi-direction based on the response spectra of Chinese Guideline for Seismic Design of Highway Bridge for three different site conditions, considering three coherency levels. Two types of boundary conditions, that is, the fixed foundation and rocking foundation, were applied to investigate the influence of the foundation type. In addition, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model was constructed to simulate an experimental case. The nonlinear material behavior including strain rate effects of concrete and steel reinforcement is included. The applicability and accuracy of the finite element model in simulating bridge pounding responses subjected to spatially varying ground motions are discussed. The experimental and numerical results demonstrate that non-uniform excitations and foundation rocking can affect the relative displacements and pounding responses significantly.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Due to the rapid development of process manufacturing, composite materials with graphene-reinforcement have obtained commercially notices in promoted engineering applications. For this regard, vibrational characteristics of a cylindrical nanoshell reinforced by graphene nanoplatelets (GPL) and coupled with piezoelectric actuator (PIAC) is investigated. Also, the nanostructure is embedded in a viscoelastic medium. The material properties of piece-wise graphene-reinforced composite (GPLRC) are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction of a cylindrical nanoshell and estimated through a nanomechanical model. For the first time in the current study is considering the effects of piezoelectric layer, viscoelastic foundation, GPLRC, and size-effects on the frequency responses of the GPLRC cylindrical nanoshell coupled with PIAC and by assuming perfect bonding between the core (GPLRC cylindrical shell) and the piezoelectric layer. The governing equations and boundary conditions have been developed using minimum potential energy and solved with the aid of the generalized differential quadrature method. In addition, because of piezoelectric layer, Maxwell's equation is derived. The results show that viscoelastic foundation, piezoelectric layer, GPL distribution pattern, length scale parameter and GPL weight function have important role in the frequency characteristics of the GPLRC cylindrical nanoshell coupled with PIAC and surrounded by viscoelastic foundation. The results of the current study are useful suggestions for design of materials science, micro-electro-mechanical systems, and nanoelectromechanical systems such as nanoactuators and nanosensors.

        "abstract": "To investigate the seismic performance of a wind turbine that is influenced by both the ice load and the seismic load, the research proposes a numerical approach for simulating the seismic behavior of a wind turbine on a monopile foundation. First, the fluid–solid coupled equation for the water–ice–wind turbine is simplified by assigning reasonable boundary conditions and solving the motion equation, and the seismic motion equation of the wind turbine is developed. Then, on this basis, we propose a simplified 3D numerical model that can simulate the interactions among the wind turbine, water and sea ice. By conducting shaking table tests, the results demonstrate that the established numerical model is effective. Finally, we investigate the effect of the boundary range and ice thickness on the seismic performance of a turbine under near-field and far-field seismic actions. Research results illustrate that ice changes the distribution form of the hydrodynamic pressure. Moreover, the thickness of the ice greatly influences the seismic behavior, while the influence of the ice boundary range is only within a certain range. Additionally, the ice load decreases the energy-dissipating capacity of the wind turbine, so the earthquake resilience of the wind turbine is significantly decreased.",

        "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) is an emerging concept that is gaining attention in various industries. It refers to the ability to clone a physical object (PO) into a software counterpart. The softwarized object, termed logical object, reflects all the important properties and characteristics of the original object within a specific application context. To fully determine the expected properties of the DT, this article surveys the state-of-the-art starting from the original definition within the manufacturing industry. It takes into account related proposals emerging in other fields, namely augmented and virtual reality (e.g., avatars), multiagent systems, and virtualization. This survey thereby allows for the identification of an extensive set of DT features that point to the “softwarization” of POs. To properly consolidate a shared DT definition, a set of foundational properties is identified and proposed as a common ground outlining the essential characteristics (must-haves) of a DT. Once the DT definition has been consolidated, its technical and business value is discussed in terms of applicability and opportunities. Four application scenarios illustrate how the DT concept can be used and how some industries are applying it. The scenarios also lead to a generic DT architectural model. This analysis is then complemented by the identification of software architecture models and guidelines in order to present a general functional framework for the DT. This article, eventually, analyses a set of possible evolution paths for the DT considering its possible usage as a major enabler for the softwarization process.",

        "abstract": "Due to the limitation in the prediction of the foundation pit settlement, this paper proposed a new methodology which takes advantage of the grey Verhulst model and a genetic algorithm. In the previous study, excavation times are often the only factor to predict the settlement, which is mainly because the correspondence between real-time excavation depth and the excavation time is hard to determine. To solve this issue, the supporting times are precisely recorded and the excavation depth rate can be obtained through the excavation time length and excavation depth between two adjacent supports. After the correspondence between real-time excavation depth and the excavation time is obtained, the internal friction angle, cohesion, bulk density, Poisson’s ratio, void ratio, water level changes, permeability coefficient, number of supports, and excavation depth, which can influence the settlement, are taken to be considered in this study. For the application of the methodology, the settlement monitoring point of D4, which is near the bridge pier of the highway, is studied in this paper. The predicted values of the BP neural network, GA-BP neural network, BP neural network optimized by the grey Verhulst model, and GA-BP neural network optimized by the grey Verhulst model are detailed compared with the measured values. And the evaluation indexes of RMSE, MAE, MSE, MAPE, and \n \n \n \n R\n \n \n 2\n \n \n \n are calculated for these models. The results show that the grey Verhulst model can greatly improve the consistency between predicted values and measured values, while the accuracy and resolution is still low. The genetic algorithm (GA) can greatly improve the accuracy of the predicted values, while the GA-BP neural network shows low reflection to the fluctuation of measured values. The GA-BP neural network optimized by the grey Verhulst model, which has taken the advantages of GA and the grey Verhulst model, has extremely high accuracy and well consistency with the measured values.",

        "abstract": "During operation, a buried pipeline is threatened by a variety of geological hazards, particularly in permafrost regions, where freezing-thawing disasters have a significant influence on the integrity and safety of the buried pipelines. The topographical environmental conditions along the pipeline, as well as the influence of frost heave and thaw settlement on the pipeline’s foundation soil, must be considered in the design and construction stage. Theoretical analysis, numerical modeling, field testing, and mitigation measures on vital energy pipelines in permafrost have been widely documented, but no attempt has been made to review the freezing-thawing disasters, current research methodologies, and mitigation strategies. This article reviews the formation mechanisms and mitigation measures for frost hazards (e.g., differential frost heave, thaw settlement, slope instability, frost mounds, icing, river ice scouring, and pipeline floating) along buried pipelines in permafrost regions and summarizes and prospects the major progress in the research on mechanisms, analysis methods, model test, and field monitoring based on publications of studies of key energy pipelines in permafrost regions. This review will provide scholars with a basic understanding of the challenging freezing-thawing hazards encountered by energy pipelines in permafrost regions, as well as research on the stability and mitigation of pipeline foundation soils plagued by freezing-thawing hazards in permafrost regions under a warming climate and degrading permafrost environment.",

Both names refer to a family of computational models that use high-dimensional distributed representations and rely on the algebraic properties of their key operations to incorporate the advantages of structured symbolic representations and vector distributed representations. Holographic Reduced Representations [321, 326] is an influential HDC/VSA model that is well known in the machine learning domain and often used to refer to the whole family. However, for the sake of consistency, we use HDC/VSA to refer to the field. Part I of this survey [222] covered foundational aspects of the field, such as the historical context leading to the development of HDC/VSA, key elements of any HDC/VSA model, known HDC/VSA models, and the transformation of input data of various types into high-dimensional vectors suitable for HDC/VSA. This second part surveys existing applications, the role of HDC/VSA in cognitive computing and architectures, as well as directions for future work. Most of the applications lie within the Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence domain; however, we also cover other applications to provide a complete picture.

        "abstract": "This paper reports on the results of soil-foundation numerical modelling and the seismic response of a cooling tower founded on piles of a petrochemical facility located in the city of Augusta (Sicily, Italy). The city was affected in the past by some destructive earthquakes (1693, 1848, and 1990) that damaged a large territory of Southeastern Sicily, which was characterized by a very high seismic hazard. With this aim, the paper reports the FEM modelling of the seismic behaviour of the coupled soil-structure system. To determine the soil profile and the geotechnical characteristics, laboratory and in situ investigations were carried out in the studied area. The seismic event occurred in January 1693 and has been chosen as a scenario earthquake. Moreover, a parametric study with different input motions has also been carried out. A Mohr-Coulomb model has been adopted for the soil, and structural elements have been simulated by means of an elastic constitutive model. Two different vertical alignments have been analysed, considering both the free-field condition and the soil-structure interaction. The dynamic response has been investigated in terms of accelerations, response spectra, and amplification functions. The results have also been compared with those provided by Italian technical regulations. Finally, the seismic response of the coupled soil-structure system has been further examined in terms of peak bending moments along the pile foundation, emphasizing the possibility of a kinematic interaction on piles induced by the seismic action.",

To reproduce simulation results and reuse models, researchers must exchange unambiguous model descriptions. We review the latest edition of the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a format designed for this purpose. A community of modelers and software authors developed SBML Level 3 over the past decade. Its modular form consists of a core suited to representing reaction‐based models and packages that extend the core with features suited to other model types including constraint‐based models, reaction‐diffusion models, logical network models, and rule‐based models. The format leverages two decades of SBML and a rich software ecosystem that transformed how systems biologists build and interact with models. More recently, the rise of multiscale models of whole cells and organs, and new data sources such as single‐cell measurements and live imaging, has precipitated new ways of integrating data with models. We provide our perspectives on the challenges presented by these developments and how SBML Level 3 provides the foundation needed to support this evolution.",

Material properties of porous FG plate are defined by rule of the mixture with an additional term of porosity in the through-thickness direction. By including indeterminate integral variables, the number of unknowns and governing equations of the present theory is reduced, and therefore, it is easy to use. The present approach to plate theory takes into account both transverse shear and normal \ndeformations and satisfies the boundary conditions of zero tensile stress on the plate surfaces. The equations of motion are derived from the Hamilton principle. Analytical solutions are obtained for a simply supported plate. Contrary to any other theory, the number of unknown functions involved in the displacement field is only five, as compared to six or more in the case of other shear and normal deformation theories. A comparison with the corresponding results is made to verify the accuracy and \nefficiency of the present theory.

Yet, arising from the interaction between the organism and its ecology in the course of phylogeny and ontogeny, human memory is also profoundly collective and cultural. In this review, I discuss the cultural foundation of human memory. I start by briefly reflecting on the conception of memory against a historical and cultural background. I then detail a model of a culturally saturated mnemonic system in which cultural elements constitute and condition various processes of remembering, focusing on memory representation, perceptual encoding, memory function, memory reconstruction, memory expression, and memory socialization. Then I discuss research on working memory, episodic memory, and autobiographical memory as examples that further demonstrate how cultural elements shape the processes and consequences of remembering and lay the foundation for human memory. I conclude by outlining some important future directions in memory research. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Psychology, Volume 72 is January 4, 2021.

Torque effect of an axial magnetic field on an FG nano-rod has been defined using Maxwell’s relation. The material properties were assumed to vary according to the power law in radial direction. The Navier equation and boundary conditions of the size-dependent FG nano-rod were derived by the Hamilton’s principle. These equations were solved by employing the generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM). Presented model has the ability to turn into the classical model if the material length scale parameter is taken to be zero. The effects of some parameters, such as inhomogeneity constant, magnetic field and small-scale parameter, were studied. As an important result of this study can be stated that an FG nano-rod model based on the nonlocal elasticity theory behaves softer and has smaller natural frequency.",

        "abstract": "In order to research the theory for the variety of transverse forces of the adjacent shield tunnels caused by foundation pits excavation, the effect mechanism of foundation pit excavation on the adjacent shield tunnel was analyzed. The sidewall unloading model of the foundation pit, considering the deformation of the retaining structures, was introduced to calculate the additional stress of soil caused by foundation pit excavation. On this basis, the additional confining pressure variation model of the adjacent shield tunnel was established, considering the influence of the longitudinal deformation. Take the deep foundation pit project by the side of the shield tunnel of Hangzhou Metro Line 2 as a case study, the variation in confining pressure distribution of the adjacent shield tunnel caused by foundation pit excavation was analyzed, and a simplified finite element model was established to calculate the internal force of the segment ring structure. Moreover, the influence factors were analyzed, such as the deformation of the foundation pit retaining structure, the clearance between the foundation pit and the adjacent tunnel, and the buried depth of the tunnel. The present study suggests that the foundation pit excavation reduces the confining pressure of the adjacent shield tunnel, increases the absolute value of bending moment and shear force, and decreases the axial force at the top and bottom of the tunnel’s segment ring. With the increase in the deformation of the foundation pit’s retaining structure, the absolute value of the additional confining pressure on the adjacent tunnel increases, and the response of the bending moment to the foundation pit excavation unloading is more obvious than the variation in the confining pressure. When the buried depth of the adjacent shield tunnel is deeper than the excavation depth of the foundation pit, the influence of the excavation on the tunnel will be obviously weakened. With the decrease in the distance between the pit and tunnel, the influence of the excavation on the tunnel will be enhanced.",

Thus, it is essential to taking correct measures to guarantee the safety of existing structure. In this case, a typical case of metro shield tunnel crossing through city overpass bridge piles underpinning construction project is studied by the numerical method and site field monitoring. According to the existing overpass bridge structure, geological conditions and site operation environment, a suitable construction method of piles foundation underpinning plan for this project is adopted. In order to ensure the structure safety of the existed overpass bridge during the pile foundation underpinning construction, a numerical simulation model is established which takes the whole foundation underpinning structure and construction steps into consideration. The numerical simulation result shows that the stress and the settlement of the piles foundation underpinning structure is reasonable. After the comparing of the site monitoring data with the numerical model simulation results, it is found that the site settlement and stress results are highly consistent with the calculated results, and it proves the feasibility of the piles foundation underpinning construction scheme. Eventually, the site gauging settlement data of the overpass pier and the pile cap indicate that the original overpass structure is barely affected by the shield tunnel construction, the construction method can provide reference and experience for the future similar projects.",

A known complication of cisplatin administration is acute kidney injury (AKI). The development of effective tumour interventions with reduced nephrotoxicity relies heavily on understanding the molecular pathophysiology of cisplatin-induced AKI. Rodent models have provided mechanistic insight into the pathophysiology of cisplatin-induced AKI. In the subsequent review, we provide a detailed discussion of recent advances in the cisplatin-induced AKI phenotype, principal mechanistic findings of injury and therapy, and pre-clinical use of AKI rodent models. Cisplatin-induced AKI murine models faithfully develop gross manifestations of clinical AKI such as decreased kidney function, increased expression of tubular injury biomarkers, and tubular injury evident by histology. Pathways involved in AKI include apoptosis, necrosis, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress, ultimately providing a translational platform for testing the therapeutic efficacy of potential interventions. This review provides a discussion of the foundation laid by cisplatin-induced AKI rodent models for our current understanding of AKI molecular pathophysiology.",

        "abstract": "Currently, numerical studies at the real scale of an entire engineering structure considering internal erosion are still rare. This paper presents a three‐dimensional (3D) numerical simulation of the effects of internal erosion within a linear dike located on a foundation. A two‐dimensional (2D) finite element code has been extended to 3D in order to analyze the impact of internal erosion under more realistic hydromechanical conditions. The saturated soil has been considered as a mixture of four interacting constituents: soil skeleton, erodible fines, fluidized fine particles, and fluid. The detachment and transport of the fine particles have been modeled with a mass exchange model between the solid and the fluid phases. An elastoplastic constitutive model for sand‐silt mixtures has been developed to monitor the effect of the evolution of both the porosity and the fines content induced by internal erosion upon the behavior of the soil skeleton. An unsaturated flow condition has been implemented into this coupled hydromechanical model to describe more accurately the seepage within the dike and the foundation. A stabilized finite element method was used to eliminate spurious numerical oscillations in solving the convection‐dominated transport of fluidized particles. This numerical tool was then applied to a specific dike‐on‐foundation case subjected to internal erosion induced by a leakage located at the bottom of the foundation. Different failure modes were observed and analyzed for different boundary conditions, including the significant influence of the leakage cavity size and the elevation of the water level at the upstream and downstream sides of the dike.",

However, studies of urogenital tract development in murine systems, particularly those involving tissue recombination and targeted gene mutation, indicate that the ideal uterine organizational programme evolves epigenetically through dynamic cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions that define the microenvironmental context within which gene expression occurs and may ensure adult tissue stability. In the cow and ewe, transient postnatal exposure of the developing uterus to steroids can produce immutable changes in adult uterine tissues that may alter the embryotrophic potential of the uterine environment. Thus, success of steroid-sensitive postnatal events supporting uterine growth and development can dictate the functional potential of the adult uterus. Studies to determine effects of specific steroidal agents on patterns of uterine development during defined neonatal periods, as well as the functional consequences of targeted neonatal steroid exposure in the adult uterus, should enable identification of critical developmental mechanisms and determinants of uterine integrity and function. Extreme adult uterine phenotypes (lesion models) created in cattle and sheep by strategic postnatal steroid exposure hold promise as powerful tools for the study of factors affecting uterine function and the rapid identification of novel uterine genes.",

An ensemble of 20 strong ground motions recorded on National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program site class D was employed for analyzing soil–structure systems with the Winkler foundation model and an equivalent single-degree-of-freedom system as the superstructure. Results show that there are key parameters that control the amount of difference between the elastic and inelastic modeling of the soil at the soil–foundation interface. Depending on the structural aspect ratio, the elastic modeling leads to an overestimated result for the total lateral displacement demands. Also, more than 50% reduction in the superstructure demands is desired when nonlinear soil modeling is considered and foundation sliding is allowed. The benefits from the “shrinking-dominated rocking motion” can be acquired with inelastic soil material that limits the transferred inertial force into the superstructure.",

However, the theoretical foundation of CE remains poorly structured and insufficiently explored. Recent studies have shown that the CE model draws on different schools of thought and that its origins are mainly rooted in fields such as industrial ecology (IE) and ecological economics (EE). In this article, we investigate the links between CE, IE, and EE and provide an overview of the similarities and differences between these fields. At the same time, we analyze to what extent the linkages between IE and EE can create a coherent body of knowledge for CE, and be used to identify further research opportunities. This paper shows that, until now, research on CE seems to be mainly rooted in the field of IE and based on concepts and tools that already exist in other fields, rather than inventing new ones. The reconciliation of IE and EE could provide a mechanism to extend beyond such a narrow focus, and increase knowledge of the theoretical and practical framework of CE to benefit sustainability.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the current study, vibration analysis of functionally graded (FG) nano-sized beams resting on a elastic foundation is presented via a finite element method. The elastic foundation is simulated by using one-parameter Winkler type elastic foundation model. Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity theory are utilized to model the functionally graded nano-sized beams with various boundary conditions such as simply supported at both ends (S-S), clamped-clamped (C-C) and clamped-simply supported (C-S). Material properties of functionally graded nanobeam vary across the thickness direction according to the power-law distribution. The vibration behaviors of functionally graded nanobeam composed of alumina (Al2O3) and steel are shown using nonlocal finite element formulation. The importance of this paper is the utilize of shape functions and the Eringen's nonlocal elasticity theory to set up the stiffness matrices and mass matrices of the functionally graded nano-sized beam resting on Winkler elastic foundation for free vibration analysis. Bending stiffness, foundation stiffness and mass matrices are obtained to realize the solution of vibration problem of the FG nanobeam. The influences of power-law exponent (k), dimensionless nonlocal parameters (e0a/L), dimensionless Winkler foundation parameters (KW), mode numbers and boundary conditions on frequencies are investigated via several numerical examples and shown by a number of tables and figures.",

It is supposed that the nanotube is modelled as cantilever type beam and subjected to a harmonic load. The material property of the nanotube is modelled by Kelvin–Voigt viscoelastic constitutive relation and slip boundary conditions of nanotube conveying fluid are taken into account. Extended Galerkin method is used to obtain the nonlinear differential equation of the motion and the multiple time-scales method is utilised to investigate the primary vibration resonance of the nanotube. Firstly, the frequency analysis is performed on the linear system and the effects of foundation coefficients on the natural frequency are investigated at several flow velocities. Moreover, the resonance properties of the system are solved in closed form and analysed from the frequency-response curves, and then the effects of the non-local parameter, length scale parameter and magnetic field are fully investigated. In this case, non-local parameter, length scale parameter and foundation coefficients are highly influential on the frequency response of the considered system.",

In this study, the edge-based smoothed technique is integrated with the mixed interpolation of the tensorial component technique for the three-node triangular element (MITC3) to give so-called ES-MITC3, which helps improve significantly the accuracy for the standard MITC3 element. The EFTIM model is formed by adding a mass parameter of foundation into the Winkler–Pasternak foundation model. Two parameters of the FGP materials, the power-law index (k) and the maximum porosity distributions (Ω), take forms of cosine functions. Some numerical results of the proposed method are compared with those of published works to verify the accuracy and reliability. Furthermore, the effects of geometric parameters and materials on forced vibration of the FGP plates resting on the EFTIM are also studied in detail.",

        "abstract": "Abstract : A two-dimensional numerical model is presented for calculating dune and beach erosion produced by storm waves and water levels. The empirically based model was first developed from a large data set of net cross-shore sand transport rates and geomorphic change observed in large wave tanks, then verified using high-quality field data. The aim is to reproduce macroscale features of the beach profile, with focus on the formation and movement of longshore bars. The ultimate goal is prediction of storm-induced beach erosion and post-storm recovery. Bars are simulated satisfactorily, but berm processes are less well reproduced, due in part to a lack of data for defining accretionary wave and profile processes. A new criterion is developed for predicting erosion and accretion, and the model uses this criterion to calculate net sand transport rates in four regions of the nearshore extending from deep water to the limit of wave runup. Wave height and setup across the profile are calculated to obtain the net cross-shore sand transport rate. The model is driven by engineering data, with main inputs of time series of wave height and period in deep water, time series of water level, median beach grain size, and initial profile shape. Comprehensive sensitivity testing is performed, and example applications are made to evaluate the response of the profile to the presence of a vertical seawall and behavior of different beach fill cross sections in adjustment to normal and storm wave action.

This article is the elaboration of four blog posts that together present a clear message: current DSGE models are flawed, but they contain the right foundations and must be improved rather than discarded. Further, we need different types of macroeconomic models for different purposes. Specifically, there should be five kinds of general equilibrium models: a common core, plus foundational theory, policy, toy, and forecasting models. The different classes of models have a lot to learn from each other, but the goal of full integration has proven counterproductive. No model can be all things to all people.",

        "abstract": "We examine the role of mediators in locally embedding the community foundation model of philanthropy to enable its global diffusion. We hold that mediators, as trusted agents within elite networks, promote and legitimate institutional innovation by tailoring the model to satisfy local requirements. They thereby limit resistance while creating future potentialities. Our novel addition to the community foundation literature stems from research on the transatlantic diffusion of the community foundation template from the United States to the United Kingdom focused on an in-depth case study of one of Europe’s largest community foundation, that serving Tyne & Wear and Northumberland in North East England. Our findings suggest that success in embedding the community foundation model depends on rendering it fit-for-context and fit-for-purpose. Mediators operating at both the macro and micro level matter because they have the cultural, social, and symbolic capital needed to win acceptance for initially alien philanthropic principles, practices, and structures.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Industry 4.0 aims to support the factory of the future, involving increased use of information systems and new ways of using automation, such as collaboration where a robot and a human share work on a single task. We propose a classification of collaboration levels for Human-Robot collaboration (HRC) in manufacturing that we call levels of collaboration (LoC), formed to provide a conceptual model conducive to the design of assembly lines incorporating HRC. This paper aims to provide a more theoretical foundation for such a tool based on relevant theories from cognitive science and other perspectives of human-technology interaction, strengthening the validity and scientific rigour of the envisioned LoC tool. The main contributions consist of a theoretical grounding to motivate the transition from automation to collaboration, which are intended to facilitate expanding the LoC classification to support HRC, as well as an initial visualization of the LoC approach. Future work includes fully defining the LoC classification as well as operationalizing functionally different cooperation types. We conclude that collaboration is a means to an end, so collaboration is not entered for its own sake, and that collaboration differs fundamentally from more commonly used views where automation is the focus.",

The present model incorporates two scale coefficients to examine wave dispersion relations more accurately. Material properties of FG anisotropic nanoplates are exponentially varying in the z-direction. In order to solve the governing equations for bulk waves, an analytical method is performed and wave frequencies and phase velocities are obtained as a function of wave number. The influences of several important parameters such as material graduation exponent, geometry, Winkler-Pasternak foundation parameters and wave number on the wave propagation of FG anisotropic nanoplates resting on the elastic foundation are investigated and discussed in detail. It is concluded that these parameters play significant roles on the wave propagation behavior of the nanoplates. From the best knowledge of authors, it is the first time that FG nanoplate made of anisotropic materials is investigated, so, presented numerical results can serve as benchmarks for future analysis of such structures.",

A new publicly available database, “FoRDy” (Foundation Rocking—Dynamic), summarizes the results of dynamic physical model tests of single-degree-of-freedom-like structures supported on rocking foundations. It contains data from five centrifuge and three 1-g shaking table test series that were conducted at experimental facilities in the United States, Greece, and Japan. The database includes 200 model “case histories” that span a wide range of model sizes, soil and structure properties, and seismic excitations. It is compiled as the first step toward building a comprehensive dynamic rocking foundation database, and it has the potential to grow in the future. To illustrate its usefulness, the data are used to show example correlations between the peak drift ratio demand and selected ground motion intensity measures. The results suggest that peak ground velocity (PGV), peak ground displacement (PGD), and the geometric mean of the linear spectral displacement over the period range of 0.2–3 times the initial natural period predict the peak drift ratio response reliably.",

        "abstract": "Numerous studies have repeatedly demonstrated the efficiency of using skirts to increase the bearing capacity and to reduce settlement of shallow foundations subjected to static loads. However, no efforts have been made to study the efficiency of using these skirts to reduce settlement produced by machine vibration, although machines are very sensitive to settlement and the foundations of these machines should be designed properly to ensure that the settlement produced due to machine vibration is very small. This research has been conducted to investigate the efficiency of using skirts as a technique to reduce the settlement of a strip foundation subjected to machine vibration. A two-dimensional finite element model has been developed, validated, and employed to achieve the aim of the study. The results of the analyses showed that the use of skirts reduces the settlement produced due to machine vibration. However, the percentage decrease of the settlement is remarkably influenced by the density of the soil and the frequency of vibration, where it rises as the frequency of vibration increases and declines as the soil density rises. It was also found that increasing skirt length increases the percentage decrease of the settlement. Importantly, the results obtained from the analyses have been utilized to derive new dynamic impedance values that implicitly consider the presence of skirts. Finally, novel design equations of dynamic impedance that implicitly account to the effect of the skirts have been derived and validated utilizing a new intelligent data driven method. These new equations can be used in future designs of skirted strip foundations subjected to machine vibration.",

This article outlines how strategic management was introduced in Finland in the 2000s and how this led to a significant de-democratisation of the university organisations, despite academic communities’ resistance and explicit preference for democratic self-governance. The article illustrates how strategic management informed the reconceptualization of Finnish higher education in legislation (nationally), to de-democratise and to structurally reform the HE field, and in practice (locally), to drive through desired administrative reconfigurations. This anti-democratic transformation is embodied in a new institutional model: foundation universities, which have been presented as the flagships of Finnish higher education policy, are also vehicles of de-democratisation.",

Now, 150 years after its introduction, this concept continues to enjoy widespread use in its original application field of civil engineering, and has also had a profound effect on the field of adhesion mechanics, including for soft matter adhesion phenomena. A review of the model is presented with a focus on applications to adhesion science, highlighting classical works that utilize the model as well as recent usages that extend its scope. The special case of the behavior of plates on incompressible (e.g., elastomeric and viscous liquid) foundations is reviewed because of the significant relevance to the behavior of soft matter interlayers between one or more flexible adherends.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops grounded theory to understand how and when experts in lower-power peripheral roles can develop influential relationships with higher-power line managers in core functions to regularly elicit their cooperation. I use data from an ethnographic study of experts in peripheral roles—mental health professionals hired by the U.S. Army to provide rehabilitative services to active-duty soldiers suffering from conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)—and the line managers in core functions they depended on for their soldier-care recommendations to be followed—their soldiers’ direct commanders. I analyze relational histories of 56 commander–provider dyads and detail a three-phase process model I refer to as “rapid relationality.” Through the process of rapid relationality, mental health professionals capitalized on short windows of opportunity to quickly develop influential relationships with commanders, despite lacking formal authority over them, before a series of minor conflicts or a major conflict threatened their burgeoning influence. My analysis suggests it is not only what peripheral experts do that allows them to elicit cooperation from line managers but also when and how quickly they do it that matters. Speed and taking early action are important because experts cannot predict when conflict will occur and hence may have short initial windows of opportunity for establishing an influential relationship. I further find that some experts have fewer tactics available to them or must use more time-consuming and energy-intensive tactics than others to achieve the same relational influence based on their personal characteristics (e.g., gender). As a result, it may be harder for some experts to achieve relational influence before their window of opportunity closes.",

        "abstract": "By selecting the ratio of the cumulative maximum deformation of the retaining structure to the excavation depth as the control parameter of the retaining structure deformation, this paper established a sidewall unloading model which can consider the deformation of the retaining structure and the spatial effect of foundation pit excavation. Meanwhile, the impact region of the sidewall was divided to calculate the distribution of additional stress caused by foundation pit excavation. On this basis, through introducing the collaborative deformation model for rotation and dislocation of a shield tunnel, this paper studied the longitudinal deformation of the adjacent shield tunnel due to foundation pit excavation. Moreover, several engineering cases were given to verify the reliability of the proposed method, and the influencing factors were analyzed. The following conclusions were obtained: the axial horizontal displacement of the shield tunnel by the side of the foundation pit was normally distributed, and the calculated value was in good agreement with the measured value; the longitudinal deformation of the shield tunnel was mainly induced by the unloading effect of the sidewall of the foundation pit, which was parallel and closed to the tunnel; the soil excavation in the vicinity of the buried depth of the tunnel would result in a significant increase in longitudinal deformation; with the increase in the retaining structure deformation of the foundation pit, the longitudinal deformation of the adjacent shield tunnel and its influence scope also increased; the longitudinal deformation of the shield tunnel decreased with the increase of clearances between the foundation pit and tunnel; and finally, the excavation of the foundation pit had a great influence on the shallowly buried shield tunnel nearby, and the effect of foundation pit excavation on the tunnel decreased with the increase of the burial depth of the shield tunnel.",

Common practice has been to use handcrafted dialog acts, or the output vocabulary, e.g. in neural encoder decoders, as the action spaces. Both have their own limitations. This paper proposes a novel latent action framework that treats the action spaces of an end-to-end dialog agent as latent variables and develops unsupervised methods in order to induce its own action space from the data. Comprehensive experiments are conducted examining both continuous and discrete action types and two different optimization methods based on stochastic variational inference. Results show that the proposed latent actions achieve superior empirical performance improvement over previous word-level policy gradient methods on both DealOrNoDeal and MultiWoz dialogs. Our detailed analysis also provides insights about various latent variable approaches for policy learning and can serve as a foundation for developing better latent actions in future research.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Mathematical modelling performs a vital part in estimating and controlling the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this epidemic, most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The policymakers are forced to make difficult decisions to leverage between health and economic development. How and when to make clinical and public health decisions in an epidemic situation is a challenging question. The most appropriate solution is based on scientific evidence, which is mainly dependent on data and models. So one of the most critical problems during this crisis is whether we can develop reliable epidemiological models to forecast the evolution of the virus and estimate the effectiveness of various intervention measures and their impacts on the economy. There are numerous types of mathematical model for epidemiological diseases. In this paper, we present some critical reviews on mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Some elementary models are presented as an initial formulation for an epidemic. We give some basic concepts, notations, and foundation for epidemiological modelling. More related works are also introduced and evaluated by considering epidemiological features such as disease tendency, latent effects, susceptibility, basic reproduction numbers, asymptomatic infections, herd immunity, and impact of the interventions.",

        "abstract": "Large deep foundation pits are usually in a complex environment, so their surface deformation tends to show a stable rising trend with a small range of fluctuation, which brings certain difficulty to the prediction work. Therefore, in this study we proposed a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) prediction method based on empirical wavelet transform (EWT) pretreatment is proposed for this feature. Firstly, EWT is used to conduct adaptive decomposition of the measured deformation data and extract the modal signal components with characteristic differences. Secondly, the main components affecting the deformation of the foundation pit are analyzed as a part of the external input. Then, we established a NARX prediction model for different components. Finally, all predicted values are superpositioned to obtain a total value, and the result is compared with the predicted results of the nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) model, empirical mode decomposition-nonlinear autoregressive (EMD-NAR) model, EWT-NAR model, NARX model, EMD-NARX model and EWT-NARX model. The results showed that, compared with the EWT-NAR and EWT-NARX models, the EWT-NARX model reduced the mean square error of KD25 by 91.35%, indicating that the feature of introducing external input makes NARX more suitable for combining with the EWT method. Meanwhile, compared with the EMD-NAR and EWT-NAR models, the introduction of the NARX model reduced the mean square error of KD25 by 78.58% and 95.71%, indicating that EWT had better modal decomposition capability than EMD.",

        "abstract": "The objective is to improve the prediction accuracy of foundation pit deformation in geotechnical engineering, thereby provide early warning for engineering practice. The digital close-range photogrammetry is used to obtain monitoring data. The error compensation method is used to optimize the center of the monitoring point. Aiming at the limitations of back propagation neural network (BPNN), a genetic algorithm (GA)-optimized BPNN algorithm is proposed. Then, the optimized algorithm is applied to predict the deformation and displacement of foundation pits from three aspects, i.e., simple horizontal displacement, simple longitudinal displacement, and the combination of horizontal and longitudinal displacements. Meanwhile, the time domain, space domain, and time-space domain are used as input features to compare the prediction results of the BPNN model and the GA-optimized BPNN model. Finally, the GA-improved BPNN is compared with the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model and Random Forest (RF) model. The results show that the prediction result, obtained by simultaneously using horizontal displacement and longitudinal displacement as input features, has smaller errors; also, the actual output is closer to the expected output. Compared with the prediction result with time domain and space domain as input features, the prediction result with time-space domain as input features is closer to the expected output. Taking the combination of time and space domains as input features, compared with the BPNN model, the GA-optimized BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0163), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9800), and a shorter training time (7.08 s). Compared with the SVR model and RF model, the GA-improved BPNN model has a lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value (0.0211), a larger Index of Agreement (IA) value (0.9706), and shorter training time (7.61 s). Therefore, the foundation pit deformation prediction model based on BPNN and GA has strong prediction ability, which can be popularized and applied in similar geotechnical engineering.",

        "abstract": "Significance Autonomous systems are replacing humans in a variety of tasks, and in the years to come, such systems will become central and crucial to human life. They will include vehicles of all kinds, medical and industrial robots, agricultural and manufacturing facilities, traffic management systems, and much more. While many organizations strive to develop the next generation of trustworthy, cost-effective autonomous systems, a major gap exists between the challenges in developing these and the state of the art. There is a crucial need for a common scientific and engineering foundation for developing these systems, which we term “autonomics.” We believe that such a foundation will dramatically accelerate the deployment and acceptance of high-quality autonomous systems, for the benefit of human society. The potential benefits of autonomous systems are obvious. However, there are still major issues to be dealt with before developing such systems becomes a commonplace engineering practice, with accepted and trustworthy deliverables. We argue that a solid, evolving, publicly available, community-controlled foundation for developing next-generation autonomous systems is a must, and term the desired foundation “autonomics.” We focus on three main challenges: 1) how to specify autonomous system behavior in the face of unpredictability; 2) how to carry out faithful analysis of system behavior with respect to rich environments that include humans, physical artifacts, and other systems; and 3) how to build such systems by combining executable modeling techniques from software engineering with artificial intelligence and machine learning.",

This article traces the development of these two approaches to cognitive science, from their largely autonomous early development in the first thirty years, through their collision in the 1980s around the past-tense debate (Rumelhart & McClelland 1986, Pinker & Prince 1988) and their integration in much subsequent work up to the present. Although this integration has produced a considerable body of results, the continued general gulf between these two lines of research is likely impeding progress in both: on learning in generative linguistics, and on the representation of language in neural modeling. The article concludes with a brief argument that generative linguistics is unlikely to fulfill its promise of accounting for language learning if it continues to maintain its distance from neural and statistical approaches to learning.",

Firstly, governing equations for excess pore pressures (i.e., excess pore‐air and pore‐water pressures) under the equal‐strain hypothesis are derived with the introduction of radial boundary conditions. Afterwards, the obtained coupled equations are solved by applying general integration, decoupling process, and Fourier sine series expansion. The smear coefficients and factors of drain resistance corresponding to air and water phases are both captured explicitly in the final solutions. Furthermore, the degenerated solutions are employed to verify the reliability of the current solutions. Finally, a parametric study is conducted to study the consolidation characteristics of the proposed foundation model against modeling sizes (S and N), smear coefficients (αa and αw), and drain resistance factors (Ga and Gw).",

This study reports the first fully automated tool to assess viable and necrotic tumor in osteosarcoma, employing advances in histopathology digitization and automated learning. We selected 40 digitized whole slide images representing the heterogeneity of osteosarcoma and chemotherapy response. With the goal of labeling the diverse regions of the digitized tissue into viable tumor, necrotic tumor, and non-tumor, we trained 13 machine-learning models and selected the top performing one (a Support Vector Machine) based on reported accuracy. We also developed a deep-learning architecture and trained it on the same data set. We computed the receiver-operator characteristic for discrimination of non-tumor from tumor followed by conditional discrimination of necrotic from viable tumor and found our models performing exceptionally well. We then used the trained models to identify regions of interest on image-tiles generated from test whole slide images. The classification output is visualized as a tumor-prediction map, displaying the extent of viable and necrotic tumor in the slide image. Thus, we lay the foundation for a complete tumor assessment pipeline from original histology images to tumor-prediction map generation. The proposed pipeline can also be adopted for other types of tumor.",

After a brief history of conceptual modeling, the paper addresses the aforementioned questions by proposing a characterization of conceptual models with respect to conceptual semantics and ontological commitments.

To describe the damping of the viscoelastic material according to experimental results, the Kelvin–Voigt model is replaced by a new form with a fractional-order derivative. The generalized thermoelasticity model and Euler–Bernoulli beam theory are used to construct the governing equation. The microbeam is subjected to axial load, ultrafast laser heating, and varying sinusoidal heat. The governing equation is then solved using the Laplace transform technique to determine the deflection and thermoelastic interaction responses of microbeams. The effects of many parameters such as the coefficient of viscosity, axial load, fractional derivative order, laser pulse duration, and foundation parameter on the microbeam response are explained and discussed in detail.",

Two types of porosity including evenly distributed porosities (Porosity-I) and unevenly distributed porosities (Porosity-II) are assumed as effective properties of FGM plates such as Young’s modulus, the coefficient of thermal expansion, and density. The strain-displacement formulations using Von Karman geometrical nonlinearity and general Hooke’s law are used to obtain constitutive relations. Airy stress functions with full motion equations which is employed to shorten the number of governing equations along with the boundary and initial conditions lead to a system of differential equations of the nonlinear dynamic response of porous FGM plates. Considering linear parts of these equations, natural frequencies of porous FGM plates are determined. By employing Runge-Kutta method, the numerical results illustrate the influence of geometrical configurations, volume faction index, porosity, elastic foundations, and mechanical as well as thermal loads on the nonlinear dynamic response of the plates. Good agreements are obtained in comparison with other results in the literature.",

We provide extensive empirical validation of the effectiveness of the proposed method on standard multivariate and image datasets, and benchmark its performance against state-of-the-art alternatives.

The governing equations are deduced from Hamilton’s principle based on sinusoidal shear and normal deformation theory. In order to solve seven governing equations, an iterative technique is accomplished. After all, deflection and stresses are verified with corresponding literatures.

        "abstract": "In this article, dynamic modeling of double walled cylindrical functionally graded (FG) microshell is studied. Size effect of double walled cylindrical FG microshell are investigated using modified couple stress theory (MCST). Each layer of microshell is embedded in a viscoelastic medium. For the first time, in the present study, has been considered, FG length scale parameter in double walled cylindrical FG microshells, which this parameter changes along the thickness direction. Taking into consideration the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT), double walled cylindrical FG microshell is modeled and its equations of motions are derived using Hamilton's principle. The novelty of this study is considering the effects of double layers and MCST, in addition to considering the various boundary conditions of double walled cylindrical FG microshell. Generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM) is used to discretize the model and to approximate the equation of motions and boundary conditions. Also, for confirmation, the result of current model is validated with the results obtained from molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Considering length scale parameter (l=R/3) on MCST show, the results have better agreement with MD simulation. The results show that, length, thickness, FG power index, Winkler and Pasternak coefficients and shear correction factor have important role on the natural frequency of double walled cylindrical FG microshell.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Sarcopenia – the accelerated age-related loss of muscle mass and function – is an under-diagnosed condition, and is central to deteriorating mobility, disability and frailty in older age. There is a lack of treatment options for older adults at risk of sarcopenia. Although sarcopenia's pathogenesis is multifactorial, its major phenotypes – muscle mass and muscle strength – are highly heritable. Several genome-wide association studies of muscle-related traits were published recently, providing dozens of candidate genes, many with unknown function. Therefore, animal models are required not only to identify causal mechanisms, but also to clarify the underlying biology and translate this knowledge into new interventions. Over the past several decades, small teleost fishes had emerged as powerful systems for modeling the genetics of human diseases. Owing to their amenability to rapid genetic intervention and the large number of conserved genetic and physiological features, small teleosts – such as zebrafish, medaka and killifish – have become indispensable for skeletal muscle genomic studies. The goal of this Review is to summarize evidence supporting the utility of small fish models for accelerating our understanding of human skeletal muscle in health and disease. We do this by providing a basic foundation of the (zebra)fish skeletal muscle morphology and physiology, and evidence of muscle-related gene homology. We also outline challenges in interpreting zebrafish mutant phenotypes and in translating them to human disease. Finally, we conclude with recommendations on future directions to leverage the large body of tools developed in small fish for the needs of genomic exploration in sarcopenia. Summary: Zebrafish and other small fish have become powerful disease models. Here, we summarize the evidence for the utility of small teleost models for genetic research in sarcopenia – the age-related loss of muscle mass and function.",

This study puts forward a method for the waterlogging risk assessment of deep foundation pit projects via the combination of a projection pursuit model, particle swarm optimization, and an interpolation algorithm. First, through a comprehensive analysis of the water circulation process in waterlogging and the characteristics of deep foundation pit projects, a risk index system with 11 indicators is identified and constructed. Then, a projection pursuit model optimized by particle swarm optimization is leveraged to determine the weights of the indicators and the best projection values of evaluation objects, and the mathematical function between the best projection values and the risk levels is constructed by an interpolation algorithm. Finally, three deep foundation pit projects of the Chengdu Metro Line 11 in China are selected as case studies. The results demonstrate that the frequency of storms, intensity of rainfall, preparation of emergency rescue plans, and proportion of older workers have the greatest impacts on waterlogging risk in deep foundation pits. The risk ranking of the case studies is found to be consistent with the actual situations, which proves the objectivity and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "abstract": "Graphs have been utilized as a powerful tool to model pairwise relationships between people or objects. Such structure is a special type of a broader concept referred to as hypergraph, in which each hyperedge may consist of an arbitrary number of nodes, rather than just two. A large number of real-world datasets are of this form - for example, lists of recipients of emails sent from an organization, users participating in a discussion thread or subject labels tagged in an online question. However, due to complex representations and lack of adequate tools, little attention has been paid to exploring the underlying patterns in these interactions. In this work, we empirically study a number of real-world hypergraph datasets across various domains. In order to enable thorough investigations, we introduce the multi-level decomposition method, which represents each hypergraph by a set of pairwise graphs. Each pairwise graph, which we refer to as a k-level decomposed graph, captures the interactions between pairs of subsets of k nodes. We empirically find that at each decomposition level, the investigated hypergraphs obey five structural properties. These properties serve as criteria for evaluating how realistic a hypergraph is, and establish a foundation for the hypergraph generation problem. We also propose a hypergraph generator that is remarkably simple but capable of fulfilling these evaluation metrics, which are hardly achieved by other baseline generator models.",

Nevertheless, research in this area has been lagging because of the complexity of the problem and lack of field data. Numerical modeling can be used to provide valuable data with a high level of success. A three-dimensional finite-element model of a piled raft foundation was developed to simulate the case of a piled raft foundation. The model accounts for pile-to-pile, raft-to-pile, pile-to-soil, and raft-to-soil interactions. The model was used to examine the effect of the key parameters governing the performance of this foundation during loading and, accordingly, the load shared by the piles and the raft. After validating the numerical model with available data in the literature, the model was used to develop data for a wide range of parameters and to examine the role of the foundation geometry, including pile spacing in the group, pile length, pile shape, pile diameter, and raft thickness.

This condition, referred to as developmental dyslexia, has been hypothesized to occur because of deficits in vision, attention, auditory and temporal processes, and phonology and language. Here, we used a developmentally plausible computational model of reading acquisition to investigate how the core deficits of dyslexia determined individual learning outcomes for 622 children (388 with dyslexia). We found that individual learning trajectories could be simulated on the basis of three component skills related to orthography, phonology, and vocabulary. In contrast, single-deficit models captured the means but not the distribution of reading scores, and a model with noise added to all representations could not even capture the means. These results show that heterogeneity and individual differences in dyslexia profiles can be simulated only with a personalized computational model that allows for multiple deficits.",

The theoretical model considers several Higher-order Shear Deformation Theories (HSDTs) based on the so-called Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF). The theory behind CNTs is explained in detail.

Among the many factors that affect the stability of a deep foundation pit, loading and rainfall are the two most important. Therefore, in this study, physical model experiments are carried out in the laboratory based on a pit-in-pit foundation that is typical of engineering applications in China, simulating the deformation of the system under different loading and rainfall flow conditions. Optical fibers along with constant resistance and large deformation (CRLD) bolts are adopted to collectively monitor the stress and strain inside the pit-in-pit foundation, assisted by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) displacement meters. The results of the monitoring show that the position of the inner pit relative to the outer pit has a strong influence on the stability of the outer pit. The side on which the inner pit is closest to the outer pit wall is the most prone to instability and should thus be reinforced. Comparison and analysis of monitoring results obtained with optical fibers and CRLD bolts allow a potentially dangerous slip surface to be identified, indicating the value of using this type of collective monitoring in deep foundation pits.",

        "abstract": "One of the major causes of instability in geotechnical structures such as dikes or earth dams is internal erosion, an insidious process that occurs over a long period of time. Research on this topic is still fairly new and much more needs to be understood in order to solve the problems posed by this phenomenon. This paper proposes a hydromechanical model based on porous continuous medium theory to assess how internal erosion impacts the safety of earthen structures. The saturated soil is considered as a mixture of four interacting constituents: soil skeleton, erodible fines, fluidized fine particles, and fluid. The detachment and transport of the fine particles are described by a mass exchange model between the solid and the fluid phases. An elastoplastic constitutive model for sand‐silt mixtures has been developed to monitor the effect of the evolution of both porosity and fines content induced by internal erosion upon the behavior of the soil skeleton. The model has been numerically solved with the finite element method. It has then been applied to the specific case study of a dike foundation subjected to internal erosion induced by the presence of a karstic cavity beneath the alluvium layer. The numerical results show the onset of erosion, the time‐space evolution of the eroded zone, and the hydromechanical response of the soil constituting the dike, all of which highlights the effects of the cavity location, the erosion rate, and the fines content.",

        "abstract": "An assessment of the dynamic behavior of a plane earth structure with account of its foundation is considered in the paper. A structure with a foundation is considered as an inhomogeneous system, the material of its certain parts is considered elastic or viscoelastic. To assess the effect of the foundation on dynamic behavior of the structure, a finite domain is cut from the foundation and conditions are set at the boundary of this domain that provide energy entrainment from the structure to infinity in the form of the Rayleigh wave. To describe the internal dissipation in material, a linearly hereditary theory of viscoelasticity with the Rzhanitsin kernel is used. A mathematical model, method and algorithm have been developed to assess the dynamic behavior of the structure-finite foundation system. To ensure the adequacy of the mathematical model and to assess the accuracy of the calculation, model problems have been solved when describing the process under consideration. Dynamic behavior of inhomogeneous viscoelastic system of earth dam-foundation with non-reflecting boundary conditions on the boundary of the final domain of the foundation is investigated. In the process of studying the dynamic behavior of inhomogeneous viscoelastic “structure-foundation” systems, a number of mechanical effects.",

        "abstract": "To effectively prevent land subsidence over abandoned coal mines, it is necessary to quantitatively identify vulnerable areas. In this study, we evaluated the performance of predictive Bayesian, functional, and meta-ensemble machine learning models in generating land subsidence susceptibility (LSS) maps. All models were trained using half of a land subsidence inventory, and validated using the other half of the dataset. The model performance was evaluated by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the resulting LSS map for each model. Among all models tested, the logit boost, which is a meta-ensemble machine leaning model, generated LSS maps with the highest accuracy (91.44%), i.e., higher than that of the other Bayesian and functional machine learning models, including the Bayes net (86.42%), naïve Bayes (85.39%), logistic (88.92%), and multilayer perceptron models (86.76%). The LSS maps produced in this study can be used to mitigate subsidence risk for people and important facilities within the study area, and as a foundation for further studies in other regions.",

We build theory by relying on past research and using a Q-method to capture the subjective perspectives of people who experience communication overload. In our refinement of this abstract concept, we identified seven dimensions composing communication overload. The dimensions included: compromising message quality, having many distractions, using many information and communication technologies, pressuring for decisions, feeling responsible to respond, overwhelming with information, and piling up of messages. Our reconceptualization integrates disparate research, links the availability–expectation–pressure pattern to overload, and elaborates on communication quality, quantity, and generalized perceptions of feeling overwhelmed. The resulting formative theoretical model sets the stage for additional theorizing and empirical studies.",

The fractional-order derivative-based Kelvin–Voigt model describes the rheological properties of the viscoelastic foundation. The Riemann–Liouville fractional derivative model is applied for a fractional derivative order. The modal superposition method and Triangular strip matrix approach are applied to solve the fractional differential equation of motion. The dependence of the modal convergence on the system parameters is studied. The influences of (a) the fractional order of derivative, (b) the speed of the moving point load and (c) the foundation parameters on the dynamic response of the system are studied and conclusions are drawn. The damping of the beam-foundation system increases with increasing the order of derivative, leading to a decrease in the dynamic amplification factor. The results are compared with those using the classical integer-order derivative-based foundation model. The classical foundation model over-predicts the damping and under-predicts the dynamic deflections and stresses. The results of the classical (integer-order) foundation model are verified with literature.",

        "abstract": "Many journalism stakeholders have begun looking to philanthropic foundations to help newsrooms find economic sustainability. The rapidly expanding role of foundations as a revenue source for news publishers raises an important question: How do foundations exercise their influence over the newsrooms they fund? Using the hierarchy of influence model, this study utilizes more than 40 interviews with journalists at digitally native nonprofit news organizations and employees from foundations that fund nonprofit journalism to better understand the impact of foundation funding on journalistic practice. Drawing on previous scholarship exploring extra-media influence on the news industry, we argue that the impact of foundations on journalism parallels that of advertisers throughout the 20th century—with one important distinction: Journalism practitioners and researchers have long forbidden the influence from advertisers on editorial decisions, seeing the blurring of the two as inherently unethical. Outside funding from foundations, on the other hand, is often premised on editorial influence, complicating efforts by journalists to maintain the firewall between news revenue and production.",

        "abstract": "The displacement at arbitrary point in the dam is composed of two parts: One is the elastic deformation of dam body and the other that is due to the constrained deformation of foundation. The two parts should be separated to obtain reliable information reflecting the different characteristics of dam body and foundation. A simplified simulation method for gravity dam foundations is proposed that reflects the constrained deformation of foundation in a rational manner while taking into account the complex and diverse mechanical properties. Only the effects of the foundation on dam is investigated in the proposed model, and they are considered either centralized constraints or distributed constraints. The solution of the global foundation deformation is based on the monitoring displacements at measuring points in the gravity dam section using the hybrid partition finite element–interface boundary element approach. The reaction of the foundation on dam can be reflected by the global foundation deformation and the constrained force at dam bottom. On the basis, the whole dam response under a given load combination can be estimated using finite element theory. Three analyses have been performed on a typical gravity dam section to verify the feasibility of simplified simulations for different foundations as well as to allow for discussions regarding the differences among the simulations. An example analysis based on the proposed method is performed on a prototype gravity dam, and the results, which compared with actual measurements for discussions, show that the proposed method is reasonable and practical.",

        "abstract": "We investigated direct and indirect effects of component skills on writing (DIEW) using data from 193 children in Grade 1. In this model, working memory was hypothesized to be a foundational cognitive ability for language and cognitive skills as well as transcription skills, which, in turn, contribute to writing. Foundational oral language skills (vocabulary and grammatical knowledge) and higher-order cognitive skills (inference and theory of mind) were hypothesized to be component skills of text generation (i.e., discourse-level oral language). Results from structural equation modeling largely supported a complete mediation model among 4 variations of the DIEW model. Discourse-level oral language, spelling, and handwriting fluency completely mediated the relations of higher-order cognitive skills, foundational oral language, and working memory to writing. Moreover, language and cognitive skills had both direct and indirect relations to discourse-level oral language. Total effects, including direct and indirect effects, were substantial for discourse-level oral language (.46), working memory (.43), and spelling (.37); followed by vocabulary (.19), handwriting (.17), theory of mind (.12), inference (.10), and grammatical knowledge (.10). The model explained approximately 67% of variance in writing quality. These results indicate that multiple language and cognitive skills make direct and indirect contributions, and it is important to consider both direct and indirect pathways of influences when considering skills that are important to writing.",

        "abstract": "One Health (OH), EcoHealth (EH), and Planetary Health (PH) share an interest in transdisciplinary efforts that bring together scientists, citizens, government and private sectors to implement contextualized actions that promote adaptive health management across human, animal and ecosystem interfaces. A key operational element underlying these Integrated Approaches to Health (IAH) is use of Systems Thinking as a set of tools for integration. In this paper we discuss the origins and epistemology of systems thinking and argue that participatory modeling, informed by both systems theory and expertise in facilitating engagement and social learning, can help ground IAH theoretically and support its development. Participatory modeling is iterative and adaptive, which is necessary to deal with complexity in practice. Participatory modeling (PM) methods actively involve affected interests and stakeholders to ground the field of inquiry in a specific social-ecological context. Furthermore, PM processes act to reconcile the diverse understandings of the empirical world that stem from divergent discipline and community viewpoints. In this perspective article, we argue that PM can support systems thinking in practice and is essential for IAH implementation. Accordingly we invite PH, OH, and EH practitioners to systematically incorporate specialists in systems science and social engagement and facilitation. This will enable the appropriate contextualization of research practice and interventions, and ensure a balanced representation of the roles and relationships of medical, biological, mathematical, and social disciplines. For completeness, funding schemes supporting IAH need to follow the same iterative, adaptive, and participative processes to accompany IAH projects throughout their implementation.",

        "abstract": "Abstract. Terrestrial ecosystems have absorbed roughly 30 % of anthropogenic CO2 emissions over the past decades, but it is unclear whether this carbon (C) sink will endure into the future. Despite extensive modeling and experimental and observational studies, what fundamentally determines transient dynamics of terrestrial C storage under global change is still not very clear. Here we develop a new framework for understanding transient dynamics of terrestrial C storage through mathematical analysis and numerical experiments. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate force driving ecosystem C storage change is the C storage capacity, which is jointly determined by ecosystem C input (e.g., net primary production, NPP) and residence time. Since both C input and residence time vary with time, the C storage capacity is time-dependent and acts as a moving attractor that actual C storage chases. The rate of change in C storage is proportional to the C storage potential, which is the difference between the current storage and the storage capacity. The C storage capacity represents instantaneous responses of the land C cycle to external forcing, whereas the C storage potential represents the internal capability of the land C cycle to influence the C change trajectory in the next time step. The influence happens through redistribution of net C pool changes in a network of pools with different residence times. Moreover, this and our other studies have demonstrated that one matrix equation can replicate simulations of most land C cycle models (i.e., physical emulators). As a result, simulation outputs of those models can be placed into a three-dimensional (3-D) parameter space to measure their differences. The latter can be decomposed into traceable components to track the origins of model uncertainty. In addition, the physical emulators make data assimilation computationally feasible so that both C flux- and pool-related datasets can be used to better constrain model predictions of land C sequestration. Overall, this new mathematical framework offers new approaches to understanding, evaluating, diagnosing, and improving land C cycle models.",

In this study, the cyclic behavior of WSCBF for OWTs embedded in saturated clay was investigated using a large-scale model subjected to lateral cyclic loading. The responses of foundation under constant- and various-amplitude cyclic loadings were recorded in terms of displacements, rotations, and bending moments. The variations in stiffness and damping were obtained, and a collaborative bearing mechanical model between the bucket and soil was considered, which was beneficial for improving the stiffness of the whole structure. Accumulative deformation was found to have little effect on the bearing capacity of the foundation. Dynamic analysis in frequency domain was further performed on both moment and rotation data, and the complex, frequency-dependent impedance was also studied.",

        "abstract": "Due to its excellent biological and mechanical properties, silk fibroin has been intensively explored for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. However, lack of translational evidence has hampered its clinical application for tissue repair. Here a silk fibroin film is developed and its translational potential is investigated for skin repair by performing comprehensive preclinical and clinical studies to fully evaluate its safety and effectiveness. The silk fibroin film fabricated using all green chemistry approaches demonstrates remarkable characteristics, including transmittance, fluid handling capacity, moisture vapor permeability, waterproofness, bacterial barrier properties, and biocompatibility. In vivo rabbit full‐thickness skin defect study shows that the silk fibroin film effectively reduces the average wound healing time with better skin regeneration compared with the commercial wound dressings. Subsequent assessment in porcine model confirms its long‐term safety and effectiveness for full‐thickness skin defects. Finally, a randomized single‐blind parallel controlled clinical trial with 71 patients shows that the silk fibroin film significantly reduces the time to wound healing and incidence of adverse events compared to commercial dressing. Therefore, the study provides systematic preclinical and clinical evidence that the silk fibroin film promotes wound healing thereby establishing a foundation towards its application for skin repair and regeneration in the clinic.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, the dynamic response of an infinite beam resting on a Pasternak foundation and subjected to arbitrary dynamic loads is developed in the form of analytical solution. The beam responses investigated are deflection, velocity, acceleration, bending moment, and shear force. The mechanical resistance of the Pasternak foundation is modeled using two parameters, that is, one accounts for soil resistance due to compressive strains in the soil and the other accounts for the resistance due to shear strains. Because the Winkler model only represents the compressive resistance of soil, comparatively, the Pasternak model is more realistic to consider shear interactions between the soil springs. The governing equation of the beam is simplified into an algebraic equation by employing integration transforms, so that the analytical solution for the dynamic response of the beam can be obtained conveniently in the frequency domain. Both inverse Laplace and inverse Fourier transforms combined with convolution theorem are applied to convert the solution into the time domain. The solutions for several special cases, such as harmonic line loads, moving line loads, and travelling loads are also discussed and numerical examples are conducted to investigate the influence of the shear modulus of foundation on the beam responses. The proposed solutions can be an effective tool for practitioners. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, natural frequencies and dynamic response of thick beams made of saturated porous materials resting on viscoelastic foundation are investigated for the first time. The beam is modeled using higher-order beam theory. Kelvin-voight model is used to model the viscoelastic foundation. Distribution of porosity along the thickness is considered in two different patterns, which are symmetric nonlinear and nonlinear asymmetric distributions. The relationship between stress and strain is based on the Biot constitutive law. Lagrange equations are used to express the motion equations. Finite element and Newark methods are used to solve the governing equations. The effect of different boundary conditions and various parameters such as porosity and Skempton coefficients, slenderness ratio as well as stiffness and damping coefficients of viscoelastic foundation on natural frequency and transient response of beam have been studied. Results show that in a drained condition, beam has smallest fundamental frequency and by increasing the Skempton coefficient, the fundamental frequency of the beam increases.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Latent change score models (LCS) are conceptually powerful tools for analyzing longitudinal data (McArdle & Hamagami, 2001). However, applications of these models typically include constraints on key parameters over time. Although practically useful, strict invariance over time in these parameters is unlikely in real data. This study investigates the robustness of LCS when invariance over time is incorrectly imposed on key change-related parameters. Monte Carlo simulation methods were used to explore the impact of misspecification on parameter estimation, predicted trajectories of change, and model fit in the dual change score model, the foundational LCS. When constraints were incorrectly applied, several parameters, most notably the slope (i.e., constant change) factor mean and autoproportion coefficient, were severely and consistently biased, as were regression paths to the slope factor when external predictors of change were included. Standard fit indices indicated that the misspecified models fit well, partly because mean level trajectories over time were accurately captured. Loosening constraint improved the accuracy of parameter estimates, but estimates were more unstable, and models frequently failed to converge. Results suggest that potentially common sources of misspecification in LCS can produce distorted impressions of developmental processes, and that identifying and rectifying the situation is a challenge.",

        "abstract": "In this work, an efficient and simple quasi-3D hyperbolic shear deformation theory is developed for bending and vibration analyses of functionally graded (FG) plates resting on two-parameter elastic foundation. The significant feature of this theory is that, in addition to including the thickness stretching effect, it deals with only 5 unknowns as the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT). The foundation is described by the Pasternak (twoparameter) model. The material properties of the plate are assumed to vary continuously in the thickness direction by a simple power law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents. Equations of motion for thick FG plates are obtained within the Hamilton's principle. Analytical solutions for the bending and free vibration analysis are obtained for simply supported plates. The numerical results are given in detail and compared with the existing works such as 3-dimensional solutions and those predicted by other plate theories. It can be concluded that the present theory is not only accurate but also simple in predicting the bending and free vibration responses of functionally graded plates resting on elastic foundation.",

        "abstract": "As species face rapid environmental change, we can build resilient populations through restoration projects that incorporate predicted future climates into seed sourcing decisions. Eucalyptus melliodora is a foundation species of a critically endangered community in Australia that is a target for restoration. We examined patterns of genomic and phenotypic variation to make empirical based recommendations for seed sourcing. We examined isolation by distance and isolation by environment, determining gene flow up to 500 km and associations with environmental variables. Climate chamber studies revealed extensive phenotypic variation both within and among sampling sites, but no site-specific differentiation in phenotypic plasticity. Overall our results suggest that seed can be sourced broadly across the landscape, providing ample diversity for adaptation to environmental change. Application of our landscape genomic model to E. melliodora restoration projects can identify genomic variation suitable for predicted future climates, thereby increasing the long term probability of successful restoration.",

Taking the non-linear developmental trajectories into account (including the possibility to follow the linear developmental pathway), the ASM applies three “roads” to reach this goal, that is, the concentric approach, creating challenging environments, and exploiting transfer. Each of these separately or in combination with each other will increase the level of physical literacy, that is creating more functional variation leading to an increasement of possibilities for adaptation of those involved (athletes, PE teachers, and coaches).

The measurement of the stress or the strain caused by the tower foundation deformation are rarely issued, though the tower status can be possibly assessed by the stress or the strain. A new online monitoring technology of tower foundation deformation of transmission lines is developed which consists of three parts. In the first part, the stress or the strain of the key elements is effectively analyzed under the different deformations such as foundation settlement, inclination, and side-slip with the tower finite element model built and the wind load and ice load applied on the tower. In the second part, the experimental platform of tower stress tests is set up, and the internal relations between the stress variation and the tower foundation deformation are determined. In the third part, the online monitoring technology of tower foundation deformation of transmission lines is developed based on fiber Bragg grating stress sensor and successfully applied in Jibei power grid in China. The results show that all the monitored stresses fluctuating with the wind speed are small in case that the condition of tower foundation is normal; on the contrary, the corresponding stresses will change greatly.",

During suction installation, applied suction under the bucket lid results in seepage flow through the surrounding sand. Seepage flow plays a pivotal role in reducing the penetration resistance, allowing for full penetration despite the initial large soil resistance. However, loosening of the inside soil plug might be problematic when the soil approaches its failure stage, due to soil piping or extensive soil heave inside the bucket foundation. To better understand the interaction between the soil and bucket skirt during suction installation, this paper describes the results of medium-scale tests of bucket foundation installations in sand, comparing jacking and suction installations. Experimental measurements of the pore pressure around the bucket skirt are compared with the numerical simulation results, to validate the finite-element model and to enable analysis of the soil behavior around the skirt.",

Abstract The modal damping ratio for each mode is crucial to characterize the dynamic behavior of offshore wind turbines and widely used by simulation software in wind turbine engineering, such as Bladed and FAST. In this study, modal damping ratios of offshore wind turbines are systematically studied for different soil properties and foundation types. Firstly, the modal damping ratios and modal frequencies for the first and second modes of a gravity foundation–supported offshore wind turbine are studied. An offshore wind turbine supported by a monopile foundation is then investigated to clarify the characteristics of modal damping ratios and modal frequencies for the monopile foundation. The soil parameters are identified by means of genetic algorithm (GA). Predicted modal damping ratios and modal frequencies as well as modal shapes show good agreement with the field measurements for both foundations. Finally, a sensitivity analysis study is carried out to investigate the effects of soil properties and foundation types on modal damping ratios. For the gravity foundation– supported offshore wind turbine, soil properties affect the modal damping ratio of the second mode largely, but affect that of the first mode little, while for the monopile‐supported offshore wind turbine, soil properties affect the modal damping ratios of the first and second modes significantly. Predicted natural periods and modal damping ratios of the first mode for both foundations by a pair of simple models agree well with those by numerical models.",

Before preservation plans can be enacted, it is important to understand how damages occurred as they can affect the overall vulnerability of the structure. This article provides insights into how existing cracks could have occurred on the foundation wall by means of documentation and numerical modeling. Laser scanning was used to capture the geometry of the stones and cracks present in the foundation wall; finite-distinct element modeling was used to reproduce the response of the wall; and fractional distance between simulated and existing conditions was used to compare the results of different loading conditions. The numerical simulations carried out provide results that fit reasonably with the existing damages on the foundation wall and can be used as the basis for future preservation and structural health monitoring efforts.",

This raises a range of ethical dilemmas for journalists, which are particularly serious when their donors are alleged to have been involved in unethical or illegal activities. Although this is a relatively common occurrence in the non-profit sector, so far there has been no critical discussion of these issues in relation to foundation-funded journalism. In this article, we interrogate a rich and detailed case study of the relations between a non-profit news organisation and a donor accused of being involved in a massive, international fraud scandal. We document how the news outlet justified their acceptance of this donor’s money; the defensive strategies they used to protect their reputation, organisational values and editorial freedom; and the conditions that ultimately led to journalists parting ways with the foundation. In so doing, we draw on ideas about philanthrocapitalism, stakeholders and resource dependence in order to develop model of how nonprofits respond to “tainted” donors.",

To quantify the degree of ambiguity, this paper introduces an empirically-applicable, outcome-independent (up to a state space partition), risk-independent, and attitude-independent measure of ambiguity. In the presence of ambiguity, the Bayesian approach can be extended to uncertain probabilities such that aversion to ambiguity is defined as aversion to mean-preserving spreads in these probabilities. Thereby, the degree of ambiguity can be measured by the volatility of probabilities, just as the degree of risk can be measured by the volatility of outcomes. The applicability of this measure is demonstrated by incorporating ambiguity into an asset pricing model.",

        "abstract": "Abstract In the present study, a simple four-unknown exponential shear deformation theory is developed for the bending of functionally graded material (FGM) rectangular plates resting on two-parameter elastic foundation and subjected to nonlinear hygrothermomechanical loading. The elastic properties, coefficient of thermal expansion, and coefficient of moisture expansion of the plate are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction according to a simple power-law distribution in terms of volume fractions of material constituents. Unlike first-order and other higher-order plate theories, the present theory has four independent unknowns. The in-plane displacement field of the present theory uses exponential functions in terms of thickness co-ordinate for calculating out-of-plane shearing strains. The transverse displacement includes bending and shear components. The principle of virtual displacement is employed to derive the governing equations and associated boundary conditions. A Navier solution technique is employed to obtained an analytical solutions. The elastic foundation is modelled as two-parameter Winkler–Pasternak foundation. The numerical results obtained are compared with previously published results wherever possible to prove the efficacy and accuracy of the present theory. The effects of stiffness and gradient index of the foundation on the hygrothermomechanical responses of the plates are discussed.",

        "abstract": "A probabilistic method is presented for identifying the dynamic soil‐foundation stiffnesses of building structures. It is based on model updating of a Timoshenko beam resting on sway and rocking springs, which respectively represent the superstructure and the soil‐foundation system. Unlike those previously employed for this particular problem, the proposed method is a Bayesian one, which accounts for the prevailing uncertainties due to modeling and measurement errors. As such, it yields the probability distribution of the system parameters as opposed to average/deterministic values. In this approach, the joint probability density function of the parameters that control the flexible‐base Timoshenko beam model, together with the fundamental natural frequency and mode shape of the system, forms the prior distribution. Using Bayes' theorem, a posterior distribution is obtained by updating the prior distribution with a sparsely measured mode shape and frequency. The most probable realizations of the system parameters are then determined by maximizing the posterior distribution. For this purpose, first‐ and second‐order derivatives of the objective function are analytically computed via direct differentiation. The proposed method is verified using a synthetic example. Additionally, sensitivity analyses are carried out on both the system parameters and standard deviations of the sources of error. Subsequently, the proposed method is applied to real‐life data recorded at the Millikan Library building, which is located at the California Institute of Technology campus in Pasadena, California, and the results are compared with a previous deterministic study.",

        "abstract": "Fluid-filled tanks in tank farms of industrial plants can experience severe damage and trigger cascading effects in neighboring tanks due to large vibrations induced by strong earthquakes. In order to reduce these tank vibrations, we have explored an innovative type of foundation based on metamaterial concepts. Metamaterials are generally regarded as manmade structures that exhibit unusual responses not readily observed in natural materials. If properly designed, they are able to stop or attenuate wave propagation. Recent studies have shown that if locally resonant structures are periodically placed in a matrix material, the resulting metamaterial forms a phononic lattice that creates a stop band able to forbid elastic wave propagation within a selected band gap frequency range. Conventional phononic lattice structures need huge unit cells for low-frequency vibration shielding, while locally-resonant metamaterials can rely on lattice constants much smaller than the longitudinal wavelengths of propagating waves. Along this line, we have investigated 3D structured foundations with effective attenuation zones conceived as vibration isolation systems for storage tanks. In particular, the three-component periodic foundation cell has been developed using two common construction materials, namely concrete and rubber. Relevant frequency band gaps, computed using the Floquet-Bloch theorem, have been found to be wide and in the low-frequency region. Based on the designed unit cell, a finite foundation has been conceived, checked under static loads and numerically tested on its wave attenuation properties. Then, by means of a parametric study we found a favorable correlation between the shear stiffness of foundation walls and wave attenuation. On this basis, to show the potential improvements of this foundation, we investigated an optimized design by means of analytical models and numerical analyses. In addition, we investigated the influence of cracks in the matrix material on the elastic wave propagation, and by comparing the dispersion curves of the cracked and uncracked materials we found that small cracks have a negligible influence on dispersive properties. Finally, harmonic analysis results displayed that the conceived smart foundations can effectively isolate storage tanks.",

        "abstract": "A separated foundation model was proposed in order to reduce the calculation scale of the numerical model for analyzing soil-bridge structure dynamics. The essence of the wave input analysis model considering soil-structure interaction was analyzed. Based on the large mass method, a one-dimensional time-domain algorithm of the free field was derived. This algorithm could simulate the specified ground motion input well. The displacement expansion solution of the free wave field was solved based on the propagation law of waves in a medium. By separating the soil foundations around the pile foundations of the bridge, the ground motion was transformed into an equivalent load applied on an artificial boundary. The separated foundation model could consider the incoherence effect and soil-structure interaction simultaneously; the number of model elements were reduced, and the computational efficiency was improved. In order to investigate the seismic response of a curved bridge considering soil-structure interaction under spatially varied earthquakes, a curved bridge with small radius was adopted in practical engineering. Spatially correlated multi-point ground motion time histories were generated, and the nonuniform ground motion field was simulated based on the wave input method on an artificial viscoelastic boundary. The effects of different apparent wave velocities, coherence values, and site conditions on the seismic response of the bridge were analyzed. The results showed that the spatial variation of seismic ground motion had a considerable effect on the bending moment and the torsion of the girder. The site effect had great influence on the bending moment of the pier bottom. When considering soil-structure interaction, the spatial variation of ground motion should be fully considered to avoid underestimating the structural response.",

        "abstract": "Presented herein is a novel computational approach using the moving element method (MEM) for simulating the dynamic response of Mindlin plate resting on a viscoelastic foundation and subjected to moving loads. The governing equations and the element mass, damping and stiffness matrices are formulated in a convected coordinate system in which the origin is attached to the point of the moving applied load. Thus, the method simply treats moving loads as ‘stationary’ at the nodes of the plate to avoid updating the locations of moving loads due to the change of the contact points on the plate. To verify the accuracy of the proposed computational approach, static and free vibration analyses of plates are investigated first. Next, the dynamic response of plate resting on a viscoelastic foundation subjected to a moving load is examined. A parametric study is performed to determine the effects of the load’s velocity, foundation damping and foundation stiffness on the dynamic response of a plate. Finally, the comparisons of the dynamic response of plates resting on viscoelastic foundation and subjected to moving vehicles with three models of load (single-wheel, single-axle and tandem-axle) are discussed.",

A two-dimensional direct coupling methodology is proposed to obtain the response of dam-reservoir-foundation system considering fluid-structure and soil-structure interaction simultaneously. The displacement based finite element technique is used to formulate the dam and foundation. The reservoir is modeled by pressure based finite element to reduce the degree of freedoms and there by the computational cost. The responses of dam, reservoir, and foundation with and without fluid-structure, soil-structure and soil-structure-fluid interaction are compared to study the influence of reservoir and soil foundation on the behavior of these respective sub systems. The fundamental frequency of individual sub system decreases with the consideration of coupling effect among these sub systems. On the comparison of the responses of dam, it is observed that the displacement and principal stresses are increased if the effect of reservoir and foundation are considered and the worst responses were observed when both the fluid-structure and soil-structure interaction effects are considered simultaneously. The magnitude and distribution of stresses within the foundation change with the consideration of soil-structure-fluid interaction. Similar to wstresses in the foundation, the hydrodynamic pressure within the reservoir also gets magnified due to interaction effects. The velocity distribution within the reservoir becomes distorted when the fluid-structure and soil-structure-fluid interaction are considered.",

Two geometries of the foundation are considered: either it is infinite or it is semi-infinite with the edges of the plate and of the foundation coinciding. Dispersion relations along with phase and group velocity expressions are obtained. It is shown that the semi-infinite foundation setup exhibits a cut-off frequency which is the same as for a Winkler foundation. The phase velocity possesses a minimum which corresponds to the critical velocity of a moving load. The infinite foundation exhibits a cut-off frequency which depends on its relative stiffness and occurs at a nonzero wavenumber, which is in fact hardly observed in elastodynamics. As a result, the associated phase velocity minimum is admissible only up to a limiting value of the stiffness. In the case of a foundation with small stiffness, asymptotic expansions are derived and beam-like one-dimensional equivalent models are deduced accordingly. It is demonstrated that for the infinite foundation the related nonclassical beam-like model comprises a pseudo-differential operator.",

A generalised view of the system based on category theory is presented, where any system can be considered as a category. The objects of the category represent all the elements and components of the system and the arrows represent the relations between these components (objects). The relationship between these objects are the arrows or the morphisms in the category. The Olog is introduced as a formal language to describe a given real-world situation description and requirement writing. A simple example is provided.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Tunnel construction below or adjacent to piles will affect the performance and eventually the stability of piles due to ground deformation resulting in the movement of piles and changes in the axial force distribution along the piles. A three dimensional finite element analysis using PLAXIS 3D (2013) was performed to study the behaviour of a single pile and 3 x 3 piles group during the advancement of shield tunnelling in ground. The 10-node tetrahedral elements were used to model both the soil and the tunnel lining. The Hardening Soil (HS) model was used to simulate the soil structure interaction at the tunnel-soil interface. An isotropic elastic model was used for the pile, piles cap, tunnel lining and tunnel boring machine shield (TBM). Several parametric studies were attempted including the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical tunnel location relative to pile embedded in different types of soil (clay or sand). The results showed that the pile head settlement increases during the tunnelling advancement in larger values than that for ground surface settlement. A zone of influence was determined in the range of twice the tunnel diameter in the longitudinal direction (forward and backward of the pile), and transverse direction (left and right of the tunnel centreline). If the tunnel boring is kept off this zone then there is no fear of pile collapse.",

The UDA model conceptualises design activity as a process consisting of three core actions: information action, knowledge-sharing action, and representation action, which are linked via uncertainty perception. The foundations of the UDA model in the design literature are elaborated in terms of the three core actions and their links to designer cognition and behaviour, utilising definitions and concepts from Activity Theory. The practical relevance and theoretical contributions of the UDA model are discussed. This paper contributes to the design literature by offering a comprehensive formalisation of design activity of individual designers, which connects cognition and action, to provide a foundation for understanding previously disparate descriptions of design activity.",

It is about the computations that cause a machine to make a claim and to assign a high degree of certainty to the claim. The theory is offered as a possible starting point for building artificial consciousness. Given current technology, it should be possible to build a machine that contains a rich internal model of what consciousness is, attributes that property of consciousness to itself and to the people it interacts with, and uses that attribution to make predictions about human behavior. Such a machine would “believe” it is conscious and act like it is conscious, in the same sense that the human machine believes and acts.",

Patient-specific factors, including comorbidities, mental health, social support, and preinjury function need to be accounted for in our assessment, because all of these factors have demonstrated an impact on outcomes. Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of how they can transition their practice in an era of value-based health care in a manner that will benefit their patients and provide insight into their own clinical practice.

        "abstract": "Bottom-fixed offshore wind turbines (OWTs) involve a wide range of engineering fields. Of these, modelling of foundation flexibility has been given little priority. This paper investigates the modelling of bottom-fixed OWTs in the non-linear aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulation tool FAST v7. The OWTs considered is supported on a monopile. The objective of this paper was to implement a non-linear foundation model in this software. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's idealized 5MW reference turbine was used as a base for the analyses.\r\n\r\nDefault modelling of foundation in FAST v7 is by means of a rigid foundation. This implies that soil stiffness and damping is disregarded. Damping may lead to lower design loads. A softer foundation, on the other hand, will increase the natural periods of the system, shifting them closer to the frequencies of the environmental loads. This may in turn lead to amplified moments at the mudline. Therefore, it is important to include soil stiffness and damping in analyses.\r\n\r\nIn this paper, a non-linear foundation model is introduced in FAST v7 by means of uncoupled parallel springs. To verify that the implementation is successful, non-linear load-displacement curves of the foundation spring are presented. These show the typical hysteresis loops of an inelastic material, which confirms the implementation. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents two case studies of the dynamic response of a ballastless track, X-section cast-in-place concrete (XCC) pile–raft (referred to as BTXPR) foundation embedded in sand subsoil. Model tests were conducted at a scale of 1/5 using a 7 m deep box with cross-sectional dimensions of 5 m × 4 m. In one case the box was filled with subsoil consisting of air-dried sand, whereas in the other case the box was filled with saturated sand. The tests involved measurement and analysis of the response in velocity under different applied cyclic load frequencies. It has been shown that the magnitude and variation of vibration velocity in the BTXPR foundation are closely related to the degree of saturation of the subsoil. Due to the existence of pore water in the saturated sand subsoil, the first natural frequency of the BTXPR foundation embedded in saturated sand is 5 Hz lower than that in air-dried sand. In addition, the amplitude of vibration velocity of the BTXPR foundation embedded in the saturated sand ...",

Proper deep foundation pit design requires proper exit distribution. However, calculating an adequate number of exit distributions for evaluation is difficult due to the numerous influential factors existing in the deep foundation pit environment. To this end, this paper presents a prototype of a decision-making system that uses agent-based modeling to simulate deep foundation pit evacuation in the presence of collapse disaster. By modeling the collapse occurrence process and agent escape process, an agent-based evacuation model is built, and a modified simulation-based particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem of exit distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the system, and the results show that the system provides a feasible framework for deep foundation pit evacuation.",

However, the lack of a sound mathematical foundation presents itself as a real challenge amidst the swarm of big data marketing activities. This paper intends to propose a possible mathematical theory as a foundation for big data research. Specifically, we propose the concept of the adjective “big” as a mathematical operator, furthermore, the concept of so-called “big” logically and naturally fits the concept of being “linguistics variable” as per fuzzy logic research community for decades. The consequence of adopting such a mathematical modeling can be profoundly considered as an abstraction of the technologies, systems, tools for data management and processing that transforms data into big data. In addition, the concept of infinity of the big data is based on the theory of calculus and the set theory. Furthermore, the concept of relativity of the big data, as we find out, is based on the operations of the fuzzy subsets theory. The proposed approach in this paper, we hope, can facilitate and open up more opportunities for big data research and developments on big data analytics, business analytics, big data intelligence, big data computing as well as big data science.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims at clarifying the role of dynamic soil–structure interaction in the seismic assessment of structure and foundation, when the non‐linear coupling of both subsystems is accounted for. For this purpose, the seismic assessment of an ideal set of bridge piers on shallow foundations is considered. After an initial standard assessment, based on capacity design principles, the evaluation of the seismic response of the piers is carried out by dynamic simulations, where both the non‐linear responses of the superstructure and of the foundation are accounted for, in the latter case through the macro‐element modeling of the soil–foundation system. The results of the dynamic simulations point out the beneficial effects of the non‐linear response of the foundation, which provides a substantial contribution to the overall energy dissipation during seismic excitation, thus allowing the structural ductility demand to decrease significantly with respect to a standard fixed‐base or linear‐elastic base assessment. Permanent deformations at the foundation level, such as rotation and settlement, turn out to be of limited amount. Therefore, an advanced assessment approach of the integrated non‐linear system, consisting of the interacting foundation and superstructure, is expected to provide more rationale and economic results than the standard uncoupled approach, which, neglecting any energy dissipation at the foundation level, generally overestimates the ductility demand on the superstructure.

Furthermore, the report examines the practical steps needed to ensure transparent accounting of taxed transactions in order to avoid long term negative effects for media and democracy.

Several theories of suicide have been proposed since the beginning of the past century, and a myriad of neurobiological studies have been conducted over the past two decades in order to elucidate its pathophysiology. Both neurobiology and psychological theories tend to work in parallel lines that need behavioral and empirical data respectively, to confirm their hypotheses. In this review, we are proposing a “Life Span Model of Suicide” with an attempt to integrate the “Stress-Diathesis Model” and the “Interpersonal Model of Suicide” into a neurobiological narrative and support it by providing a thorough compilation of related genetic, epigenetic, and gene expression findings. This proposed model comprises three layers, forming the capability of suicide: genetic factors as the predisposing Diathesis on one side and Stress, characterized by epigenetic marks on the other side, and in between gene expression and gene function which are thought to be influenced by Diathesis and Stress components. The empirical evidence of this model is yet to be confirmed and further research, specifically epigenetic studies in particular, are needed to support the presence of a life-long, evolving capability of suicide and identify its neurobiological correlates.",

Meanwhile, the number of qualified materials in certain areas is limited, difficult to obtain and expensive. Therefore, efforts are required to exploit the potential of local soils as a qualified road foundation material. One of them is laterite soil which is only wasted from mining activities. This study aims to analyze and produce the characteristics of laterite soil with lime stabilization to be used as a road foundation. Physical and mechanical properties, mineral content, and chemical composition, obtained from laboratory testing. Meanwhile, to obtain soil bearing capacity, the physical model of the road foundation was examined. The addition of lime with compositions of 3, 5, 7, and 10% at maximum dry density from Proctor standard test, then cured to 3, 7, 14, and 28 days before testing. Subsequently, the soil mixture is fed into the test tub with length (L) = 8m, width (W) = 2m, and height (H) = 2.5m. The physical model of road foundation consists of a subgrade soil with 1.5 m thickness and above the subgrade is placed lime treated base with 0.1 m thickness. Dial gauge to read the magnitute of vertical deformation occurs when loading is placed on surface with 0.2 m distance. Furthermore, static loading test on each mixture of lime treated base. The results show that, stabilization of 10% lime for 28 days curing time yields the strength and bearing capacity of the soil three times higher than soil before stabilization. Subgrade modulus increased significantly with increasing of lime content and curing time. Comparing the relation of subgrade modulus and CBR values for common soil and sediment soil with cement stabilization, it was found that performance of laterite soil with lime stabilization is better than sediment soil with cement stabilization and approaching of common soil. It is concluded that laterite soil with lime stabilization has potential as a road foundation.",

This article proposed an improved model based on the vibration signal analysis to investigate the onshore wind turbine dynamic behavior. The model is formulated using the Euler–Lagrangian approach in which the dynamic interaction effects between the nacelle and the tower and the effects between the tower and the foundation are considered. The nacelle is assumed as a mass with 2 degrees of freedom at the top of a flexible tower. And the tower is considered as a beam with elastic end support. The foundation stiffness can influence the dynamic response of wind turbines due to the soft soils surrounding the tower base. A rotational spring and a lateral spring derived from the foundation are used to reflect the interaction between the tower and the foundation. Finally, a comparison with existing National Renewable Energy Laboratory 5-MW baseline wind turbine model is performed. And a field experiment has been implemented to validate the model. The vibration signal of the nacelle and the tower is analyzed to determine the model parameters. Results show that the proposed model is accurate and practical for dynamic property analysis of wind turbine.",

Psycholexical taxonomies from around the world will be considered, as well as taxonomies based on nouns, verbs, adverbs, and their combinations. Ongoing controversies, difficulties, and disputes regarding alternative psycholexical personality structures will be considered, as well as recommendations for future research.",

        "abstract": "The bottom-supported foundation is the most important component of offshore platforms, as it provides the major support to the upper structure. The buoyancy of the bottom-supported foundation is a critical issue in platform design because it counteracts parts of the vertical loads. In this paper, a model box was designed and installed with earth pressure transducers and pore pressure transducers to simulate the sitting process of the bottom-supported foundation. The buoyancy acting on the model box was calculated on the basis of two different methods, i.e., the water pressure difference between top and bottom surface and the effective stress at the bottom of the model. Field tests with different sitting times were carried out on the saturated soft clay seabed. Numerical coupled analysis was performed to verify the dissipation of the excess pore pressure at the bottom of the model. The results showed that the buoyancy of the model could reach twice the calculated value of Archimedes’ law in the initial stage, however, it eventually stabilized near the theoretical value as the excess pore pressure dissipated. There was a slight fluctuation in buoyancy due to the phase lag of the pore pressure response caused by the low permeability of the seabed.",

        "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the vertical penetration resistance of conical spudcan and flat footings in layered soils. Centrifuge tests are reported for a clay bed with strength increasing with depth interbedded with dense and medium dense sand. Both non-visualising (full-model) and visualising (half-model) tests were conducted with high-quality digital images captured and analysed using the particle image velocimetry technique for the latter. The load–displacement curves often show a reduction in resistance on passing through the sand layers, which creates a risk of punch-through failure for the foundations when supporting a jack-up drilling unit. For a given foundation, the peak punch-through capacity (qpeak) is dependent on the thickness of both the overlying clay and the sand layer. The failure mechanism associated with the peak resistance in the sand layer involves entrapment of a thin band of top clay above the sand layer that subsequently shears along an inclined failure surface before being pushe...",

        "abstract": "Abstract We introduce the notion of implicative algebra, a simple algebraic structure intended to factorize the model-theoretic constructions underlying forcing and realizability (both in intuitionistic and classical logic). The salient feature of this structure is that its elements can be seen both as truth values and as (generalized) realizers, thus blurring the frontier between proofs and types. We show that each implicative algebra induces a (Set-based) tripos, using a construction that is reminiscent from the construction of a realizability tripos from a partial combinatory algebra. Relating this construction with the corresponding constructions in forcing and realizability, we conclude that the class of implicative triposes encompasses all forcing triposes (both intuitionistic and classical), all classical realizability triposes (in the sense of Krivine), and all intuitionistic realizability triposes built from partial combinatory algebras.",

        "abstract": "Today, phase A studies of future space systems are often conducted in special design facilities such as the Concurrent Engineering Facility at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Within these facilities, the studies are performed following a defined process making use of a data model for information exchange. Quite often it remains unclear what exactly such a data model is and how it is implemented and applied. Nowadays, such a data model is usually a software using a formal specification describing its capabilities within a so-called meta-model. This meta-model, often referred as conceptual data model, is finally used and instantiated as system model during these concurrent engineering studies. Such software also provides a user interface for instantiating and sharing the system model within the design team and it provides capabilities to analyze the system model on the fly. This is possible due to the semantics of the underlying conceptual data model creating a common language used to exchange and process design information. This article explains the implementation of the data model at DLR and shows information how it is applied in the concurrent engineering process of the Concurrent Engineering Facility. It highlights important aspects concerning the modeling capabilities during a study and discusses how they can be implemented into a corresponding conceptual data model. Accordingly, the article presents important aspects such as rights management and data consistency and the implications of them to the software’s underlying technology. A special use case of the data model is depicted and shows the flexibility of the implementation proven by a study of a multi-module space station.",

        "abstract": "Many voting systems rely on art, rather than science, to ensure that votes are freely made, with equal influence. Such systems build upon creativity and skill, rather than scientific foundations. These systems are routinely broken in ways that compromise free-choice or permit undue influence. Breaks can be avoided by proving that voting systems satisfy formal notions of voters voting freely and of detecting undue influence. This manuscript provides a detailed technical introduction to a definition of ballot secrecy by Smyth that formalises the former notion and a definition of verifiability by Smyth, Frink & Clarkson that formalises the latter. The definitions are presented in the computational model of cryptography: Ballot secrecy is expressed as the inability to distinguish between an instance of the voting system in which voters cast some votes, from another instance in which the voters cast a permutation of those votes. Verifiability decomposes into individual verifiability, which is expressed as the inability to cause a collision between ballots, and universal verifiability, which is expressed as the inability to cause an incorrect election outcome to be accepted. The definitions are complimented with simple examples that demonstrate the essence of these properties and detailed proofs are constructed to show how secrecy and verifiability can be formally proved. Finally, the Helios and Helios Mixnet voting systems are presented as case studies to provide an understanding of state-of-the-art systems that are being used for binding elections.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - Understanding a lack of strategy execution research, especially a lack of execution frameworks, the purpose of this paper is to focus on building a model of one of the most classic aspects of effective strategy execution, i.e. alignment. The proposed framework of alignment demonstrates linkages among different factors of alignment and suggests a managerial action plan to successfully convert strategic goals into execution performance. Design/methodology/approach - This study develops an empirically tested framework of “alignment” that can be used to plan effective strategy execution. The research context of the study is the firms operating in the infrastructure sector of India. A multi-method approach, combining qualitative and quantitative techniques, has been adopted with emphasis on the interpretation of the framework to suggest managerial actions. Findings - This study shows that structure-strategy linkage is the most fundamental task of strategy execution. However, there are other aspects of alignment also that are critical. Also, there exist hierarchical relationships among different alignments. The structural understanding of alignment is required to set strong foundation for execution process. Research limitations/implications - This study is limited to firms in the infrastructure sector of India. A questionnaire survey approach may invite some bias in response. Also, a large sample size could have been more useful to generalize findings. The proposed framework in this study suggest that the alignment of structure with strategy is important but not sufficient for effective strategy execution. There exist hierarchical relationships, among the factors of alignment, showing a dependence-driving relationship. Practical implications - Strategy execution is one of the biggest challenges that corporations have been facing. The existing literature has identified many issues leading to effective strategy execution. The “alignment” aspect of execution has been the most talked about. There are different levels of alignment required for successful strategy execution. Literature suggests some of the key areas of alignment. However, there has been a lack of frameworks demonstrating linkages among different alignments to facilitate effective strategy execution. Originality/value - There is a lack of strategy execution frameworks, especially reflecting on the alignment aspect of strategy execution. This study focuses not only on “how” of the framework development but also on the “why” aspect of the same. The interpretation approach also helps in pondering on the contextual realities.",

The paper analyses testing results of a bucket foundation model exposed to cyclic tensile loading. The model, with dimensions of 1 m in diameter and 0.5 m in skirt length, was, installed in dense water-saturated sand. Slow monotonic loading tests and cyclic tensile loading tests were performed (up to 40 000 load cycles) including tests with mean cyclic loading in tension, which is a unique testing condition. High-quality data were documented for load, displacement, and pore pressure response. Conclusions have been drawn regarding static and cyclic loading stiffness and displacement development during long-term cyclic loading. Four cyclic loading tests induced partially drained soil conditions and showed that pore pressure can accumulate during the long-term loading. Post-cyclic monotonic tensile loading tests showed up to 25% reduction in load capacity of the foundation. The research results provide valuable informat...",

However, the similarities and differences of these theories are not clearly articulated. This article has reviewed key scholarly literature in this field and found that major theories of development stem from three foundational models: modernist, dependency and post-development. The modernist model assumes that development a form of positive change in human societies, occurs in stages and has a fixed route applicable to all societies. The dependency model, on the other hand, challenges the assumptions of the modernist model and argues that the socio-economic prosperity of developing countries is not possible without dismantling the global capitalistic system. Finally, the post-development model challenges the assumptions of the modernist and dependency models and argues that development is an ideological discourse constructed by the West and hence we need alternatives to development theories.",

In order to boost the representational power of a network, several recent approaches have shown the benefit of enhancing spatial encoding. In this work, we focus on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the \"Squeeze-and-Excitation\" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We demonstrate that by stacking these blocks together, we can construct SENet architectures that generalise extremely well across challenging datasets. Crucially, we find that SE blocks produce significant performance improvements for existing state-of-the-art deep architectures at minimal additional computational cost. SENets formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and significantly reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, achieving a ~25% relative improvement over the winning entry of 2016.

        "title": "Why Are Some STEM Fields More Gender Balanced Than Others?",
        "abstract": "Women obtain more than half of U.S. undergraduate degrees in biology, chemistry, and mathematics, yet they earn less than 20% of computer science, engineering, and physics undergraduate degrees (National Science Foundation, 2014a). Gender differences in interest in computer science, engineering, and physics appear even before college. Why are women represented in some science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields more than others? We conduct a critical review of the most commonly cited factors explaining gender disparities in STEM participation and investigate whether these factors explain differential gender participation across STEM fields. Math performance and discrimination influence who enters STEM, but there is little evidence to date that these factors explain why women’s underrepresentation is relatively worse in some STEM fields. We introduce a model with three overarching factors to explain the larger gender gaps in participation in computer science, engineering, and physics than in biology, chemistry, and mathematics: (a) masculine cultures that signal a lower sense of belonging to women than men, (b) a lack of sufficient early experience with computer science, engineering, and physics, and (c) gender gaps in self-efficacy. Efforts to increase women’s participation in computer science, engineering, and physics may benefit from changing masculine cultures and providing students with early experiences that signal equally to both girls and boys that they belong and can succeed in these fields.",

        "title": "TRY plant trait database - enhanced coverage and open access.",
        "abstract": "Plant traits-the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants-determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits-almost complete coverage for 'plant growth form'. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait-environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives.",

        "abstract": "Since the invention of word2vec, the skip-gram model has significantly advanced the research of network embedding, such as the recent emergence of the DeepWalk, LINE, PTE, and node2vec approaches. In this work, we show that all of the aforementioned models with negative sampling can be unified into the matrix factorization framework with closed forms. Our analysis and proofs reveal that: (1) DeepWalk empirically produces a low-rank transformation of a network's normalized Laplacian matrix; (2) LINE, in theory, is a special case of DeepWalk when the size of vertices' context is set to one; (3) As an extension of LINE, PTE can be viewed as the joint factorization of multiple networks» Laplacians; (4) node2vec is factorizing a matrix related to the stationary distribution and transition probability tensor of a 2nd-order random walk. We further provide the theoretical connections between skip-gram based network embedding algorithms and the theory of graph Laplacian. Finally, we present the NetMF method as well as its approximation algorithm for computing network embedding. Our method offers significant improvements over DeepWalk and LINE for conventional network mining tasks. This work lays the theoretical foundation for skip-gram based network embedding methods, leading to a better understanding of latent network representation learning.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe systematic evaluation of the results of time-series studies of air pollution is challenged by differences in model specification and publication bias.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe evaluated the associations of inhalable particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm or less (PM10) and fine PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) with daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality across multiple countries or regions. Daily data on mortality and air pollution were collected from 652 cities in 24 countries or regions. We used overdispersed generalized additive models with random-effects meta-analysis to investigate the associations. Two-pollutant models were fitted to test the robustness of the associations. Concentration-response curves from each city were pooled to allow global estimates to be derived.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOn average, an increase of 10 μg per cubic meter in the 2-day moving average of PM10 concentration, which represents the average over the current and previous day, was associated with increases of 0.44% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.50) in daily all-cause mortality, 0.36% (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.43) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.58) in daily respiratory mortality. The corresponding increases in daily mortality for the same change in PM2.5 concentration were 0.68% (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.77), 0.55% (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.66), and 0.74% (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.95). These associations remained significant after adjustment for gaseous pollutants. Associations were stronger in locations with lower annual mean PM concentrations and higher annual mean temperatures. The pooled concentration-response curves showed a consistent increase in daily mortality with increasing PM concentration, with steeper slopes at lower PM concentrations.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nOur data show independent associations between short-term exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 and daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality in more than 600 cities across the globe. These data reinforce the evidence of a link between mortality and PM concentration established in regional and local studies.

Traditional machine learning approaches need to combine all data at one location, typically a data center, which may very well violate the laws on user privacy and data confidentiality. Today, many parts of the world demand that technology companies treat user data carefully according to user-privacy laws. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a prime example. In this book, we describe how federated machine learning addresses this problem with novel solutions combining distributed machine learning, cryptography and security, and incentive mechanism design based on economic principles and game theory. We explain different types of privacypreserving machine learning solutions and their technological backgrounds, and highlight some representative practical use cases.We show how federated learning can become the foundation of next-generation machine learning that caters to technological and societal needs for responsible AI development and application.",

        "abstract": "Data from experiments and direct simulations of turbulence have historically been used to calibrate simple engineering models such as those based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations. In the past few years, with the availability of large and diverse data sets, researchers have begun to explore methods to systematically inform turbulence models with data, with the goal of quantifying and reducing model uncertainties. This review surveys recent developments in bounding uncertainties in RANS models via physical constraints, in adopting statistical inference to characterize model coefficients and estimate discrepancy, and in using machine learning to improve turbulence models. Key principles, achievements, and challenges are discussed. A central perspective advocated in this review is that by exploiting foundational knowledge in turbulence modeling and physical constraints, researchers can use data-driven approaches to yield useful predictive models.",

        "abstract": "Aerosols interact with radiation and clouds. Substantial progress made over the past 40 years in observing, understanding, and modeling these processes helped quantify the imbalance in the Earth's radiation budget caused by anthropogenic aerosols, called aerosol radiative forcing, but uncertainties remain large. This review provides a new range of aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial era based on multiple, traceable, and arguable lines of evidence, including modeling approaches, theoretical considerations, and observations. Improved understanding of aerosol absorption and the causes of trends in surface radiative fluxes constrain the forcing from aerosol‐radiation interactions. A robust theoretical foundation and convincing evidence constrain the forcing caused by aerosol‐driven increases in liquid cloud droplet number concentration. However, the influence of anthropogenic aerosols on cloud liquid water content and cloud fraction is less clear, and the influence on mixed‐phase and ice clouds remains poorly constrained. Observed changes in surface temperature and radiative fluxes provide additional constraints. These multiple lines of evidence lead to a 68% confidence interval for the total aerosol effective radiative forcing of ‐1.6 to ‐0.6 W m−2, or ‐2.0 to ‐0.4 W m−2 with a 90% likelihood. Those intervals are of similar width to the last Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment but shifted toward more negative values. The uncertainty will narrow in the future by continuing to critically combine multiple lines of evidence, especially those addressing industrial‐era changes in aerosol sources and aerosol effects on liquid cloud amount and on ice clouds.",

        "abstract": "Sensors in everyday devices, such as our phones, wearables, and computers, leave a stream of digital traces. Personal sensing refers to collecting and analyzing data from sensors embedded in the context of daily life with the aim of identifying human behaviors, thoughts, feelings, and traits. This article provides a critical review of personal sensing research related to mental health, focused principally on smartphones, but also including studies of wearables, social media, and computers. We provide a layered, hierarchical model for translating raw sensor data into markers of behaviors and states related to mental health. Also discussed are research methods as well as challenges, including privacy and problems of dimensionality. Although personal sensing is still in its infancy, it holds great promise as a method for conducting mental health research and as a clinical tool for monitoring at-risk populations and providing the foundation for the next generation of mobile health (or mHealth) interventions.",

        "abstract": "The Dakota (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications) toolkit provides a flexible and extensible interface between simulation codes and iterative analysis methods. Dakota contains algorithms for optimization with gradient and nongradient-based methods; uncertainty quantification with sampling, reliability, and stochastic expansion methods; parameter estimation with nonlinear least squares methods; and sensitivity/variance analysis with design of experiments and parameter study methods. These capabilities may be used on their own or as components within advanced strategies such as surrogate-based optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming, or optimization under uncertainty. By employing object-oriented design to implement abstractions of the key components required for iterative systems analyses, the Dakota toolkit provides a flexible and extensible problem-solving environment for design and performance analysis of computational models on high performance computers. This report serves as a theoretical manual for selected algorithms implemented within the Dakota software. It is not intended as a comprehensive theoretical treatment, since a number of existing texts cover general optimization theory, statistical analysis, and other introductory topics. Rather, this manual is intended to summarize a set of Dakota-related research publications in the areas of surrogate-based optimization, uncertainty quantification, and optimization under uncertainty that provide the foundation for many of Dakota’s iterative analysis capabilities.

The model consists of two subsystems of vehicle and track in which the vehicle subsystem is modelled as a multi-body system with 10 DOFs running on the track with a constant velocity, and the track substructure as an infinite Euler beam supported on a discrete-continuous elastic foundation consisting of the three layers of rail, sleeper, and ballast. The interface between these two subsystems is the wheel / rail interaction described by Hertzian nonlinear elastic contact theory. In order to get numerical results of such a complex system, a new simple fast integration method is adopted. And typical numerical results are compared with field measured data to verify the detailed model. Finally, the model is applied to analysing the wheel / rail dynamic interactions in high-speed rail and in heavy haul railway.",

The scientific community has mounted a strong response by accelerating research and innovation, and has quickly set the foundation for understanding the molecular determinants of the disease for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions. The replication of the viral genome within the infected cells is a key stage of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. It is a complex process involving the action of several viral and host proteins in order to perform RNA polymerization, proofreading and final capping. This review provides an update of the structural and functional data on the key actors of the replicatory machinery of SARS-CoV-2, to fill the gaps in the currently available structural data, which is mainly obtained through homology modeling. Moreover, learning from similar viruses, we collect data from the literature to reconstruct the pattern of interactions among the protein actors of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA polymerase machinery. Here, an important role is played by co-factors such as Nsp8 and Nsp10, not only as allosteric activators but also as molecular connectors that hold the entire machinery together to enhance the efficiency of RNA replication.",

To support this effort, we gather a large-scale dataset of hands in contact with objects consisting of 131 days of footage as well as a 100K annotated hand-contact video frame dataset. The learned model on this dataset can serve as a foundation for hand-contact understanding in videos.

Such progress establishes a foundation for well-grounded research into THz-specific signal processing techniques for wireless communications. This tutorial overviews these techniques, emphasizing ultramassive multiple-input–multiple-output (UM-MIMO) systems and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, vital for overcoming the distance problem at very high frequencies. We focus on the classical problems of waveform design and modulation, beamforming and precoding, index modulation, channel estimation, channel coding, and data detection.

In large part, this was fueled by advances in genomic technology, enabling us to examine genome‐wide genetic variants across diverse genetic materials. The development of the mixed model framework for GWAS dramatically reduced the number of false positives compared with naïve methods. Building on this foundation, many methods have since been developed to increase computational speed or improve statistical power in GWAS. These methods have allowed the detection of genomic variants associated with either traditional agronomic phenotypes or biochemical and molecular phenotypes. In turn, these associations enable applications in gene cloning and in accelerated crop breeding through marker assisted selection or genetic engineering. Current topics of investigation include rare‐variant analysis, synthetic associations, optimizing the choice of GWAS model, and utilizing GWAS results to advance knowledge of biological processes. Ongoing research in these areas will facilitate further advances in GWAS methods and their applications.",

However, unlike inference, training with numbers represented with less than 16 bits has been challenging due to the need to maintain fidelity of the gradient computations during back-propagation. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the successful training of deep neural networks using 8-bit floating point numbers while fully maintaining the accuracy on a spectrum of deep learning models and datasets. In addition to reducing the data and computation precision to 8 bits, we also successfully reduce the arithmetic precision for additions (used in partial product accumulation and weight updates) from 32 bits to 16 bits through the introduction of a number of key ideas including chunk-based accumulation and floating point stochastic rounding. The use of these novel techniques lays the foundation for a new generation of hardware training platforms with the potential for 2-4 times improved throughput over today's systems.",

However, privacy issues and the subsequent inefficiency are dragging down the performances of fog computing. The majority of existing works hardly consider a reasonable balance between them while suffering from poisoning attacks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel blockchain-enabled federated learning (FL-Block) scheme to close the gap. FL-Block allows local learning updates of end devices exchanges with a blockchain-based global learning model, which is verified by miners. Built upon this, FL-Block enables the autonomous machine learning without any centralized authority to maintain the global model and coordinates by using a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism of the blockchain. Furthermore, we analyze the latency performance of FL-Block and further derive the optimal block generation rate by taking communication, consensus delays, and computation cost into consideration. Extensive evaluation results show the superior performances of FL-Block from the aspects of privacy protection, efficiency, and resistance to the poisoning attack.",

        "abstract": "Vision transformers have delivered tremendous success in representation learning. This is primarily due to effective token mixing through self attention. However, this scales quadratically with the number of pixels, which becomes infeasible for high-resolution inputs. To cope with this challenge, we propose Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) as an efficient token mixer that learns to mix in the Fourier domain. AFNO is based on a principled foundation of operator learning which allows us to frame token mixing as a continuous global convolution without any dependence on the input resolution. This principle was previously used to design FNO, which solves global convolution efficiently in the Fourier domain and has shown promise in learning challenging PDEs. To handle challenges in visual representation learning such as discontinuities in images and high resolution inputs, we propose principled architectural modifications to FNO which results in memory and computational efficiency. This includes imposing a block-diagonal structure on the channel mixing weights, adaptively sharing weights across tokens, and sparsifying the frequency modes via soft-thresholding and shrinkage. The resulting model is highly parallel with a quasi-linear complexity and has linear memory in the sequence size. AFNO outperforms self-attention mechanisms for few-shot segmentation in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. For Cityscapes segmentation with the Segformer-B3 backbone, AFNO can handle a sequence size of 65k and outperforms other efficient self-attention mechanisms.",

To perform this task, we combined the collective knowledge of 67 soil-erosion scientists from 25 countries. The resulting database, named ‘Global Applications of Soil Erosion Modelling Tracker (GASEMT)’, includes 3030 individual modelling records from 126 countries, encompassing all continents (except Antarctica). Out of the 8471 articles identified as potentially relevant, we reviewed 1697 appropriate articles and systematically evaluated and transferred 42 relevant attributes into the database. This GASEMT database provides comprehensive insights into the state-of-the-art of soil- erosion models and model applications worldwide. This database intends to support the upcoming country-based United Nations global soil-erosion assessment in addition to helping to inform soil erosion research priorities by building a foundation for future targeted, in-depth analyses.

        "title": "Machine Learning on Graphs: A Model and Comprehensive Taxonomy",
        "abstract": "There has been a surge of recent interest in learning representations for graph-structured data. Graph representation learning methods have generally fallen into three main categories, based on the availability of labeled data. The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure. However, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly little work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap between graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization models. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods for graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work. Specifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model (GRAPHEDM), which generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g. GraphSage, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and unsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. DeepWalk, node2vec, etc) into a single consistent approach. To illustrate the generality of this approach, we fit over thirty existing methods into this framework. We believe that this unifying view both provides a solid foundation for understanding the intuition behind these methods, and enables future research in the area.",

        "abstract": "Generative models of 3D human motion are often restricted to a small number of activities and can therefore not generalize well to novel movements or applications. In this work we propose a deep learning framework for human motion capture data that learns a generic representation from a large corpus of motion capture data and generalizes well to new, unseen, motions. Using an encoding-decoding network that learns to predict future 3D poses from the most recent past, we extract a feature representation of human motion. Most work on deep learning for sequence prediction focuses on video and speech. Since skeletal data has a different structure, we present and evaluate different network architectures that make different assumptions about time dependencies and limb correlations. To quantify the learned features, we use the output of different layers for action classification and visualize the receptive fields of the network units. Our method outperforms the recent state of the art in skeletal motion prediction even though these use action specific training data. Our results show that deep feedforward networks, trained from a generic mocap database, can successfully be used for feature extraction from human motion data and that this representation can be used as a foundation for classification and prediction.",

A few characteristics of the task might lead one to think that BERT is not the most appropriate model: syntactic structures matter less for content categories, documents can often be longer than typical BERT input, and documents often have multiple labels. Nevertheless, we show that a straightforward classification model using BERT is able to achieve the state of the art across four popular datasets. To address the computational expense associated with BERT inference, we distill knowledge from BERT-large to small bidirectional LSTMs, reaching BERT-base parity on multiple datasets using 30x fewer parameters. The primary contribution of our paper is improved baselines that can provide the foundation for future work.",

In this paper, we make a substantial step forward toward understanding this foundational question. By introducing a number of computational statistical techniques and based on 14 large-scale data sets, which consist of 113.3 million real-world passwords, we, for the first time, propose two Zipf-like models (i.e., PDF-Zipf and CDF-Zipf) to characterize the distribution of passwords. More specifically, our PDF-Zipf model can well fit the popular passwords and obtain a coefficient of determination larger than 0.97; our CDF-Zipf model can well fit the entire password data set, with the maximum cumulative distribution function (CDF) deviation between the empirical distribution and the fitted theoretical model being 0.49%~4.59% (on an average 1.85%). With the concrete knowledge of password distributions, we suggest a new metric for measuring the strength of password data sets. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and general applicability of the proposed Zipf-like models and security metric.",

        "abstract": "Due to physical limitations, mobile devices are restricted in memory, battery, processing, among other characteristics. This results in many applications that cannot be run in such devices. This problem is fixed by Edge Cloud Computing, where the users offload tasks they cannot run to cloudlet servers in the edge of the network. The main requirement of such a system is having a low Service Delay, which would correspond to a high Quality of Service. This paper presents a method for minimizing Service Delay in a scenario with two cloudlet servers. The method has a dual focus on computation and communication elements, controlling Processing Delay through virtual machine migration and improving Transmission Delay with Transmission Power Control. The foundation of the proposal is a mathematical model of the scenario, whose analysis is used on a comparison between the proposed approach and two other conventional methods; these methods have single focus and only make an effort to improve either Transmission Delay or Processing Delay, but not both. As expected, the proposal presents the lowest Service Delay in all study cases, corroborating our conclusion that a dual focus approach is the best way to tackle the Service Delay problem in Edge Cloud Computing.",

This research highlights the EFQM 2020 model’s novelties and its relationships/implications with the Industry 4.0 paradigm, contributing to the Quality 4.0 body of knowledge. Several linkages between the EFQM 2020 model and Industry 4.0 have been identified, namely, at the criteria level and guidance points, which can support successful digital transformation by combining quality and excellence with Industry 4.0. However, given the model’s generic and non-prescriptive nature, there is no specific reference to the nine Industry 4.0 pillars. Additionally, the links between direction and organizational culture and leadership criteria and driving performance and transformation are not evident, which might be a concern for business and technology transformation strategies. Managing knowledge, skills, and capabilities is critical for the successful adoption of Industry 4.0. The EFQM model adds a strategic and technologically unbiased perspective to Industry 4.0, providing an integrated business excellence framework for Quality 4.0. With empirical support of the model application, future research is recommended to develop this subject further.",

Variations in these resources predict large academic disparities among children from different socioeconomic backgrounds that persist over the years of schooling, perpetuating educational inequalities across generations. In this article, we provide an overview of a model that has guided our approach to studying these influences, focusing particularly on parent educational attainment. Parents’ educational attainment typically drives their occupations and income and is often used interchangeably with SES in research. We posit that parent educational attainment provides a foundation that supports children’s academic success indirectly through parents’ beliefs about and expectations for their children, as well as through the cognitive stimulation that parents provide in and outside of the home environment. We then expand this model to consider the intergenerational contributions and dynamic transactions within families that are important considerations for informing potential avenues for intervention.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Mobile wallet (M-wallet), as an innovative alternative payment, is trendy in developed economies because it provides users with the ease, safety, and fast completion of daily financial activities. However, M-wallets have still been seen in the infancy stage in Vietnam. Therefore, the study aims to discover the main factors shaping behavioral intention to use mobile wallets in Vietnam. The extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with perceived enjoyment and trust was considered as a theoretical foundation for this study. The primary empirical data from 332 respondents were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and enjoyment have positive and significant impacts on behavioral intention to use M-wallets, whereas trust showing no direct effect.",

        "abstract": "Learning from evolution Protein sequences contain information specifying their three-dimensional structure and function, and statistical analysis of families of sequences has been used to predict these properties. Building from sequence data, Russ et al. used statistical models that take into account conservation at amino acid positions and correlations in the evolution of pairs of amino acids to predict new artificial sequences that will have the properties of the protein family. For the chorismate mutase family of metabolic enzymes, the authors demonstrate experimentally that the artificial sequences display natural-like catalytic function. Because the models access an enormous space of diverse sequences, such evolution-based statistical approaches may guide the search for functional proteins with altered chemical activities. Science, this issue p. 440 An evolution-based, data-driven engineering process can build artificial functional enzymes. The rational design of enzymes is an important goal for both fundamental and practical reasons. Here, we describe a process to learn the constraints for specifying proteins purely from evolutionary sequence data, design and build libraries of synthetic genes, and test them for activity in vivo using a quantitative complementation assay. For chorismate mutase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids, we demonstrate the design of natural-like catalytic function with substantial sequence diversity. Further optimization focuses the generative model toward function in a specific genomic context. The data show that sequence-based statistical models suffice to specify proteins and provide access to an enormous space of functional sequences. This result provides a foundation for a general process for evolution-based design of artificial proteins.",

        "abstract": "Anatomical education has been undergoing reforms in line with the demands of medical profession. The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of a traditional method like cadaveric dissection in teaching/learning anatomy at present times when medical schools are inclining towards student‐centered, integrated, clinical application models. The article undertakes a review of literature and analyzes the observations made therein reflecting on the relevance of cadaveric dissection in anatomical education of 21st century. Despite the advent of modern technology and evolved teaching methods, dissection continues to remain a cornerstone of anatomy curriculum. Medical professionals of all levels believe that dissection enables learning anatomy with relevant clinical correlates. Moreover dissection helps to build discipline independent skills which are essential requirements of modern health care setup. It has been supplemented by other teaching/learning methods due to limited availability of cadavers in some countries. However, in the developing world due to good access to cadavers, dissection based teaching is central to anatomy education till date. Its utility is also reflected in the perception of students who are of the opinion that dissection provides them with a foundation critical to development of clinical skills. Researchers have even suggested that time has come to reinstate dissection as the core method of teaching gross anatomy to ensure safe medical practice. Nevertheless, as dissection alone cannot provide uniform learning experience hence needs to be complemented with other innovative learning methods in the future education model of anatomy.

        "abstract": "Dynamic networks are used in a wide range of fields, including social network analysis, recommender systems and epidemiology. Representing complex networks as structures changing over time allow network models to leverage not only structural but also temporal patterns. However, as dynamic network literature stems from diverse fields and makes use of inconsistent terminology, it is challenging to navigate. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained a lot of attention in recent years for their ability to perform well on a range of network science tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. Despite the popularity of graph neural networks and the proven benefits of dynamic network models, there has been little focus on graph neural networks for dynamic networks. To address the challenges resulting from the fact that this research crosses diverse fields as well as to survey dynamic graph neural networks, this work is split into two main parts. First, to address the ambiguity of the dynamic network terminology we establish a foundation of dynamic networks with consistent, detailed terminology and notation. Second, we present a comprehensive survey of dynamic graph neural network models using the proposed terminology.",

In this article, we discuss how a digital twin replication model and corresponding security architecture can be used to allow data sharing and control of security-critical processes. We identify design-driving security requirements for digital twin based data sharing and control. We show that the proposed state synchronization design meets the expected digital twin synchronization requirements and give a high-level design and evaluation of other security components of the architecture. We also make performance evaluations of a proof of concept for protected software upgrade using the proposed digital twin design.

Our foundation is based on a variational extension of Shannon's information theory that takes into account the modeling power and computational constraints of the observer. The resulting \\emph{predictive $\\mathcal{V}$-information} encompasses mutual information and other notions of informativeness such as the coefficient of determination. Unlike Shannon's mutual information and in violation of the data processing inequality, $\\mathcal{V}$-information can be created through computation. This is consistent with deep neural networks extracting hierarchies of progressively more informative features in representation learning. Additionally, we show that by incorporating computational constraints, $\\mathcal{V}$-information can be reliably estimated from data even in high dimensions with PAC-style guarantees. Empirically, we demonstrate predictive $\\mathcal{V}$-information is more effective than mutual information for structure learning and fair representation learning.",

        "abstract": "Information systems (IS) use, the dominant theoretical paradigm for explaining how users apply IS artifacts toward goal attainment, gives primacy to human agency in the user-IS artifact relationship. Models and theorizing in the IS use research stream tend to treat the IS artifact as a passive tool; lacking in the ability to initiate action and accept rights and responsibilities for achieving optimal outcomes under uncertainty. We argue that a new generation of “agentic” IS artifacts requires revisiting the human agency primacy assumption. ​Agentic IS artifacts​ are no longer passive tools waiting to be used, are no longer always subordinate to the human agent, and can now assume responsibility for tasks with ambiguous requirements and for seeking optimal outcomes under uncertainty. To move our theorizing forward, we introduce ​delegation​, based on agent interaction theories, as a foundational and powerful lens through which to understand and explain the human-agentic IS artifact relationship. While delegation has always been central to human-IS artifact interactions, it has yet to be explicitly recognized in IS use theorizing. We explicitly theorize IS delegation by developing an IS delegation theoretical framework. This framework provides a scaffolding which can guide future IS delegation theorizing and focuses on the human-agentic IS artifact ​dyad​ as the elemental unit of analysis. The framework specifically reveals the importance of agent attributes relevant to delegation (endowments, preferences, and roles) as well as foundational mechanisms of delegation (appraisal, distribution, and coordination). Guidelines are proposed to demonstrate how this theoretical framework can be applied toward generation of testable models. We conclude by outlining a roadmap for mobilizin​g​ future research.",

        "abstract": "It seems obvious that the identification of coping structure is necessary to understand how stress affects human health and functioning. Despite numerous coping conceptualization proposals, there is no agreement as to the core coping categories. This article presents the Coping Circumplex Model (CCM), which is designed to integrate various coping distinctions, drawing inspiration from the tradition of circumplex models in psychology. The model is based on the assumption that individuals in stressful situations face two tasks: they need to solve the problem and regulate their emotions, which are reflected in two corresponding dimensions, that is, the problem coping dimension and emotion coping dimension. Problem coping and emotion coping are interpreted as bipolar dimensions. Importantly, these dimensions define a space for other coping categories. The model contains a total of eight coping styles forming a circumplex: positive emotional coping, efficiency, problem solving, preoccupation with the problem, negative emotional coping, helplessness, problem avoidance, and hedonic disengagement. The paper discusses the potential of the CCM to overcome some of the problems of stress psychology by: (a) supplementing the set of coping categories (i.e., process, strategy, style) with coping mode; (b) providing a foundation for the integration of numerous coping constructs; (c) enabling the interpretation of results obtained by means of different coping measures, thus facilitating knowledge consolidation; (d) explaining relationships between coping and adjustment after trauma, as well as explaining the mechanisms of psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive therapy, exposure therapy); (e) clarifying linkages between the effectiveness of coping strategies and situation controllability. Moreover, the CCM may elucidate the relationship between coping and emotion regulation (e.g., cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression).",

With the gating that merges two towers of Transformer which model the channel-wise and step-wise correlations respectively, we show how GTN is naturally and effectively suitable for the multivariate time series classification task. We conduct comprehensive experiments on thirteen dataset with full ablation study. Our results show that GTN is able to achieve competing results with current state-of-the-art deep learning models. We also explored the attention map for the natural interpretability of GTN on time series modeling.

Talbert, a mathematics professor and assistant department chair at Grand Valley State University, wrote this book to share effective practices in flipped learning design that he uncovered through trial, error, and research, both his and others’. Talbert’s aim is to provide an understanding of what is meant by flipped learning and a roadmap to effectively implement this pedagogical approach. This review includes a description of the text, a comparison with similarly focused instructional resources, and an explanation of why this book is an excellent addition to the recommended readings of language instructors and interpretation/translation instructors. Talbert provides a conceptual framework of learning by describing the foundation for the approach, which is based on a collection of well-researched effective teaching/learning practices, not on a hunch about what will work well in a college course. The foundational principles are self-determination theory, cognitive load theory and the framework of self-regulated learning . Talbert also discusses backward design and integrated course design as frameworks that can be used alongside the flipped learning approach. With the explanations and examples in the text, reader can easily grasp how this approach differs from the traditional “assignments and homework” model.

        "title": "Predictive representations can link model-based reinforcement learning to model-free mechanisms",
        "abstract": "Humans and animals are capable of evaluating actions by considering their long-run future rewards through a process described using model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The mechanisms by which neural circuits perform the computations prescribed by model-based RL remain largely unknown; however, multiple lines of evidence suggest that neural circuits supporting model-based behavior are structurally homologous to and overlapping with those thought to carry out model-free temporal difference (TD) learning. Here, we lay out a family of approaches by which model-based computation may be built upon a core of TD learning. The foundation of this framework is the successor representation, a predictive state representation that, when combined with TD learning of value predictions, can produce a subset of the behaviors associated with model-based learning, while requiring less decision-time computation than dynamic programming. Using simulations, we delineate the precise behavioral capabilities enabled by evaluating actions using this approach, and compare them to those demonstrated by biological organisms. We then introduce two new algorithms that build upon the successor representation while progressively mitigating its limitations. Because this framework can account for the full range of observed putatively model-based behaviors while still utilizing a core TD framework, we suggest that it represents a neurally plausible family of mechanisms for model-based evaluation. Author Summary According to standard models, when confronted with a choice, animals and humans rely on two separate, distinct processes to come to a decision. One process deliberatively evaluates the consequences of each candidate action and is thought to underlie the ability to flexibly come up with novel plans. The other process gradually increases the propensity to perform behaviors that were previously successful and is thought to underlie automatically executed, habitual reflexes. Although computational principles and animal behavior support this dichotomy, at the neural level, there is little evidence supporting a clean segregation. For instance, although dopamine — famously implicated in drug addiction and Parkinson’s disease — currently only has a well-defined role in the automatic process, evidence suggests that it also plays a role in the deliberative process. In this work, we present a computational framework for resolving this mismatch. We show that the types of behaviors associated with either process could result from a common learning mechanism applied to different strategies for how populations of neurons could represent candidate actions. In addition to demonstrating that this account can produce the full range of flexible behavior observed in the empirical literature, we suggest experiments that could detect the various approaches within this framework.",

        "abstract": "We describe an end-to-end method for recovering 3D human body mesh from single images and monocular videos. Different from the existing methods try to obtain all the complex 3D pose, shape, and camera parameters from one coupling feature, we propose a skeleton-disentangling based framework, which divides this task into multi-level spatial and temporal granularity in a decoupling manner. In spatial, we propose an effective and pluggable “disentangling the skeleton from the details” (DSD) module. It reduces the complexity and decouples the skeleton, which lays a good foundation for temporal modeling. In temporal, the self-attention based temporal convolution network is proposed to efficiently exploit the short and long-term temporal cues. Furthermore, an unsupervised adversarial training strategy, temporal shuffles and order recovery, is designed to promote the learning of motion dynamics. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art 3D human mesh recovery methods by 15.4% MPJPE and 23.8% PA-MPJPE on Human3.6M. State-of-the-art results are also achieved on the 3D pose in the wild (3DPW) dataset without any fine-tuning. Especially, ablation studies demonstrate that skeleton-disentangled representation is crucial for better temporal modeling and generalization.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT News avoidance is considered an increasing problem for the news industry and democracy at large. As news companies lose consumers, democracy loses the informed foundation for an engaged citizenry. Meanwhile, research on news avoidance is hampered by the lack of a common understanding of the phenomenon. In this conceptual study, we first review and discuss extant conceptualizations and operationalisations of news avoidance. Second, we present a model distinguishing two types of news avoidance—intentional and unintentional—depending on the underlying causes leading people to tune out. Third, we argue that different solutions apply to the two types of news avoidance. To engage intentional news avoiders, the news selection and news presentation must to be changed. To engage unintentional news avoiders, the opportunity structures provided in the media system must be more favourable towards inadvertent news exposure.",

This paper argues that the simple cause-effect relationship modelling approach in some cases may lead to misleading and false conclusions. As a basis of theoretical foundation to justify our approach, we introduce a system’s view of e-learning success model.

Protection motivation theory was taken as the theoretical foundation of this study, and ‘perceived government support’ was integrated as a new construct into the research model. Using data collected from international tourists visiting Beijing, China, structural equation modelling was employed to identify significant variables that could predict and explain international tourists’ protective behavioural intentions. Results reveal that severity, vulnerability, response efficacy, and self-efficacy significantly and positively influenced protective behavioural intention, whereas perceived government support exerted a significant and negative effect. Among significant and positive variables, the influence of the severity of threat appraisal was largest. Based on these findings, theoretical and practical implications related to protection motivation theory are discussed in a tourism context.",

It is necessary to establish a battery model for the implementation of BMS's effective control. With more comprehensive and faster battery model, it would be accurate and effective to reflect the behavior of the battery level to the vehicle. On this basis, to ensure battery safety, power, and durability, some key technologies based on the model are advanced, such as battery state estimation, energy equalization, thermal management, and fault diagnosis. Besides, the communication of interactions between BMS and vehicle controllers, motor controllers, etc is an essential consideration for optimizing driving and improving vehicle performance. As concluded, a synergistic and collaborative BMS is the foundation for green‐energy vehicles to be intelligent, electric, networked, and shared. Thus, this paper reviews the research and development (R&D) of multiphysics model simulation and multifunction integrated BMS technology. In addition, summary of the relevant research and state‐of‐the‐art technology is dedicated to improving the synergy and coordination of BMS and to promote the innovation and optimization of new energy vehicle technology.",

Objective To measure the proportion of individuals with a first episode of psychosis detected by ARMS services in secondary mental health services, and to develop and externally validate a practical web-based individualized risk calculator tool for the transdiagnostic prediction of psychosis in secondary mental health care. Design, Setting, and Participants Clinical register-based cohort study. Patients were drawn from electronic, real-world, real-time clinical records relating to 2008 to 2015 routine secondary mental health care in the South London and the Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust. The study included all patients receiving a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within the South London and the Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust in the period between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2015. Data analysis began on September 1, 2016. Main Outcomes and Measures Risk of development of nonorganic International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision psychotic disorders. Results A total of 91 199 patients receiving a first index diagnosis of nonorganic and nonpsychotic mental disorder within South London and the Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust were included in the derivation (n = 33 820) or external validation (n = 54 716) data sets. The mean age was 32.97 years, 50.88% were men, and 61.05% were white race/ethnicity. The mean follow-up was 1588 days. The overall 6-year risk of psychosis in secondary mental health care was 3.02 (95% CI, 2.88-3.15), which is higher than the 6-year risk in the local general population (0.62). Compared with the ARMS designation, all of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision diagnoses showed a lower risk of psychosis, with the exception of bipolar mood disorders (similar risk) and brief psychotic episodes (higher risk). The ARMS designation accounted only for a small proportion of transitions to psychosis (n = 52 of 1001; 5.19% in the derivation data set), indicating the need for transdiagnostic prediction of psychosis in secondary mental health care. A prognostic risk stratification model based on preselected variables, including index diagnosis, age, sex, age by sex, and race/ethnicity, was developed and externally validated, showing good performance and potential clinical usefulness. Conclusions and Relevance This online individualized risk calculator can be of clinical usefulness for the transdiagnostic prediction of psychosis in secondary mental health care. The risk calculator can help to identify those patients at risk of developing psychosis who require an ARMS assessment and specialized care. The use of this calculator may eventually facilitate the implementation of an individualized provision of preventive focused interventions and improve outcomes of first episode psychosis.",

Gabrio Piola dedicated his scientific life to formulating a continuum theory in order to encompass a large class of deformation phenomena and was the first author to consider continua with non-local internal interactions and, as a particular case, higher-gradient continua. More recent followers of Piola (Mindlin, Sedov and then Richard Toupin) recognized the principle of virtual work (and its particular case, the principle of least action) as the (only!) firm foundation of continuum mechanics. Mindlin and Toupin managed to formulate a conceptual frame for continuum mechanics which is able to effectively model the complex behaviour of so-called architectured, advanced, multiscale or microstructured (meta)materials. Other postulation schemes, in contrast, do not seem able to be equally efficient. The present work aims to provide a historical and theoretical overview of the subject.

        "abstract": "Building information modelling (BIM) is the first step towards the implementation of the industrial revolution 4.0, in which virtual reality and digital twins are key elements. At present, buildings are responsible for 40% of the energy consumption in Europe and, so, there is a growing interest in reducing their energy use. In this context, proper interoperability between BIM and building energy model (BEM) is paramount for integrating the digital world into the construction sector and, therefore, increasing competitiveness by saving costs. This paper evaluates whether there is an automated or semi-automated BIM to BEM workflow that could improve the building design process. For this purpose, a residential building and a warehouse are constructed using the same BIM authoring tool (Revit), where two open schemas were used: green building extensible markup language (gbXML) and industry foundation classes (IFC). These transfer files were imported into software compatible with the EnergyPlus engine—Design Builder, Open Studio, and CYPETHERM HE—in which simulations were performed. Our results showed that the energy models were built up to 7.50% smaller than in the BIM and with missing elements in their thermal envelope. Nevertheless, the materials were properly transferred to gbXML and IFC formats. Moreover, the simulation results revealed a huge difference in values between the models generated by the open schemas, in the range of 6 to 900 times. Overall, we conclude that there exists a semi-automated workflow from BIM to BEM which does not work well for big and complex buildings, as they present major problems when creating the energy model. Furthermore, most of the issues encountered in BEM were errors in the transfer of BIM data to gbXML and IFC files. Therefore, we emphasise the need to improve compatibility between BIM and model exchange formats by their developers, in order to promote BIM–BEM interoperability.",

The article begins with a critical review of prior proposals, proceeds to the analysis of factors enabling the development of a meaningful nucleation flux, and then introduces new ideas that lead to the fulfillment of these requirements. In the new proposal, a rotationally-activated dimer is formed in the collision of an aromatic molecule and an aromatic radical; the two react during the lifetime of the dimer to form a stable, doubly-bonded bridge between them, with the reaction rooted in a five-member ring present on the molecule edge. Several such reactions were examined theoretically and the most promising one generated a measurable nucleation flux. The consistency of the proposed model with known aspects of soot particle nanostructure is discussed. The foundation of the new model is fundamentally the H-Abstraction-Carbon-Addition (HACA) mechanism with the reaction affinity enhanced by rotational excitation.",

        "abstract": "Purpose - The paper develops a model of employee innovative behavior conceptualizing it as distinct from innovation outputs and as a multi-faceted behavior rather than a simple count of ‘innovative acts’ by employees. It understands individual employee innovative behaviors as a micro-foundation of firm intrapreneurship that is embedded in and influenced by contextual factors such as managerial, organizational and cultural support for innovation. Building from a review of existing employee innovative behavior scales and theoretical considerations we develop and validate the Innovative Behavior Inventory (IBI) and the Innovation Support Inventory (ISI). Design/methodology/approach – Two pilot studies, a third validation study in the Czech Republic and a fourth cross-cultural validation study using population representative samples from Switzerland, Germany, Italy and the Czech Republic (n=2,812 employees and 450 entrepreneurs) were conducted. Findings - Both inventories were reliable and showed factorial, criterion, convergent and discriminant validity as well as cross-cultural equivalence. Employee innovative behavior was supported as comprising of idea generation, idea search, idea communication, implementation starting activities, involving others and overcoming obstacles. Managerial support was the most proximal contextual influence on innovative behavior and mediated the effect of organizational support and national culture. Originality/value - The paper advances our understanding of employee innovative behavior as a multi-faceted phenomenon and the contextual factors influencing it. Where past research typically focuses on convenience samples within a particular country, we offer first robust evidence that our model of employee innovative behavior generalizes across cultures and types of samples. Our model and the IBI and ISI inventories enable researchers to build a deeper understanding of the important micro-foundation underpinning intrapreneurial behavior in organizations and allow practitioners to identify their organizations’ strengths and weaknesses related to intrapreneurship.",

        "abstract": "Plant disease is one of the primary causes of crop yield reduction. With the development of computer vision and deep learning technology, autonomous detection of plant surface lesion images collected by optical sensors has become an important research direction for timely crop disease diagnosis. In this paper, an anthracnose lesion detection method based on deep learning is proposed. Firstly, for the problem of insufficient image data caused by the random occurrence of apple diseases, in addition to traditional image augmentation techniques, Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) deep learning model is used in this paper to accomplish data augmentation. These methods effectively enrich the diversity of training data and provide a solid foundation for training the detection model. In this paper, on the basis of image data augmentation, densely connected neural network (DenseNet) is utilized to optimize feature layers of the YOLO-V3 model which have lower resolution. DenseNet greatly improves the utilization of features in the neural network and enhances the detection result of the YOLO-V3 model. It is verified in experiments that the improved model exceeds Faster R-CNN with VGG16 NET, the original YOLO-V3 model, and other three state-of-the-art networks in detection performance, and it can realize real-time detection. The proposed method can be well applied to the detection of anthracnose lesions on apple surfaces in orchards.",

GPLs are uniformly and nonuniformly distributed thorough the thickness direction. Different porosity distributions called uniform, symmetric, and asymmetric are considered. The elastic properties of the nanocomposite are obtained by employing Halpin–Tsai micromechanics model. The GPL-reinforced shell is modeled via first order shear deformation theory and Galerkin's method is implemented to obtain vibration frequencies. New results show the importance of porosity coefficient, porosity distribution, GPL distribution, GPL weight fraction, and geometrical and foundation parameters on vibration behavior of porous nanocomposite shells.",

This has spurred the development of data integration methods that simultaneously harness information from multiple datasets while dealing with the specific strengths and weaknesses of each dataset. We outline the general principles that have guided data integration methods and review recent developments in the field. We then outline key areas that allow for a more general framework for integrating data and provide suggestions for improving sampling design and validation for integrated models. Key to recent advances has been using point‐process thinking to combine estimators developed for different data types. Extending this framework to new data types will further improve our inferences, as well as relaxing assumptions about how parameters are jointly estimated. These along with the better use of information regarding sampling effort and spatial autocorrelation will further improve our inferences. Recent developments form a strong foundation for implementation of data integration models. Wider adoption can improve our inferences about species distributions and the dynamic processes that lead to distributional shifts.",

In order to increase student engagement and identify those students who are most disengaged from school, we need to conceptualize and measure student engagement appropriately. This study used a mixed method sequential exploratory design to develop and validate a student survey measure of school engagement that reflects a multidimensional conceptualization of engagement. Psychometric tests were conducted with a large racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of 5th–12th graders in the United States ( N = 3,632). Findings demonstrated that a bifactor multidimensional model fit the data appropriately and provided evidence of measurement invariance, construct, and predictive validity.

Touch receipt promotes well-being in infancy, but the impacts of touch in adult close relationships have been largely unexplored. In this article, we propose that affectionate touch receipt promotes relational, psychological, and physical well-being in adulthood, and we present a theoretical mechanistic model to explain why affectionate touch may promote these outcomes. The model includes pathways through which touch could affect well-being by reducing stress and by promoting well-being independent of stress. Specifically, two immediate outcomes of affectionate touch receipt—relational-cognitive changes and neurobiological changes—are described as important mechanisms underlying the effects of affectionate touch on well-being. We also review and evaluate the existing research linking affectionate touch to well-being in adulthood and propose an agenda to advance research in this area. This theoretical perspective provides a foundation for future work on touch in adult close relationships.",

Different from traditional studies on cooperative output regulation, a distributed adaptive internal model is originally developed, which includes a distributed internal model and a distributed observer to estimate the leader’s dynamics. Without relying on the dynamics of multiagent systems, we have proposed two reinforcement learning algorithms, policy iteration and value iteration, to learn the optimal controller through online input and state data, and estimated values of the leader’s state. By combining these methods, we have established a basis for connecting data-distributed control methods with adaptive dynamic programming approaches in general since these are the theoretical foundation from which they are built.",

        "abstract": "Composite endpoints that not only encompass mortality and relapse, but other critical post-transplant events such as graft-versus-host disease, are being increasingly utilized to quantify survival without significant morbidity after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation. High-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide reduces severe graft-versus-host disease with allogeneic marrow transplantation, making composite endpoints after this management particularly interesting. We retrospectively analyzed 684 adults with hematologic malignancies who received T-cell-replete bone marrow grafts and cyclophosphamide after myeloablative HLA-matched related (n=192) or unrelated (n=120), or non-myeloablative HLA-haploidentical (n=372) donor transplantation. The median follow up was 4 (range, 0.02–11.4) years. Graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival was defined as the time after transplantation without grade III–IV acute graft-versus-host disease, chronic graft-versus-host disease requiring systemic treatment, relapse, or death. Chronic graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival was defined as the time after transplantation without moderate or severe chronic graft-versus-host disease, relapse, or death. One-year graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival and chronic graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival estimates were, respectively, 47% (95% CI: 41–55%) and 53% (95% CI: 46–61%) after myeloablative HLA-matched related, 42% (95% CI: 34–52%) and 52% (95% CI: 44–62%) after myeloablative HLA-matched unrelated, and 45% (95% CI: 40–50%) and 50% (95% CI: 45–55%) after non-myeloablative HLA-haploidentical donor transplantation. In multivariable models, there were no differences in graft-versus-host disease-free, or chronic graft-versus-host disease-free, relapse-free survival after either myeloablative HLA-matched unrelated or non-myeloablative HLA-haploidentical, compared with myeloablative HLA-matched related donor transplantation. Although limited by inclusion of dissimilar cohorts, we found that post-transplantation cyclophosphamide-based platforms yield comparable composite endpoints across conditioning intensity, donor type, and HLA match.",

While there is increasing knowledge with respect to individual factors promoting the initiation and maintenance of substance use disorders (SUDs), disease trajectories involved in losing and regaining control over drug intake (ReCoDe) are still not well described. Our newly formed German Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) on ReCoDe has an interdisciplinary approach funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) with a 12‐year perspective. The main goals of our research consortium are (i) to identify triggers and modifying factors that longitudinally modulate the trajectories of losing and regaining control over drug consumption in real life, (ii) to study underlying behavioral, cognitive, and neurobiological mechanisms, and (iii) to implicate mechanism‐based interventions. These goals will be achieved by: (i) using mobile health (m‐health) tools to longitudinally monitor the effects of triggers (drug cues, stressors, and priming doses) and modify factors (eg, age, gender, physical activity, and cognitive control) on drug consumption patterns in real‐life conditions and in animal models of addiction; (ii) the identification and computational modeling of key mechanisms mediating the effects of such triggers and modifying factors on goal‐directed, habitual, and compulsive aspects of behavior from human studies and animal models; and (iii) developing and testing interventions that specifically target the underlying mechanisms for regaining control over drug intake.",

        "abstract": "Modern advances in cloud computing and machine-leaning algorithms are shifting the manner in which Earth-observation (EO) data are used for environmental monitoring, particularly as we settle into the era of free, open-access satellite data streams. Wetland delineation represents a particularly worthy application of this emerging research trend, since wetlands are an ecologically important yet chronically under-represented component of contemporary mapping and monitoring programs, particularly at the regional and national levels. Exploiting Google Earth Engine and R Statistical software, we developed a workflow for predicting the probability of wetland occurrence using a boosted regression tree machine-learning framework applied to digital topographic and EO data. Working in a 13,700 km2 study area in northern Alberta, our best models produced excellent results, with AUC (area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve) values of 0.898 and explained-deviance values of 0.708. Our results demonstrate the central role of high-quality topographic variables for modeling wetland distribution at regional scales. Including optical and/or radar variables into the workflow substantially improved model performance, though optical data performed slightly better. Converting our wetland probability-of-occurrence model into a binary Wet-Dry classification yielded an overall accuracy of 85%, which is virtually identical to that derived from the Alberta Merged Wetland Inventory (AMWI): the contemporary inventory used by the Government of Alberta. However, our workflow contains several key advantages over that used to produce the AMWI, and provides a scalable foundation for province-wide monitoring initiatives.",

        "abstract": "This paper develops a real-time algorithmic framework for aggregations of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution networks to provide regulation services in response to transmission-level requests. Leveraging online primal-dual-type methods for time-varying optimization problems and suitable linearizations of the nonlinear AC power-flow equations, this work establishes a system-theoretic foundation to realize the vision of distribution-level virtual power plants. The optimization framework controls the output powers of dispatchable DERs such that, in aggregate, they respond to automatic generation control and/or regulation-services commands. This is achieved while concurrently regulating voltages within the feeder and maximizing customers’ and utility's performance objectives. Convergence and tracking capabilities are analytically established under suitable modeling assumptions. Simulations are provided to validate the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "This document is designed to be a first-year graduate-level introduction to probabilistic programming. It not only provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic machine learning and programming languages. \nWe start with a discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why conditioning as a foundational computation is central to the fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence. We then introduce a simple first-order probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs define static-computation-graph, finite-variable-cardinality models. In the context of this restricted PPL we introduce fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can be implemented in the context of models denoted by probabilistic programs. \nIn the second part of this document, we introduce a higher-order probabilistic programming language, with a functionality analogous to that of established programming languages. This affords the opportunity to define models with dynamic computation graphs, at the cost of requiring inference methods that generate samples by repeatedly executing the program. Foundational inference algorithms for this kind of probabilistic programming language are explained in the context of an interface between program executions and an inference controller. \nThis document closes with a chapter on advanced topics which we believe to be, at the time of writing, interesting directions for probabilistic programming research; directions that point towards a tight integration with deep neural network research and the development of systems for next-generation artificial intelligence applications.",

        "abstract": "State-space models (SSMs) are an important modeling framework for analyzing ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model population dynamics, animal movement, and capture-recapture data, and are now increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate between biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly modeled. Since the introduction of SSMs, a broad range of fitting procedures have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can limit the ability of ecologists to formulate and fit their own SSMs. We provide the knowledge for ecologists to create SSMs that are robust to common, and often hidden, estimation problems, and the model selection and validation tools that can help them assess how well their models fit their data. In this paper, we present a review of SSMs that will provide a strong foundation to ecologists interested in learning about SSMs, introduce new tools to veteran SSM users, and highlight promising research directions for statisticians interested in ecological applications. The review is accompanied by an in-depth tutorial that demonstrates how SSMs models can be fitted and validated in R. Together, the review and tutorial present an introduction to SSMs that will help ecologists to formulate, fit, and validate their models.",

This theory includes indeterminate integral variables and contains only four unknowns in which any shear correction factor not used, with even less than the conventional theory of first shear strain (FSDT). Applying the principle of virtual displacements, the governing equations and boundary conditions are obtained. To solve the buckling problem for different boundary conditions, Galerkin\\'s approach is utilized for symmetric EGM sandwich plates with six different boundary conditions. A detailed numerical study is carried out to examine the influence of plate aspect ratio, elastic foundation coefficients, ratio, side-to-thickness ratio and boundary conditions on the buckling response of FGM sandwich plates. A good agreement between the results obtained and the available solutions of existing shear deformation theories that have a greater number of unknowns proves to demonstrate the precision of the proposed theory.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Rationale, aims, and objectives “Implementation science,” the scientific study of methods translating research findings into practical, useful outcomes, is contested and complex, with unpredictable use of results from routine clinical practice and different levels of continuing assessment of implementable interventions. The authors aim to reveal how implementation science is presented and understood in health services research contexts and clarify the foundational concepts: diffusion, dissemination, implementation, adoption, and sustainability, to progress knowledge in the field. Method Implementation science models, theories, and frameworks are critiqued, and their value for laying the groundwork from which to implement a study's findings is emphasised. The paper highlights the challenges of turning research findings into practical outcomes that can be successfully implemented and the need for support from change agents, to ensure improvements to health care provision, health systems, and policy. The paper examines how researchers create implementation plans and what needs to be considered for study outputs to lead to sustainable interventions. This aspect needs clear planning, underpinned by appropriate theoretical paradigms that rigorously respond to a study's aims and objectives. Conclusion Researchers might benefit from a return to first principles in implementation science, whereby applications that result from research endeavours are both effective and readily disseminated and where interventions can be supported by appropriate health care personnel. These should be people specifically identified to promote change in service organisation, delivery, and policy that can be systematically evaluated over time, to ensure high‐quality, long‐term improvements to patients' health.",

        "abstract": "Task-based modeling with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) has emerged as a popular way to infer the computational function of different brain regions. These models are quantitatively assessed by comparing the low-dimensional neural representations of the model with the brain, for example using canonical correlation analysis (CCA). However, the nature of the detailed neurobiological inferences one can draw from such efforts remains elusive. For example, to what extent does training neural networks to solve common tasks uniquely determine the network dynamics, independent of modeling architectural choices? Or alternatively, are the learned dynamics highly sensitive to different model choices? Knowing the answer to these questions has strong implications for whether and how we should use task-based RNN modeling to understand brain dynamics. To address these foundational questions, we study populations of thousands of networks, with commonly used RNN architectures, trained to solve neuroscientifically motivated tasks and characterize their nonlinear dynamics. We find the geometry of the RNN representations can be highly sensitive to different network architectures, yielding a cautionary tale for measures of similarity that rely on representational geometry, such as CCA. Moreover, we find that while the geometry of neural dynamics can vary greatly across architectures, the underlying computational scaffold-the topological structure of fixed points, transitions between them, limit cycles, and linearized dynamics-often appears universal across all architectures.",

Undoubtedly, the data collected by underlying sensor networks are the foundation of both the IoT systems and IoT applications. However, due to the weakness and vulnerability to attacks of underlying sensor networks, the data collected are usually untrustworthy, which may cause disastrous consequences. In this article, a new model is proposed to collect trustworthy data on the basis of edge computing in the IoT. In this model, the sensor nodes are evaluated from multiple dimensions to obtain accurately quantified trust values. Besides, by mapping the trust value of a node onto a force for the mobile data collector, the best mobility path is generated with high trust. Moreover, a mobile edge data collector is used to visit both the sensors with quantified trust values and collect trustworthy data. The extensive experiment validates that the IoT systems based on trustworthy data collection model gain a significant improvement in their performance, in terms of both system security and energy conservation.",

Therefore, little is known about factors propelling user’s intention to adopt internet banking in Pakistan. Thus, the purpose of this research is to investigate the role of unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) in internet banking adoption context. A quantitative approach based survey was conducted to collect the data from 398 internet banking users. For statistical analysis structural equation model (SEM) approach was used. The result of this study indicates that, UTAUT model provided a good theoretical foundation in technology adoption investigation. Findings confirmed that all four predictors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating condition) were significant and had significant amount of variance in predicting user’s intention to adopt internet banking. Additionally, the IPMA test revealed that performance expectancy was the most important factor among all other variables to predict user’s intention towards adoption of internet banking. Lastly, managerial implications, limitations and future recommendations are discussed. © 2018 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada",

We show several candidate policy update rules and relate them to a foundation of regret minimization and multiagent learning techniques for the one-shot and tabular cases, leading to previously unknown convergence guarantees. We apply our method to model-free multiagent reinforcement learning in adversarial sequential decision problems (zero-sum imperfect information games), using RL-style function approximation. We evaluate on commonly used benchmark Poker domains, showing performance against fixed policies and empirical convergence to approximate Nash equilibria in self-play with rates similar to or better than a baseline model-free algorithm for zero-sum games, without any domain-specific state space reductions.",

Furthermore, this theory takes into account the stretching effect due to its quasi-three-dimensional nature. The boundary conditions in the top and bottoms surfaces of the sandwich functionally graded plate are satisfied and no correction factor is required. Various types of functionally graded material sandwich plates are considered. The governing equations and boundary conditions are derived using the principle of virtual displacements. Numerical examples, selected from the literature, are illustrated. A good agreement is obtained between numerical results of the refined theory and the reference solutions.

Based on nine multinational organisations and four cases of leading companies engaged with CE activity, we address the types of indicators being used and make recommendations for indicators to reflect key goals and principles of CE. Our research on the development and expansion of circular practices leads to the question of what new opportunities and challenges CE raises for such companies in terms of competitive business advantage and resultant requirements for supply chain redesign and indicator development, over and above pre-existing closed-loop production.",

First, the concept of semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability that has been widely used for smooth nonlinear systems with lower triangular systems is extended to the nonsmooth systems. Then by resorting to set-valued maps and set-valued derivatives, a new Lyapunov criterion ensuring the SGUUB stability is developed for nonsmooth nonlinear systems, which establishes the theory foundation for the subsequent backstepping control design. With the help of Cellina approximate selection theorem and smooth approximation theorem for Lipschitz functions, the system under investigation is first transformed into an equivalent model. In the sequel, exploring some efficient techniques, an adaptive fuzzy output-feedback controller is constructed for the systems under consideration by utilizing an appropriate observer and the approximation ability of fuzzy systems. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.",

Because rivers and streams constantly exchange O2 with the atmosphere, models must either use empirical estimates of the gas exchange rate coefficient (K600) or solve for all three parameters (GPP, ER, and K600) simultaneously. Empirical measurements of K600 require substantial field work and can still be inaccurate. Three‐parameter models have suffered from equifinality, where good fits to O2 data are achieved by many different parameter values, some unrealistic. We developed a new three‐parameter, multiday model that ensures similar values for K600 among days with similar physical conditions (e.g., discharge). Our new model overcomes the equifinality problem by (1) flexibly relating K600 to discharge while permitting moderate daily deviations and (2) avoiding the oft‐violated assumption that residuals in O2 predictions are uncorrelated. We implemented this hierarchical state‐space model and several competitor models in an open‐source R package, streamMetabolizer. We then tested the models against both simulated and field data. Our new model reduces error by as much as 70% in daily estimates of K600, GPP, and ER. Further, accuracy benefits of multiday data sets require as few as 3 days of data. This approach facilitates more accurate metabolism estimates for more streams and days, enabling researchers to better quantify carbon fluxes, compare streams by their metabolic regimes, and investigate controls on aquatic activity.",

First, the concept of semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) stability that has been widely used for smooth nonlinear systems with lower triangular systems is extended to the nonsmooth systems. Then by resorting to set-valued maps and set-valued derivatives, a new Lyapunov criterion ensuring the SGUUB stability is developed for nonsmooth nonlinear systems, which establishes the theory foundation for the subsequent backstepping control design. With the help of Cellina approximate selection theorem and smooth approximation theorem for Lipschitz functions, the system under investigation is first transformed into an equivalent model. In the sequel, exploring some efficient techniques, an adaptive fuzzy output-feedback controller is constructed for the systems under consideration by utilizing an appropriate observer and the approximation ability of fuzzy systems. Finally, a numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed control method.",

To do this we utilise the Ellen MacArthur Foundation butterfly model as a coherent systems overview of key material stocks and flows, and representation of relationships between inputs, outputs, recovery processes, emissions, energy and value loops in physical and financial measures which constitute the CE supply chain. Based on nine multinational organisations and four cases of leading companies engaged with CE activity, we address the types of indicators being used and make recommendations for indicators to reflect key goals and principles of CE. Our research on the development and expansion of circular practices leads to the question of what new opportunities and challenges CE raises for such companies in terms of competitive business advantage and resultant requirements for supply chain redesign and indicator development, over and above pre-existing closed-loop production.",

        "abstract": "Empirical scoring functions based on either molecular force fields or cheminformatics descriptors are widely used, in conjunction with molecular docking, during the early stages of drug discovery to predict potency and binding affinity of a drug-like molecule to a given target. These models require expert-level knowledge of physical chemistry and biology to be encoded as hand-tuned parameters or features rather than allowing the underlying model to select features in a data-driven procedure. Here, we develop a general 3-dimensional spatial convolution operation for learning atomic-level chemical interactions directly from atomic coordinates and demonstrate its application to structure-based bioactivity prediction. The atomic convolutional neural network is trained to predict the experimentally determined binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex by direct calculation of the energy associated with the complex, protein, and ligand given the crystal structure of the binding pose. Non-covalent interactions present in the complex that are absent in the protein-ligand sub-structures are identified and the model learns the interaction strength associated with these features. We test our model by predicting the binding free energy of a subset of protein-ligand complexes found in the PDBBind dataset and compare with state-of-the-art cheminformatics and machine learning-based approaches. We find that all methods achieve experimental accuracy and that atomic convolutional networks either outperform or perform competitively with the cheminformatics based methods. Unlike all previous protein-ligand prediction systems, atomic convolutional networks are end-to-end and fully-differentiable. They represent a new data-driven, physics-based deep learning model paradigm that offers a strong foundation for future improvements in structure-based bioactivity prediction.",

It has provided the foundation for state-of-the-art methods in representation learning and generative modelling, with the number of use-cases continuing to proliferate. However, it suffers from a critical limitation: it fails to accurately estimate ratios p/q for which the two densities differ significantly. Empirically, we find this occurs whenever the KL divergence between p and q exceeds tens of nats. To resolve this limitation, we introduce a new framework, telescoping density-ratio estimation (TRE), that enables the estimation of ratios between highly dissimilar densities in high-dimensional spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that TRE can yield substantial improvements over existing single-ratio methods for mutual information estimation, representation learning and energy-based modelling.",

As one of the main ways of People's Daily communication, image is widely used as a carrier of communication because of its rich content, intuitive and other advantages. Image recognition based on convolution neural network is the first application in the field of image recognition. A series of algorithm operations such as image eigenvalue extraction, recognition and convolution are used to identify and analyze different images. The rapid development of artificial intelligence makes machine learning more and more important in its research field. Use algorithms to learn each piece of data and predict the outcome. This has become an important key to open the door of artificial intelligence. In machine vision, image recognition is the foundation, but how to associate the low-level information in the image with the high-level image semantics becomes the key problem of image recognition. Predecessors have provided many model algorithms, which have laid a solid foundation for the development of artificial intelligence and image recognition. The multi-level information fusion model based on the VGG16 model is an improvement on the fully connected neural network. Different from full connection network, convolutional neural network does not use full connection method in each layer of neurons of neural network, but USES some nodes for connection. Although this method reduces the computation time, due to the fact that the convolutional neural network model will lose some useful feature information in the process of propagation and calculation, this paper improves the model to be a multi-level information fusion of the convolution calculation method, and further recovers the discarded feature information, so as to improve the recognition rate of the image. VGG divides the network into five groups (mimicking the five layers of AlexNet), yet it USES 3∗3 filters and combines them as a convolution sequence. Network deeper DCNN, channel number is bigger. The recognition rate of the model was verified by 0RL Face Database, BioID Face Database and CASIA Face Image Database.",

The variation of Ni2+/Ni3+ and Co2+/Co3+ as the NMC composition changes alters the structural stability, electrical conductivity, lattice parameters, elastic modulus, and thermal stability. The theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental results. Through intensive computational screening, we further show that long-range atomic ordering is absent in the NMC lattice due to the mixture of the ionic states and similar ionic radii of the TM elements. The first-principles modeling provides a theoretical foundation on a complete understanding of the physicochemical properties of NMC at the level of electronic structures.",

We build on this foundation to offer new propositions on how various person and situational factors combine at each phase to produce different emotional and behavioral pathways, and we further conceptualize how feedback loops linking the behavioral responses in one episode to the next can result in emotional modulations and increasing (or decreasing) trajectories of adaptation to abuse.

However, a limited genetic counseling workforce at a time in which there is a rapidly growing need for services is challenging the balance of supply and demand. This article provides historical context to better understand what has informed traditional models of genetic counseling and considers some of the current forces that require genetic counselors to adapt their practice. New service delivery models can improve access to genetic healthcare by overcoming geographical barriers, allowing genetic counselors to see a higher volume of patients and supporting other healthcare providers to better provide genetic services to meet the needs of their patients.

In addition, viscoelastic foundation covers the composite nanostructure. Therefore, the impacts of the small scale parameter are studied while nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT) is considered. The present research deals for the first time with the consideration of viscoelastic, strain–stress size-dependent parameters along with taking into account of various boundary conditions (BCs), especially C-F ones put into effect on the proposed theory. The governing equations (G.Eqs) and BCs have been obtained utilizing energy method and solved with assistance of the generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM). Besides, for the validation of the results, the results of the current model are compared to the results acquired from analytical method. The results show that, viscoelastic foundation, patterns of GPL distribution, nonlocal parameter, length scale parameter, layers’ numbers, boundary condition as well as GPL weight function have considerable impact on the stability of the GPLRC cylindrical microshell. Another significant result is that; for C-F B.Cs, at the higher value of the parameter, the influence of the on the dimensionless buckling load of the structure is much more remarkable in comparison with the lower one which in results section is investigated in detail. The results of the present investigation would be informative for design and fabrication of the microactuators and microsensors.",

        "abstract": "Finding an embedding space for a linear approximation of a nonlinear dynamical system enables efficient system identification and control synthesis. The Koopman operator theory lays the foundation for identifying the nonlinear-to-linear coordinate transformations with data-driven methods. Recently, researchers have proposed to use deep neural networks as a more expressive class of basis functions for calculating the Koopman operators. These approaches, however, assume a fixed dimensional state space; they are therefore not applicable to scenarios with a variable number of objects. In this paper, we propose to learn compositional Koopman operators, using graph neural networks to encode the state into object-centric embeddings and using a block-wise linear transition matrix to regularize the shared structure across objects. The learned dynamics can quickly adapt to new environments of unknown physical parameters and produce control signals to achieve a specified goal. Our experiments on manipulating ropes and controlling soft robots show that the proposed method has better efficiency and generalization ability than existing baselines.",

The committee comprised 3 workgroups: Cancer Risk, Transplant, and Procedure and Preparation. A guidelines specialist at the CF Foundation conducted an evidence synthesis February-March 2016 based on PubMed literature searches. Task force members conducted additional independent searches. A total of 1159 articles were retrieved. After initial screening, the committee read 198 articles in full and analyzed 123 articles to develop recommendation statements. An independent decision analysis evaluating the benefits of screening relative to harms and resources required was conducted by the Department of Public Health at Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands using the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model from the Cancer Innervation and Surveillance Modeling Network. The task force included recommendation statements in the final guideline only if they reached an 80% acceptance threshold.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe task force makes 10 CRC screening recommendations that emphasize shared, individualized decision-making and familiarity with CF-specific gastrointestinal challenges. We recommend colonoscopy as the preferred screening method, initiation of screening at age 40 years, 5-year re-screening and 3-year surveillance intervals (unless shorter interval is indicated by individual findings), and a CF-specific intensive bowel preparation. Organ transplant recipients with CF should initiate CRC screening at age 30 years within 2 years of the transplantation because of the additional risk for colon cancer associated with immunosuppression.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese recommendations aim to help CF adults, families, primary care physicians, gastroenterologists, and CF and transplantation centers address the issue of CRC screening. They differ from guidelines developed for the general population with respect to the recommended age of screening initiation, screening method, preparation, and the interval for repeat screening and surveillance.",

Depending on the animal selected the energetic demands and flux through the oxygen transport system can increase two orders of magnitude from rest to maximal exercise. Thus, animal models in health and disease present the scientist with flexible and powerful, and in some instances, purpose-built tools to explore the mechanistic bases for physiologic function and help unveil the causes for pathological or age-related exercise intolerance. Elegant experimental designs and analyses of kinetic parameters and steady-state responses permit acute and chronic exercise paradigms to identify therapeutic targets for drug development in disease and also present the opportunity to test the efficacy of pharmacological and behavioral countermeasures during aging, for example. However, for this promise to be fully realized, the correct or optimal animal model must be selected in conjunction with reproducible tests of physiological function (e.g., exercise capacity, maximal oxygen uptake) that can be compared equitably across laboratories, clinics and other proving grounds. Rigorously controlled animal exercise and training studies constitute the foundation of translational research. This review presents the most commonly selected animal models with guidelines for their use and obtaining reproducible results and, crucially, translates state-of-the-art techniques and procedures developed on humans to those animal models.",

        "abstract": "Expansion and collapse are two key features of a financial asset bubble. Bubble expansion may be modeled using a mildly explosive process. Bubble implosion may take several different forms depending on the nature of the collapse and therefore requires some flexibility in modeling. This paper first strengthens the theoretical foundation of the real time bubble monitoring strategy proposed in Phillips, Shi and Yu (2015a,b, PSY) by developing analytics and studying the performance characteristics of the testing algorithm under alternative forms of bubble implosion which capture various return paths to market normalcy. Second, we propose a new reverse sample use of the PSY procedure for detecting crises and estimating the date of market recovery. Consistency of the dating estimators is established and the limit theory addresses new complications arising from the alternative forms of bubble implosion and the endogeneity effects present in the reverse regression. A real-time version of the strategy is provided that is suited for practical implementation. Simulations explore the finite sample performance of the strategy for dating market recovery. The use of the PSY strategy for bubble monitoring and the new procedure for crisis detection are illustrated with an application to the Nasdaq stock market.",

        "title": "Characterisation of geotechnical model uncertainty",
        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The calculated response from a numerical model will deviate from the measured one given the presence of modelling idealizations and real world construction effects. This deviation can be directly captured by a ratio between the measured and the calculated quantity. The ratio is also called a model factor in many design guides. The probabilistic distribution of the model factor is arguably the most common and simplest complete representation of model uncertainty. The characterisation of model uncertainty is identified as one of the critical elements in a geotechnical reliability-based design process in Annex D of ISO 2394:2015 “General Principles on Reliability of Structures”. This Spotlight paper reviews the databases for various geo-structures and determines their associated model statistics. Foundation load test databases are the most prevalent. A recent effort to compile a large generic database (PILE/2739) that contains 2739 field load tests conducted on various piles and installed in different soils and countries, is highlighted. This systematic compilation of load test data is part of a broader research agenda to digitalise foundation design for “precision construction”, which is targeted at characterising “site-specific” model factors and soil parameters based on both site-specific and generic data for further customisation of design to a particular site. The mean and COV of the model factor for a range of geo-structures, geomaterials, and limit states (both ultimate and serviceability) are summarized in a form suitable for adoption in design and codes of practice. Based on this summary, it is proposed that a model factor for a design model can be classified as: (1) moderately conservative (1 ≤ mean < 2), (2) highly conservative (2 ≤ mean < 3), or (3) very highly conservative (mean ≥ 3). The model uncertainty can be as: (1) low dispersion (COV < 0.3), (2) medium dispersion (0.3 ≤ COV < 0.6), (3) high dispersion (0.6 ≤ COV < 0.9), and (4) very high dispersion (COV ≥ 0.9). This summary represents the most extensive and significant update of Table 3.7.5.1 in the 2006 JCSS Probabilistic Model Code.",

        "abstract": "Cyberattacks on both databases and critical infrastructure have threatened public and private sectors. Ubiquitous tracking and wearable computing have infringed upon privacy. Advocates and engineers have recently proposed using defensive deception as a means to leverage the information asymmetry typically enjoyed by attackers as a tool for defenders. The term deception, however, has been employed broadly and with a variety of meanings. In this article, we survey 24 articles from 2008 to 2018 that use game theory to model defensive deception for cybersecurity and privacy. Then, we propose a taxonomy that defines six types of deception: perturbation, moving target defense, obfuscation, mixing, honey-x, and attacker engagement. These types are delineated by their information structures, agents, actions, and duration: precisely concepts captured by game theory. Our aims are to rigorously define types of defensive deception, to capture a snapshot of the state of the literature, to provide a menu of models that can be used for applied research, and to identify promising areas for future work. Our taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for understanding different types of defensive deception commonly encountered in cybersecurity and privacy.",

        "abstract": "Significance How fast bacteria grow influences the efficacy of β-lactams, one of the most commonly used classes of antibiotics. However, the quantitative nature of this correlation is not well established. With precise measurements and analyses enabled by experimental automation, we found a robust relationship between growth and lysis rates that is generally applicable to diverse pairs of β-lactams and bacteria. That is, the growth rate of population serves as a reliable predictor for the lysis rate in response to a β-lactam. This quantitative correlation lays the foundation for predicting bacterial population dynamics during β-lactam treatments. This predictive capability is critical for designing effective antibiotic dosing protocols, in addressing the rising antibiotic resistance crisis. It is widely acknowledged that faster-growing bacteria are killed faster by β-lactam antibiotics. This notion serves as the foundation for the concept of bacterial persistence: dormant bacterial cells that do not grow are phenotypically tolerant against β-lactam treatment. Such correlation has often been invoked in the mathematical modeling of bacterial responses to antibiotics. Due to the lack of thorough quantification, however, it is unclear whether and to what extent the bacterial growth rate can predict the lysis rate upon β-lactam treatment under diverse conditions. Enabled by experimental automation, here we measured >1,000 growth/killing curves for eight combinations of antibiotics and bacterial species and strains, including clinical isolates of bacterial pathogens. We found that the lysis rate of a bacterial population linearly depends on the instantaneous growth rate of the population, regardless of how the latter is modulated. We further demonstrate that this predictive power at the population level can be explained by accounting for bacterial responses to the antibiotic treatment by single cells. This linear dependence of the lysis rate on the growth rate represents a dynamic signature associated with each bacterium–antibiotic pair and serves as the quantitative foundation for designing combination antibiotic therapy and predicting the population-structure change in a population with mixed phenotypes.",

        "abstract": "Foundation species define the ecosystems they live in, but ecologists have often characterized dominant plants as foundational without supporting evidence. Giant kelp has long been considered a marine foundation species due to its complex structure and high productivity; however, there is little quantitative evidence to evaluate this. Here, we apply structural equation modelling to a 15-year time series of reef community data to evaluate how giant kelp affects the reef community. Although species richness was positively associated with giant kelp biomass, most direct paths did not involve giant kelp. Instead, the foundational qualities of giant kelp were driven mostly by indirect effects attributed to its dominant physical structure and associated engineering influence on the ecosystem, rather than by its use as food by invertebrates and fishes. Giant kelp structure has indirect effects because it shades out understorey algae that compete with sessile invertebrates. When released from competition, sessile species in turn increase the diversity of mobile predators. Sea urchin grazing effects could have been misinterpreted as kelp effects, because sea urchins can overgraze giant kelp, understorey algae and sessile invertebrates alike. Our results confirm the high diversity and biomass associated with kelp forests, but highlight how species interactions and habitat attributes can be misconstrued as direct consequences of a foundation species like giant kelp.",

Here we develop a high-throughput assay to measure olfactory behavior in response to well-controlled sensory stimuli. We show that odor evokes two behaviors: an upwind run during odor (ON response), and a local search at odor offset (OFF response). Wind orientation requires antennal mechanoreceptors, but search is driven solely by odor. Using dynamic odor stimuli, we measure the dependence of these two behaviors on odor intensity and history. Based on these data, we develop a navigation model that recapitulates the behavior of flies in our apparatus, and generates realistic trajectories when run in a turbulent boundary layer plume. The ability to parse olfactory navigation into quantifiable elementary sensori-motor transformations provides a foundation for dissecting neural circuits that govern olfactory behavior.",

        "abstract": "Existing measures of innovation often rely on patent citations to indicate intellectual lineage and impact. We show that the data generating process for patent citations has changed substantially since citation-based measures were validated a decade ago. Today, far more citations are created per patent, and the mean technological similarity between citing and cited patents has fallen significantly. These changes suggest that the use of patent citations for scholarship needs to be re-validated. We develop a novel vector space model to examine the information content of patent citations, and show that methods for sub-setting and/or weighting informative citations can substantially improve the predictive power of patent citation measures. We make data for a basic correction available for future scholarship through the Patent Research Foundation.",

        "abstract": "This paper looks first at some of the often unspoken epistemological, philosophical, and theoretical assumptions that are foundational to student-centered, interactive online pedagogical models. It is argued that these foundational assumptions point to the importance of learning community in the effectiveness of online learning environments. Next, a recent study of 2314 online students across thirty-two college campuses is presented. This study reports on learners’ sense of community and it is concluded through factor and regression analysis that elements of the Community of Inquiry model —specifically learners’ recognition of effective “directed facilitation” and effective instructional design and organization on the part of their instructor contributes to their sense of shared purpose, trust, connectedness, and learning—core elements of a community of learners. Gender also appears to play a small role in students’ sense of learning community with female students reporting higher levels than their male classmates. Implications for online learning environments design are discussed.",

        "abstract": "Superficial white matter mapping provides the foundation for systematic studies of this crucial structure. Superficial white matter (SWM) contains the most cortico-cortical white matter connections in the human brain encompassing the short U-shaped association fibers. Despite its importance for brain connectivity, very little is known about SWM in humans, mainly due to the lack of noninvasive imaging methods. Here, we lay the groundwork for systematic in vivo SWM mapping using ultrahigh resolution 7 T magnetic resonance imaging. Using biophysical modeling informed by quantitative ion beam microscopy on postmortem brain tissue, we demonstrate that MR contrast in SWM is driven by iron and can be linked to the microscopic iron distribution. Higher SWM iron concentrations were observed in U-fiber–rich frontal, temporal, and parietal areas, potentially reflecting high fiber density or late myelination in these areas. Our SWM mapping approach provides the foundation for systematic studies of interindividual differences, plasticity, and pathologies of this crucial structure for cortico-cortical connectivity in humans.",

This perspective proposes a transformative call for reform framed across 3 core categories: (1) creating a culture of excellence, leadership, and partnership, (2) advancing the learning sciences and understanding and enacting the social contract, and (3) implementing organizational imperatives. Similar to the Carnegie studies, this perspective identifies action items (9) that should be initiated immediately in a strategic and systematic way by the major organizational stakeholders in physical therapist education.

        "abstract": "Offshore wind turbines are a complex, dynamically sensitive structure due to their irregular mass and stiffness distribution, and complexity of the loading conditions they need to withstand. There are other challenges in particular locations such as typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes, sea-bed currents, and tsunami. Because offshore wind turbines have stringent Serviceability Limit State (SLS) requirements and need to be installed in variable and often complex ground conditions, their foundation design is challenging. Foundation design must be robust due to the enormous cost of retrofitting in a challenging environment should any problem occur during the design lifetime. Traditionally, engineers use conventional types of foundation systems, such as shallow gravity-based foundations (GBF), suction caissons, or slender piles or monopiles, based on prior experience with designing such foundations for the oil and gas industry. For offshore wind turbines, however, new types of foundations are being considered for which neither prior experience nor guidelines exist. One of the major challenges is to develop a method to de-risk the life cycle of offshore wind turbines in diverse metocean and geological conditions. The paper, therefore, has the following aims: (a) provide an overview of the complexities and the common SLS performance requirements for offshore wind turbine; (b) discuss the use of physical modelling for verification and validation of innovative design concepts, taking into account all possible angles to de-risk the project; and (c) provide examples of applications in scaled model tests.",

As the Supreme Court considers addressing constitutional questions on the issue, we propose a framework for understanding the relationships among these debates: layers of bias. In the top layer, we identify challenges to fairness within the risk-assessment models themselves. We explain types of statistical fairness and the tradeoffs between them. The second layer covers biases embedded in data. Using data from a racially biased criminal justice system can lead to unmeasurable biases in both risk scores and outcome measures. The final layer engages conceptual problems with risk models: Is it fair to make criminal justice decisions about individuals based on groups? We show that each layer depends on the layers below it: Without assurances about the foundational layers, the fairness of the top layers is irrelevant.",

        "title": "Structural Basis of Large-Scale Functional Connectivity in the Mouse",
        "abstract": "Translational neuroimaging requires approaches and techniques that can bridge between multiple different species and disease states. One candidate method that offers insights into the brain's functional connectivity (FC) is resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). In both humans and nonhuman primates, patterns of FC (often referred to as the functional connectome) have been related to the underlying structural connectivity (SC; also called the structural connectome). Given the recent rise in preclinical neuroimaging of mouse models, it is an important question whether the mouse functional connectome conforms to the underlying SC. Here, we compared FC derived from rs-fMRI in female mice with the underlying monosynaptic structural connectome as provided by the Allen Brain Connectivity Atlas. We show that FC between interhemispheric homotopic cortical and hippocampal areas, as well as in cortico-striatal pathways, emerges primarily via monosynaptic structural connections. In particular, we demonstrate that the striatum (STR) can be segregated according to differential rs-fMRI connectivity patterns that mirror monosynaptic connectivity with isocortex. In contrast, for certain subcortical networks, FC emerges along polysynaptic pathways as shown for left and right STR, which do not share direct anatomical connections, but high FC is putatively driven by a top-down cortical control. Finally, we show that FC involving cortico-thalamic pathways is limited, possibly confounded by the effect of anesthesia, small regional size, and tracer injection volume. These findings provide a critical foundation for using rs-fMRI connectivity as a translational tool to study complex brain circuitry interactions and their pathology due to neurological or psychiatric diseases across species. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT A comprehensive understanding of how the anatomical architecture of the brain, often referred to as the “connectome,” corresponds to its function is arguably one of the biggest challenges for understanding the brain and its pathologies. Here, we use the mouse as a model for comparing functional connectivity (FC) derived from resting-state fMRI with gold standard structural connectivity measures based on tracer injections. In particular, we demonstrate high correspondence between FC measurements of cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal regions and their anatomical underpinnings. This work provides a critical foundation for studying the pathology of these circuits across mouse models and human patients.",

        "abstract": "Funding information National Science Foundation, Grant/Award Number: CBET-1804407 Abstract In this work, we propose the integration of Koopman operator methodology with Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC) for stabilization of nonlinear systems. The Koopman operator enables global linear representations of nonlinear dynamical systems. The basic idea is to transform the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space using a set of observable functions whose evolution is governed by the linear but infinite dimensional Koopman operator. In practice, it is numerically approximated and therefore the tightness of these linear representations cannot be guaranteed which may lead to unstable closed-loop designs. To address this issue, we integrate the Koopman linear predictors in an LMPC framework which guarantees controller feasibility and closed-loop stability. Moreover, the proposed design results in a standard convex optimization problem which is computationally attractive compared to a nonconvex problem encountered when the original nonlinear model is used. We illustrate the application of this methodology on a chemical process example.",

Mori–Tanaka model is employed to describe gradually distribution of material properties along the plate thickness. Size-dependency of nanosize FG plate is captured via the nonlocal elasticity theory of Eringen. By implementing Hamilton\\'s principle the equations of motion are obtained for a refined four-variable shear deformation plate theory and then solved analytically. To show the accuracy of the present theory, our research results in specific cases are compared with available results in the literature and a good agreement will be demonstrated.

        "abstract": "A metamodeling for the nucleonic equation of state (EOS), inspired from a Taylor expansion around the saturation density of symmetric nuclear matter, is proposed and parameterized in terms of the empirical parameters. The present knowledge of nuclear empirical parameters is first reviewed in order to estimate their average values and associated uncertainties, and thus defining the parameter space of the metamodeling. They are divided into isoscalar and isovector type, and ordered according to their power in the density expansion. The goodness of the metamodeling is analyzed against the predictions of the original models. In addition, since no correlation among the empirical parameters is assumed a priori, all arbitrary density dependences can be explored, which might not be accessible in existing functionals. Spurious correlations due to the assumed functional form are also removed. This meta-EOS allows direct relations between the uncertainties on the empirical parameters and the density dependence of the nuclear equation of state and its derivatives, and the mapping between the two can be done with standard Bayesian techniques. A sensitivity analysis shows that the more influential empirical parameters are the isovector parameters $L_{sym}$ and $K_{sym}$, and that laboratory constraints at super-saturation densities are essential to reduce the present uncertainties. The present metamodeling for the EOS for nuclear matter is proposed for further applications in neutron stars and supernova matter.",

However, alongside its widespread dissemination, and in light of multiple conceptual models, lists, and frameworks, some dilution and confusion is apparent. This scoping review represents an attempt to take stock of SDOH literature in the context of contemporary population and public health. Methods We conducted a scoping review to synthesize and map SDOH literature, informed by the methods of Arksey and O’Malley (2005). We searched 5 academic and 3 grey literature databases for “social determinants of health” and “population health” or “public health” or “health promotion,” published 2004–2014. We also conducted a search on “inequity” or “inequality” or “disparity” or “social gradient” and “Canad*” to ensure that we captured articles where this language was used to discuss the SDOH. We included articles that discussed SDOH in depth, either explicitly or in implicit but nuanced ways. We hand-searched reference lists to further identify relevant articles. Findings Our synthesis of 108 articles showed wide variation by study setting, target audience, and geographic scope, with most articles published in an academic setting, by Canadian authors, for policy-maker audiences. SDOH were communicated by authors as a list, model, or story; each with strengths and weaknesses. Thematic analysis identified one theme: health equity as an overarching and binding concept to the SDOH. Health equity was understood in different ways with implications for action on the SDOH. Conclusions Among the vast SDOH literature, there is a need to identify and clearly articulate the essence and implications of the SDOH concept. We recommend that authors be intentional in their efforts to present and discuss SDOH to ensure that they speak to its foundational concept of health equity.",

Point ii) is the focus of this paper: it discusses principles for objective Bayesian model comparison, and singles out some major concepts for building priors, which are subsequently illustrated in some detail for the classic problem of variable selection in normal linear models. We also present some recent contributions in the area of objective priors on model space.

        "abstract": "With the rise of the Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field, defect datasets extracted from software repositories play a foundational role in many empirical studies related to software quality. At the core of defect data preparation is the identification of post-release defects. Prior studies leverage many heuristics (e.g., keywords and issue IDs) to identify post-release defects. However, such the heuristic approach is based on several assumptions, which pose common threats to the validity of many studies. In this paper, we set out to investigate the nature of the difference of defect datasets generated by the heuristic approach and the realistic approach that leverages the earliest affected release that is realistically estimated by a software development team for a given defect. In addition, we investigate the impact of defect identification approaches on the predictive accuracy and the ranking of defective modules that are produced by defect models. Through a case study of defect datasets of 32 releases, we find that that the heuristic approach has a large impact on both defect count datasets and binary defect datasets. Surprisingly, we find that the heuristic approach has a minimal impact on defect count models, suggesting that future work should not be too concerned about defect count models that are constructed using heuristic defect datasets. On the other hand, using defect datasets generated by the realistic approach lead to an improvement in the predictive accuracy of defect classification models.",

Whilst numerical studies have been carried out to demonstrate the potential benefits of GSI‐RSM system, experimental research is indispensable for confirming its isolation mechanism and effectiveness in reducing structural demand. In this regard, centrifuge modelling with an earthquake shaker under an acceleration field of 50 g adopted in this study can mimic the actual nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of RSM and subsoil in a coupled soil‐foundation‐structure system. This is the first time the performance of GSI‐RSM system was examined in a geotechnical centrifuge. It was found that an average of 40‐50% reduction of structural demand can be achieved. The increase in both the horizontal and rotation responses of the foundation was also evidenced. The unique augmented rocking mechanism with reversible foundation rotation was highlighted.",

The empirical results show that the effects of three ECM factors (satisfaction with prior learning experience, confirmation with prior learning experience, and perceived usefulness) are significant. Different factors have different predicting power. Knowledge outcome is the first powerful indicator of learners’ continuance intention of MOOCs, followed by social influence, learners’ satisfaction with prior learning experience, and performance proficiency.

The studies of human mobility modeling and prediction play a vital role in a series of applications such as urban planning, epidemic control, location-based services, and intelligent transportation management. In this survey, we review human mobility models based on a human-centric angle in a datadriven context. Specifically, we characterize human mobility patterns from individual, collective, and hybrid levels. Meanwhile, we survey human mobility prediction methods from four aspects and then describe recent development respectively. Finally, we discuss some open issues that provide a helpful reference for researchers' future direction.

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT The field of learning analytics was founded with the goal to harness vast amounts of data about learning collected by the extensive use of technology. After the early formation, the field has now entered the next phase of maturation with a growing community who has an evident impact on research, practice, policy, and decision-making. Although learning analytics is a bricolage field borrowing from many related other disciplines, there is still no systematised model that shows how these different disciplines are pieced together. Existing models and frameworks of learning analytics are valuable in identifying elements and processes of learning analytics, but they insufficiently elaborate on the links with foundational disciplines. With this in mind, this paper proposes a consolidated model of the field of research and practice that is composed of three mutually connected dimensions – theory, design, and data science. The paper defines why and how each of the three dimensions along with their mutual relations is critical for research and practice of learning analytics. Finally, the paper stresses the importance of multi-perspective approaches to learning analytics based on its three core dimensions for a healthy development of the field and a sustainable impact on research and practice.",

A detailed parametric study is performed to clarify the effect of various factors such as axial material gradation and size-dependent parameters on the divergence and flutter instability thresholds of the system. To model the micro and nanofluidic systems, modified couple stress theory (MCST) and nonlocal strain gradient theory (NSGT) are implemented, respectively. The backward and forward vibrational frequencies, as well as critical divergence spin and fluid velocities of the system, are obtained. It is concluded that the stability evolution of spinning micro and nanostructures containing fluid can be altered by fine-adjustment of axial material gradation. Besides, it is found that the enhancement of elastic modulus gradient, strain gradient, material length scale, and foundation parameters improve the dynamical stability of the small-scale structures.",

        "abstract": "Looking for a strange metal In many materials, charge carriers are well described as noninteracting quasiparticles. However, in materials with strong correlations, this approximation can break down, leading to anomalous transport properties at high temperatures. Huang et al. used quantum Monte Carlo calculations to look for this so-called strange metal phase in the simplest two-dimensional model of interacting electrons, the Hubbard model. They found that the calculated resistivity had a linear temperature dependence when hole doping was introduced, as expected in the strange metal phase. This observation provides confidence that simplified models can be used to describe and understand the behavior of real materials, such as cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Science, this issue p. 987 Quantum Monte Carlo calculations indicate the presence of anomalous transport in the normal state of the 2D Hubbard model. Strange or bad metallic transport, defined by incompatibility with the conventional quasiparticle picture, is a theme common to many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors. The Hubbard model represents a minimal starting point for modeling strongly correlated systems. Here we demonstrate strange metallic transport in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Over a wide range of doping, we observe resistivities exceeding the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit with linear temperature dependence. The temperatures of our calculations extend to as low as 1/40 of the noninteracting bandwidth, placing our findings in the degenerate regime relevant to experimental observations of strange metallicity. Our results provide a foundation for connecting theories of strange metals to models of strongly correlated materials.",

In this paper, a new method, called parallel SAEA for electromagnetic design (PSAED), is proposed. A state-of-the-art SAEA framework, surrogate model-aware evolutionary search, is used as the foundation of PSAED. Considering the landscape characteristics of EM design problems, three differential evolution mutation operators are selected and organized in a particular way. A new SAEA framework is then proposed to make use of the selected mutation operators in a parallel computing environment. PSAED is tested by a micromirror and a dielectric resonator antenna as well as four mathematical benchmark problems of various complexity. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods verify the advantages of PSAED in terms of efficiency and optimization capacity.",

        "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, there has been a growing interest and investment in ‘character’ education across the UK political landscape. Alongside the activities of central government, character education has been promoted by a range of non-government actors in the UK and beyond, including philanthropic foundations, think tanks, education entrepreneurs, and academics. It is the presence of these actors and their relationship to, and influence on, UK government policy that we examine in this article. Investigating character education from a perspective of policy formation and influence, we trace the key policy actors who have contributed to the adoption of character education in the UK, and their international connections, identifying the resources, activities and relationships through which they have achieved policy influence. A central and original contribution of this article is in identifying the financial and ideological influence of US Christian neoconservative philanthropic foundation the John Templeton Foundation on social science research and policy in the UK. Our analysis identifies academics in the UK and US who, through considerable John Templeton Foundation funding, have provided an evidence base that authorises character education as a policy solution. We also locate ‘policy entrepreneurs’ as key nodal actors, whose social capital and elite membership helps to lubricate network relations and facilitate policy influence. Finally, we consider the motivations and vested interests of policy actors, including the John Templeton Foundation’s particular model of philanthropy, and conclude that the character education agenda is underpinned by a set of ideas that promote a free-market, individualistic and socially conservative worldview.",

Here, we develop a model of listening engagement (MoLE) that provides a conceptual foundation to understand when people engage in listening and why some people disengage. We use the term \"listening engagement\" to describe the recruitment of executive and other cognitive resources in the service of a valued communication goal. Listening engagement, listening motivation, and listening experiences are closely interconnected: motivation and other factors determine the degree to which resources are recruited during listening, which in turn influences subjective listening experiences such as enjoyment, effort, frustration, and boredom. We anticipate that this model will help researchers assess more accurately whether a person with hearing difficulties is at risk of disengagement and social withdrawal. It is further useful to more comprehensively characterize a person's listening experiences in laboratory settings when rich, engaging stimulus materials, such as spoken stories, are used. We hope this model will allow new questions in applied and basic hearing science and auditory cognitive neuroscience to be asked and answered.",

Their dysfunction is associated with psychiatric, neurological and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia, epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease. Understanding their biophysical and pharmacological properties, at both the functional and the structural level, thus holds many therapeutic promises. In addition to their agonist‐elicited activation, most pLGICs display another key allosteric property, namely desensitization, in which they enter a shut state refractory to activation upon sustained agonist binding. While the activation mechanisms of several pLGICs have been revealed at near‐atomic resolution, the structural foundation of desensitization has long remained elusive. Recent structural and functional data now suggest that the activation and desensitization gates are distinct, and are located at both sides of the ion channel. Such a ‘dual gate mechanism’ accounts for the marked allosteric effects of channel blockers, a feature illustrated herein by theoretical kinetics simulations.

        "abstract": "The paper herein will analyze the sale of iced products affected by variation of temperature. Firstly, we will collect the data of the forecast temperature last year and the sale of iced products and then conduct data compilation and cleansing. Finally, we will set up the mathematical regression analysis model based on the cleansed data by means of data mining theory. Regression analysis refers to the method of studying the relationship between independent variable and dependent variable. Linear regression model that corresponds to the practical situation is proposed in the paper, which is to set up simple linear regression model based on practical problem and then to implement the following with the help of the latest and most popular Python3.6. Python3.6 boasts the features of pure object-oriented, platform independence and concise and elegant language. So we will call the corresponding library function to predict the sale of iced products according to the variation of temperature, which will provide the foundation for the company to adjust its production each month, or even each week and each day. As a result, the situation of overproduction can be avoided. Moreover, the other situation as the profit will be affected by the lack of production since the rise of temperature will also be avoided. So the regression model also has reference value for the other fields of marketing.",

        "abstract": "With the recent progress in indoor spatial data modeling, indoor mapping and indoor positioning technologies, several spatial information services for indoor spaces have been provided like for outdoor spaces. In order to support interoperability between indoor spatial information services, IndoorGML was published by OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) as a standard data model and XML-based exchange format. While the previous standards, such as IFC (Industrial Foundation Classes) and CityGML covering also indoor space, aim at feature modeling, the goal of IndoorGML is to establish a standard basis for the indoor space model. As IndoorGML defines a minimum data model for indoor space, more efforts are required to discover its potential aspects, which are not explicitly explained in the standard document. In this paper, we investigate the implications and potential aspects of IndoorGML and its basic concept of the cellular space model and discuss the implementation issues of IndoorGML for several purposes. In particular, we discuss the issues on cell determination, subspacing and the hierarchical structure of indoor space from the IndoorGML viewpoint. Additionally, we also focus on two important issues: computation of indoor distance and the implementation of indoor context-awareness services based on IndoorGML. We expect that this paper will serve as a technical document for better understanding of IndoorGML throughout these discussions.",

Recently, even the use of plasmas in medical applications has made great progress. The dominant character of a plasma is often its non equilibrium nature with different temperatures for the individual species in a plasma, the ions, electrons and neutrals. This opens up a multitude of reaction pathways which are inaccessible to conventional methods in chemistry, for example. The understanding of plasmas requires expertise in plasma physics, plasma chemistry and in electrical engineering. This first paper in a series of foundation papers on low temperature plasma science is intended to provide the very basics of plasmas as a common starting point for the more in-depth discussion of particular plasma generation methods, plasma modeling and diagnostics in the other foundation papers. In this first paper of the series, the common terminology, definitions and main concepts are introduced. The covered aspects start with the basic definitions and include further plasma equilibria, particle collisions and transport, sheaths and discharge breakdowns.",

Focus groups (N = 44) conducted with second language (L2) practitioners and teacher educators and a cluster analysis of questionnaire data with a larger sample (N = 293) of K–12 language teachers were used to identify and corroborate typical archetypes across the spectrum of language teacher immunity outcomes. Serial in‐depth interviews were then conducted with representative respondents from each archetype (N = 18) to trace developmental trajectories and investigate how these profiles manifested phenomenologically in teachers’ motivated thought and instructional practices. Results indicate that teacher immunity is associated with practitioners’ psychological, emotional, and cognitive functioning in the social setting of the L2 classroom. These findings contribute to the field's understanding of how language teachers sustain their adaptivity, openness to change, psychological well‐being, and their sense of purpose and investment in students’ learning. Thus, teacher immunity has the potential to bridge individual and situative concerns in second language teacher education and the psychology of language teaching and learning.",

While questions are often asked with respect to long documents, there are many challenges with modeling such long documents. Many existing techniques generate questions by effectively looking at one sentence at a time, leading to questions that are easy and not reflective of the human process of question generation. Our goal is to incorporate interactions across multiple sentences to generate realistic questions for long documents. In order to link a broad document context to the target answer, we represent the relevant context via a multi-stage attention mechanism, which forms the foundation of a sequence to sequence model.

These studies identified curricular structures, instructional practices, assessment approaches, and environmental characteristics that support the preparation of professionals and led to educational reforms. The physical therapy profession has not had any in-depth, national investigation of physical therapist education since the Catherine Worthingham studies conducted more than 50 years ago.\n\n\nObjectives\nThis research was a Carnegie-type study, investigating elements of excellence and innovation in academic and clinical physical therapist education in the United States.\n\n\nDesign\nFive physical therapist education researchers from across the United States used a qualitative multiple-case study design.\n\n\nMethods\nSix academic and 5 clinical programs were selected for the study. The academic institutions and clinical agencies studied were diverse in size, institutional setting, geography, and role in residency education. Qualitative case studies were generated from review of artifacts, field observations, and interviews (individual and focus group), and they provided the data for the study.\n\n\nResults\nA conceptual framework grounded in 3 major dimensions was generated, with 8 supporting elements: (1) culture of excellence (shared beliefs and values, leadership and vision, drive for excellence, and partnerships), (2) praxis of learning (signature pedagogy, practice-based learning, creating adaptive learners, and professional formation), and (3) organizational structures and resources.\n\n\nConclusion\nBuilding on the work of the Carnegie Foundation's Preparation for the Professions Program, a conceptual model was developed, representing the dimensions and elements of excellence in physical therapist education that is centered on the foundational importance of a nexus of linked and highly valued aims of being learner centered and patient centered in all learning environments, both academic and clinical.",

        "abstract": "With the development of the Chinese transportation industry, the number of bridges has increased significantly, but this results in high pressure of structural maintenance and management. Bridge management system (BMS) is critical for efficient maintenance and ensured safety of bridge structures during long-term operation. Building information modeling (BIM) is an emerging technology with powerful visualization and informatization capability, making it an ideal tool for developing modern management systems. This paper introduces the development of a bridge management system based on the BIM technology. Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and International Framework for Dictionaries (IFD) standards are studied and extended, and coding rules are proposed for the Chinese bridge industry. Also, a standard structural modeling method is proposed to fast build the bridge BIM model. Web-BIM oriented bridge management is proposed, and portable devices are introduced into the system. Collaborative management is realized for different users. The BIM-based maintenance management system is designed. Finally, a practical BIM-based BMS is established for a long-span cable-stayed bridge in China. This system integrates the BIM with the geographic information system (GIS) and contains information management, inspection management, technical condition evaluation, and enables users to cooperate with each other. Such a BMS could help to improve the management efficiency and ensure its normal operation, providing a useful platform for the maintenance of massive bridges in China.",

In this critical qualitative inquiry grounded in critical race theory and sociopolitical perspectives on teaching and learning, I analyzed the contradictions that emerged in science teaching practices that were both intended to support Student of Color science learning and engaged science-specific colorblind ideologies. The critical race theory analysis demonstrated how science teaching practices such as connecting to students’ experiences, creating interests in science, representing scientists as role models, and scaffolding doing science maintain unequal racialized power relations between students and science when historical and contemporary legacies of racism are not directly confronted. I also propose a science teaching practice of “grappling with racism” as a possible transformative solution to disrupt racism in and through science teaching.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new size-dependent quasi-3D plate theory is presented for wave dispersion analysis of functionally graded nanoplates while resting on an elastic foundation and under the hygrothermaal environment. This quasi-3D plate theory considers both thickness stretching influences and shear deformation with the variations of displacements in the thickness direction as a parabolic function. Moreover, the stress-free boundary conditions on both sides of the plate are satisfied without using a shear correction factor. This theory includes five independent unknowns with results in only five governing equations. Size effects are obtained via a higher-order nonlocal strain gradient theory of elasticity. A variational approach is adopted to owning the governing equations employing Hamilton\\'s principle. Solving analytically via Fourier series, these equations gives wave frequencies and phase velocities as a function of wave numbers. The validity of the present results is examined by comparing them with those of the known data in the literature. Parametric studies are conducted for material composition, size dependency, two parametric elastic foundation, temperature and moisture differences, and wave number. Some conclusions are drawn from the parametric studies with respect to the wave characteristics.",

The elastic foundation is modeled as two-parameter Pasternak foundation. The proposed two-variable refined plate theory takes account of transverse shear influences and parabolic variation of the transverse shear strains within the thickness of the plate by introducing undetermined integral terms, hence it is unnecessary to use shear correction factors. Nonlocal governing equations for the single layered graphene sheet are obtained from the principle of virtual displacements. The proposed theory is compared with other plate theories. Analytical solutions for buckling loads are obtained for single-layered graphene sheets with isotropic and orthotropic properties.

        "abstract": "Formalized knowledge representation is the foundation of Big Data computing, mining and visualization. Current knowledge representations regard information as items linked to relevant objects or concepts by tree or graph structures. However, geographic knowledge differs from general knowledge, which is more focused on temporal, spatial, and changing knowledge. Thus, discrete knowledge items are difficult to represent geographic states, evolutions, and mechanisms, e.g., the processes of a storm “{9:30-60 mm-precipitation}-{12:00-80 mm-precipitation}-…”. The underlying problem is the constructors of the logic foundation (ALC description language) of current geographic knowledge representations, which cannot provide these descriptions. To address this issue, this study designed a formalized geographic knowledge representation called GeoKG and supplemented the constructors of the ALC description language. Then, an evolution case of administrative divisions of Nanjing was represented with the GeoKG. In order to evaluate the capabilities of our formalized model, two knowledge graphs were constructed by using the GeoKG and the YAGO by using the administrative division case. Then, a set of geographic questions were defined and translated into queries. The query results have shown that GeoKG results are more accurate and complete than the YAGO’s with the enhancing state information. Additionally, the user evaluation verified these improvements, which indicates it is a promising powerful model for geographic knowledge representation.",

The model involves three strength parameters: the undrained shear strengths in triaxial compression, triaxial extension, and simple shear. The amount of physical anisotropy implied by the model is a function of the relative magnitude of these three strengths assuming a Mises‐type plastic potential. Elastoplastic deformation characteristics below failure are accounted for by a hardening law requiring two additional parameters that can be related to the axial strains halfway to failure in triaxial compression and extension. Finally, elasticity is accounted for by Hooke law. The result is a relatively simple model whose parameters can all be inferred directly from a combination of in situ and standard undrained laboratory tests. The model is applied to a problem involving the horizontal loading of a monopile foundation for which full scale tests have been previously conducted. The model shows good agreement with the measured data.",

As human–agent teaming (HAT) becomes more prevalent as a research topic, the need to understand humans’ psychological perceptions of the machine partner is increasingly important, especially in terms of its perceived role, which may ultimately impact trust and team effectiveness. Specifically, it remains unclear how humans perceive intelligent agents and how consistent these perceptions are with existing taxonomies found in the psychology of teams. The present paper presents a definition of the construct of autonomous agent teammate-likeness (AAT) and a conceptual model of its components, reviews related concepts and germane research and proffers a number of propositions to guide future research. The goal is to contribute to the nascent literature on HAT by establishing a theoretical foundation for the AAT construct, upon which researchers can advance research on HAT.",

On the academic front, there has been much enthusiasm around the potential of CSPAPs to positively affect youth physical activity behaviors and trajectories. However, program uptake in schools has yet to take hold. This article examines the CSPAP model and proposes an illustrative supplement to enhance communication about its application. The authors begin by charting the model’s challenging contextual landscape and then highlight the model’s early successes in spite of such challenges. Subsequently, they turn their attention to limitations in the way the model is presented, which appear to undermine CSPAP advocacy, and focus on improving the messaging about CSPAPs as an immediate step toward increased implementation.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, a new nonlocal trigonometric shear deformation theory is proposed for thermal buckling response of nanosize functionally graded (FG) nano-plates resting on two-parameter elastic foundation under various types of thermal environments. This theory uses for the first time, undetermined integral variables and it contains only four unknowns, that is \neven less than the first shear deformation theory (FSDT). It is considered that the FG nano-plate is exposed to uniform, linear and sinusoidal temperature rises. Mori-Tanaka model is utilized to define the gradually variation of material properties along the plate thickness. Nonlocal elasticity theory of Eringen is employed to capture the size influences. Through the stationary potential energy the governing equations are derived for a refined nonlocal four-variable shear deformation plate theory and then solved analytically. A variety of examples is proposed to demonstrate the importance of elastic foundation parameters, various temperature fields, nonlocality, material composition, aspect and side-to-thickness ratios on critical stability temperatures of FG nano-plate.",

        "abstract": "Many cases of artificial soft clay foundation constructed by hydraulic filling and improved by the vacuum preloading show the clogging phenomenon in the surrounding soil, which compromises the improvement quality. To clarify the clogging mechanism and the formation of soil columns, the vacuum process was tracked from macro to micro by laboratory model tests. Results show that the soil column with higher strength (density) and lower water content was formed surrounding the prefabricated vertical drainage (PVD). Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests revealed that the pore-entrance diameter of the soil column after 50 and 43 days of vacuum application ranged from 100 to 600 nm, and that at peak it is 300 nm. However, the mean diameter of the colloidal particles in tail water decreases from 1000 to 100 nm with continuous vacuum application, and then becomes stable at about 100 nm after 43 days. After re-visiting the vacuum process of the hydraulic reclamation mud, the pore-size distribution of surrounding soils and particle-size distribution of the tail water, the clogging was explained by the filling of the pores of the soil column by the colloidal particles in pore water. This mechanism differentiates the artificial foundation improved by vacuum preloading from the natural foundation for the presence of rich colloidal particles in pore water.",

We conceptualize collective intuition as independently formed judgement based on domain-specific knowledge, experience and cognitive ability, shared and interpreted collectively. We contribute to intuition research, which has tended to focus its attention at the individual level, by studying intuition collectively in team settings. From a dual-process perspective, we investigate how expert intuition and deliberation affect decision making and learning at various levels of the organization. Furthermore, we contribute to organizational learning research by offering an empirically derived elaboration of the foundational 4I framework, identifying additional ‘feed-forward’ and ‘feedback’ loop processes, and thereby providing a more complete account of this organizational learning model. Bridging a variety of relevant but previously unconnected literatures via our focal concept of collective intuition, our research provides a foundation for future studies of this vitally important but under-researched organizational phenomenon. We offer theoretical and practical implications whereby expert intuitions can be developed and leveraged collectively as valuable sources of organizational knowledge and learning, and contribute to improved decision making in organizations.",

The single layered graphene sheet and zinc oxide layers are subjected, respectively, to 2D magnetic and 3D electric fields. Structural damping and surface effects are assumed using Kelvin–Voigt and Gurtin–Murdoch theories, respectively. The system is rested on an elastic medium which is simulated with a novel model namely as orthotropic visco-Pasternak foundation. An exact solution is applied in order to obtain the frequency, cut-off and escape frequencies. A displacement and velocity feedback control algorithm is applied for the active control of the frequency through a closed-loop control with bonded distributed zinc oxide sensors and actuators. The detailed parametric study is conducted, focusing on the combined effects of the nonlocal parameter, magnetic field, viscoelastic foundation, surface stress, applied voltage, velocity feedback control gain and structural damping on the wave propagation behavior of nanostructure. Results depict that with increasing the structural damping coefficient, frequency significantly decreases.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Interprofessional education (IPE) and interprofessional collaborative practice (ICP) are essential to achieving high-quality patient care. Leading IPE/ICP requires training in new knowledge and skills that most health professions faculty and clinicians lack. To guide this training, the Interprofessional Education Collaborative (IPEC) defined interprofessional collaboration through four core competencies: (a) Values/Ethics for Interprofessional Practice, (b) Roles/Responsibilities, (c) Interprofessional Communication, and (d) Teams and Teamwork. For IPE/ICP training to be effective, it is necessary to identify new educational models that provide an operational framework for these competencies. The University of Virginia (UVA) ASPIRE Model is a new paradigm for developing IPE/ICP educational experiences. It was created by mapping the IPEC competencies to three overlapping curricular content areas: (a) Practical Tools, (b) Leadership, and (c) Relational Factors. This model shows the relationship among the four IPEC core competencies and corresponding sub-competency statements and their inclusion in one or more of these three curricular content areas. The UVA ASPIRE Model was empirically tested as an approach to provide IPE/ICP training through “real-world” application for clinicians and faculty participating in an intensive team development program. Positive evaluations and improved capabilities of learners to apply their new knowledge and skills to solving real-world clinical challenges revealed that the UVA ASPIRE Model is an effective approach to embed the IPEC competencies in the design of IPE/ICP educational activities.",

We argue both applications of the NAM are problematic. The roots of wildlife conservation in North America are more complex than those associated with the NAM, and minimizing contributions from diverse sources makes building a diverse wildlife conservation community more difficult than it would otherwise be. The NAM is not inclusive enough of diversity among wildlife species or stakeholders. Principles labeled the bedrock foundation of the NAM exist in flux and at the whim of political systems. Belief that the NAM reflects a foundation of laws more stable than the milieu of governance structures shaping wildlife management can encourage complacency among wildlife conservation advocates. Wildlife management exists in systems too complex to be beneficially defined by a terse list of principles.",

        "abstract": "In the current state of development, it is very hard to remotely evaluate the actual condition of wind turbines structures. This makes it impossible for a wind farm owner to correctly deliberate about the need of retrofitting the current wind turbine structure, as well as to decide about the possible extension of its operating lifetime. Taking into account this problem, this paper introduces the main aspects in the development of a vibration‐based monitoring system for an onshore 2.0‐MW wind turbine based on the identification of the modal properties of the most important vibration modes. Initially, the wind turbine is introduced, as well as the implemented monitoring system. Then, the main steps of the monitoring system are briefly described. A detailed attention is given to the statistical procedure based on regression models used to minimize the influence of operational and environmental effects over the features used to detect structural changes in the wind turbine. Lastly, the suitability of the system to detect damages is thus assessed, through the analysis of three common damage scenarios: onshore foundation damage; damage by scour on an offshore foundation; and blade damage. It is concluded that the system is capable of detecting damage in onshore and offshore foundations, as well as in rotor blades. The most important contribution of the paper is the definition of monitoring framework for damage detection, its implementation, and validation with monitoring data collected during more than 1 year in a utility‐scale wind turbine.",

While Ahuja's work has been regularly cited in the IT workforce literature (citation count was around 120 using ISI Web of Science and around 425 using Google Scholar as of September 30, 2017), women continue to leave the IT profession at a disturbing rate. Using Ahuja's theoretical model as the foundation, this study asked women working in IT what workplace challenges they face. The findings from this study validate many of Ahuja's propositions and suggest an extended theoretical model that could be used to further explore the challenges women face at various career stages in the IT field.

        "abstract": "In classical physics, the Kolmogorov extension theorem lays the foundation for the theory of stochastic processes. It has been known for a long time that, in its original form, this theorem does not hold in quantum mechanics. More generally, it does not hold in any theory of stochastic processes -- classical, quantum or beyond -- that does not just describe passive observations, but allows for active interventions. Such processes form the basis of the study of causal modelling across the sciences, including in the quantum domain. To date, these frameworks have lacked a conceptual underpinning similar to that provided by Kolmogorov’s theorem for classical stochastic processes. We prove a generalized extension theorem that applies to all theories of stochastic processes, putting them on equally firm mathematical ground as their classical counterpart. Additionally, we show that quantum causal modelling and quantum stochastic processes are equivalent. This provides the correct framework for the description of experiments involving continuous control, which play a crucial role in the development of quantum technologies. Furthermore, we show that the original extension theorem follows from the generalized one in the correct limit, and elucidate how a comprehensive understanding of general stochastic processes allows one to unambiguously define the distinction between those that are classical and those that are quantum.",

        "abstract": "The technological foundation of smart manufacturing consists of cyber-physical systems and the Internet-of-Things (IoT). Each IoT device in a smart factory can be coupled with a digital twin, that is, a dynamic virtual representation of the physical system across its life-cycle using real-time sensor data. Currently, the manufacturing process itself, the involved devices, and how they interact, is designed by human experts in a traditional way. We envision an architecture where humans can instead specify a goal and take advantage of technologies such as digital twins to automatically compose the corresponding physical processes, sharing some analogies with the notion of Web service composition",

        "abstract": "Soft robots made from soft materials outperform traditional rigid robots in safety, maneuverability, and adaptability. Various methods have been proposed to actuate soft robots such as cables, pneumatic, or smart materials (e.g., shape memory alloys, dielectric elastomer, or ionic polymer-metal composites, etc.). In this paper, we propose to leverage a recently discovered artificial muscle—twisted-and-coiled actuators (TCAs)—to actuate soft robots. Compared with existing actuation methods, TCAs can be actuated electronically, can be embedded inside soft materials to enable distributed actuation, and are easy and low-cost to manufacture. We establish a general modeling framework for TCAs and TCA-actuated soft robots, including a physics-based model for TCAs as well as both the forward and inverse kinetostatics for TCA-actuated soft robots, where a coupling between TCA actuation and deformation of soft robots exists. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the proposed models. The presented work will not only lay a theoretical foundation for using TCAs to actuate soft robots but also enable wider application for TCA-actuated soft robots (e.g., manipulation or locomotion).",

        "abstract": "This White Paper defines empowerment of women and girls as 'the expansion of choice and strengthening of voice through the transformation of power relations, so women and girls have more control over their lives and futures'. Empowerment is both a process and an outcome. This White Paper presents a conceptual model on women and girls' empowerment, and has been developed by KIT Gender for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The model is informed by existing empowerment frameworks and approaches. It builds on the long history of theory and practice in women and girls’ empowerment, existing operational frameworks and critical reflections on how these frameworks have been operationalised over the past 20 years and what can be learnt from this wealth of experience. The model asserts that expanding women and girls’ choice and voice engages directly with how power operates as a force in their lives; empowerment challenges disempowerment and the systemic constraints on women’s and girls’ choice and voice. These constraints are due to gender relations and how they intersect with age, class, ethnicity, caste, religion, sexual orientation, race and other social markers. Transformation of power relations occurs through women and girls exercising agency and taking action. It entails a redistribution of resources towards women and girls and a shift in the institutional structures that shape their choices and voice. Women and girls' decision-making, leadership and collective action are central to empowerment processes. Additionally advancing gender equality and empowerment of women and girls also calls for the active engagement of men and boys.",

Nevertheless, quantitative approaches are needed to capture the landscape of RNA/RBP interactions responsible for cellular regulation. We have used the RNA-MaP platform to directly measure equilibrium binding for thousands of designed RNAs and to construct a predictive model for RNA recognition by the human Pumilio proteins PUM1 and PUM2. Despite prior findings of linear sequence motifs, our measurements revealed widespread residue flipping and instances of positional coupling. Application of our thermodynamic model to published in vivo crosslinking data reveals quantitative agreement between predicted affinities and in vivo occupancies. Our analyses suggest a thermodynamically driven, continuous Pumilio binding landscape that is negligibly affected by RNA structure or kinetic factors, such as displacement by ribosomes. This work provides a quantitative foundation for dissecting the cellular behavior of RBPs and cellular features that impact their occupancies.",

The model proposes that enduring involvement has both a direct and moderating influence on tourists' satisfaction with the destination. Data were collected from 1091 visitors of two museums in Barcelona: the Picasso Museum and the Miro Foundation. The results suggest that visit experience, service quality and involvement are drivers of satisfaction. Satisfaction influences the behavioral intentions of visitors to the museum. In addition, the visitors' level of art involvement negatively moderates the influence of perceived quality and experience on tourists' satisfaction. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The propagation approach of a botnet largely dictates its formation, establishing a foundation of bots for future exploitation. The chosen propagation method determines the attack surface and, consequently, the degree of network penetration, as well as the overall size and the eventual attack potency. It is therefore essential to understand propagation behaviours and influential factors in order to better secure vulnerable systems. Whilst botnet propagation is generally well studied, newer technologies like IoT have unique characteristics which are yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we apply the principles of epidemic modelling to IoT networks consisting of wireless sensor nodes. We build IoT-SIS, a novel propagation model which considers the impact of IoT-specific characteristics like limited processing power, energy restrictions, and node density on the formation of a botnet. Focusing on worm-based propagation, this model is used to explore the dynamics of spread using numerical simulations and the Monte Carlo method to discuss the real-life implications of our findings.",

We demonstrate Proverbot9001 on the proof obligations from a large practical proof project, the CompCert verified C compiler, and show that it can effectively automate what were previously manual proofs, automatically producing proofs for 28% of theorem statements in our test dataset, when combined with solver-based tooling. Without any additional solvers, we exhibit a proof completion rate that is a 4X improvement over prior state-of-the-art machine learning models for generating proofs in Coq.",

This paper presents a foundational model that facilitates a comprehensive yet manageable approach to qualitative data analysis, and it can be applied within an array of qualitative methodologies. Based on an exhaustive review of expert qualitative methodologists, along with our own experience of teaching qualitative research, this model synthesises commonly-used analytic strategies and methods that are likewise applicable to novice qualitative researchers. This foundational model consists of four iterative cycles: The Inspection Cycle, Coding Cycle, Categorisation Cycle, and Modelling Cycle, and memo-writing is inherent to the entire analysis process. Our goal is to offer a solid foundation from which novice qualitative researchers may begin familiarising themselves with the craft of qualitative research and continue discovering methods for making sense of qualitative data.",

Here we develop a simple theoretical model that links interspecific differences in metabolic traits, which capture the temperature-dependence of resource acquisition, to the outcome of pairwise competition in phytoplankton. We parameterised our model with metabolic traits derived from six species of freshwater phytoplankton and tested its ability to predict the outcome of competition in all pairwise combinations of the species in a factorial experiment, manipulating temperature and nutrient availability. The model correctly predicted the outcome of competition in 71% of the pairwise experiments. These results demonstrate that metabolic traits play a key role in determining how changes in temperature influence interspecific competition and lay the foundation for developing theory to predict the effects of warming in complex, multi-species communities.",

As a part of the spiritual values aimed at instructing human beings, mainly Muslims, tawakkul (trust in God) and tawhid (belief to God) are to be enhanced to situate the core religious foundation as the basic element for life at individual and social levels in the Muslim communities. This paper aims to critically examine tawakkul and tawhid to strengthening divine values as a foundation of self-regulation in religiosity.,This paper aims to critically examine tawakkul and tawhid to strengthening divine values as a foundation of self-regulation in religiosity. The literature review from referred journals was conducted using keywords on divine values, self-regulation in religiosity and tawakkul and tawhid. In order to obtain such literature, the critical analysis was conducted by organising substantive keywords. Then, extraction of data with deep literature analysis was carried out to interpret the findings. The key elements were analysed and synthesised into a new interpretation, conceptualisation and modelling of conceptualising tawakkul and tawhid concerns for sustainability of divine values for self-regulation in religiosity.,The finding reveals that the significance of conceptualising tawakkul and tawhid refers to as sustainability of divine involvement, as an emotionally religious commitment and as a consciously held religious discipline. Primarily, as the religious principle founded on a basic element transferred into individual and social levels, Islamic insights from tawakkul and tawhid offer valuable considerations for the understanding and amelioration of development by contributing a model that bases the “mental” and “spiritual” elements on a religious foundation, as an ultimate component for faith, a religious commitment and a belief in an authoritarian God to foster moral and spiritual qualities amidst the society.,Regulating tawakkul and tawhid to enhance dynamically constructive system for moral personality through critical examination as a foundation for religious-based self-regulation offers valuable considerations for the understanding and amelioration of development. Critical examination of tawakkul and tawhid as a foundation for religious self-regulation is considerably engaged to enhance the understanding and amelioration of development. It does so by contributing a model that bases mental and spiritual elements on a religious foundation, as an ultimate component for faith, religious commitment and belief in an authoritarian God to foster moral and spiritual qualities among human beings.",

This research uses a Huff-based model automated in a geographic information systems (GIS) environment to delineate HSAs. Based on the Florida State Inpatient Database (SID) in 2011, a best-fitting distance decay function is derived from the actual travel patterns of hospitalization and then fed into the Huff model to strengthen the model's theoretical foundation in individual spatial behavior. The HSAs derived from the Huff-based model are then compared to the traditional flow-based HSAs defined by the Dartmouth method and assessed in terms of self-containment and heterogeneity of internal socioeconomic structure and urbanicity. The Huff-based model requires fewer data and is easy to implement as an automated toolkit and thus has great potential for replication in other regions to define large-scale and consistent HSAs.",

        "title": "Wrinkle formation during steering in automated fiber placement: Modeling and experimental verification",
        "abstract": "Automated fiber placement is being widely applied in the aerospace industry due to its advantages. This technology has the capability to improve the efficiency of composite structures by steering where properties such as stiffness can vary within the same part. However, such steering is limited by process-induced defects such as out-of-plane wrinkles, which occur when the steering radius exceeds its critical limit. The present paper proposes a theoretical model for wrinkle formation during steering of the autoclave thermosetting prepreg. The Rayleigh–Ritz approach is used to model wrinkle formation based on the critical buckling load. The prepreg tape is considered an orthotropic plate resting on a Pasternak elastic foundation, which consists of one elastic spring layer connected to an elastic shear layer. Closed form solutions for predicting both critical steering radius and buckling wavelength is presented. The two foundation parameters and the required mechanical properties of the prepreg are experimentally characterized. The model-predicted results are validated by the experimental results. The results reveal good agreement between the predicted and experimental values. It is also found that a significant improvement in the model was achieved by adding the shear layer to the foundation.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a novel numerical procedure to predict nonlinear buckling and postbuckling stability of imperfect clamped–clamped single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) surrounded by nonlinear elastic foundation. Nanoscale effect of CNTs is included by using energy-equivalent model (EEM) which transferring the chemical energy between carbon atoms to mechanical strain energy. Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio for zigzag (n, 0), and armchair (n, n) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are presented as functions of orientation and force constants by using energy-equivalent model (EEM). Nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli assumptions are proposed considering mid-plane stretching to exhibit a large deformation and a small strain. To simulate the interaction of CNTs with the surrounding elastic medium, nonlinear elastic foundation with cubic nonlinearity and shearing layer are employed. The governing nonlinear integro-partial-differential equations are derived in terms of only the lateral displacement. The modified differential quadrature method (DQM) is exploited to obtain numerical results of the nonlinear governing equations. The static problem is solved for critical buckling loads and the postbuckling deformation as a function of applied axial load, curved amplitude, CNT length, and orientations. Numerical results show that the effects of chirality angle and curved amplitude on static response of armchair and zigzag CNTs are significant. This model is helpful especially in mechanical design of NEMS manufactured from CNTs.",

Drawing on insights from the literature on both prerecorded interlingual subtitling and simultaneous interpreting, the authors then introduce the NTR model, an NER-based formula for calculating the accuracy rate of (interlingual) live subtitles. The model features a set of categories for scoring the accuracy of content and form as well as a three-level grading scale for translation and recognition errors. The application of the NTR model is exemplified, highlighting the role of the accuracy rate as part of an overall qualitative assessment.",

In this study, we developed a new configuration of structural foundation using a three-dimensional (3D) periodic material for seismic isolation of critical infrastructure, particularly nuclear infrastructure. To this aim, we first performed analytical and finite element studies to compare two different types of 3D unit cells, i.e., Bragg Scattering and Locally resonant unit cells, to investigate their characteristics and applicability as a seismic isolator. We then designed a large scale test specimen based on the Bragg-scattering type unit cell using common construction materials: reinforced concrete blocks and polyurethane sheets. The designed test specimen was constructed and tested using a shake table subjected to different types of excitations in the horizontal and vertical directions as well as the torsional mode. The dynamic response of a small modular reactor (SMR) building model protected by the 3D periodic foundation demonstrates that 90% response reduction was achieved within the frequency band gaps. The response attenuation was achieved in all three tested directions. Moreover, the periodic foundation-isolated SMR building exhibited a stable response with negligible rocking on the structural system.",

The analysis procedure employs standard viscous‐damper absorbing boundaries to model the semi‐unbounded foundation and fluid domains and specifies the seismic input as effective earthquake forces—determined from a control motion defined at the foundation surface—at these boundaries. Presented in this paper are several simplifications to this direct FE method that greatly facilitates its implementation in commercial FE software. Also addressed is the modeling of the principal nonlinear mechanisms for concrete dams, calibration of damping in the numerical model to ensure consistency with values measured at actual dams, and practical procedures for implementation of the direct FE method with a commercial FE program.",

However, unlike some of those frameworks, it can be applied to large-scale models and real-world datasets.

In particular, AT can be quantified accurately in live zebrafish using fluorescent lipophilic dyes. Although this methodology offers considerable promise, the comprehensive identification and classification of zebrafish ATs has not been performed. Here, we use fluorescent lipophilic dyes and in vivo imaging systematically to identify, classify and quantify the zebrafish AT pool. We identify 34 regionally distinct zebrafish ATs, including five visceral ATs and 22 subcutaneous ATs. For each of these ATs, we describe detailed morphological characteristics to aid their identification in future studies. Furthermore, we quantify the areas for each AT and construct regression models to allow prediction of expected AT size and variation across a range of developmental stages. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this resource for identifying effects of strain variation and high-fat diet on AT growth. Altogether, this resource provides foundational information on the identity, dynamics and expected quantities of zebrafish ATs for use as a reference for future studies. Summary: A standardized nomenclature and classification system for zebrafish adipose tissues and regression models to predict expected adipose size during the course of zebrafish development.",

By contrast, models of issue-driven change propose that public opinion on cultural controversies lead people to revise their partisan and religious orientations. Using data from four panel studies covering the period 1992–2012, we pit the party- and religion-based theories of opinion change against the issue-based model of change. Consistent with the standard view, party and religion constrain culture war opinion. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, but consistent with our novel theory, opinions on culture war issues lead people to revise their partisan affinities and religious orientations.

Although well-calibrated p–y curves exist for non-liquefied soils (e.g. soft clay and sand), the profession still lacks reliable p–y curves for liquefied soils. In fact, the latter should be consistent with the observed strain-stiffening behaviour exhibited by liquefied samples in both element and physical model tests. It is recognised that this behaviour is induced by the tendency of the liquefied soil to dilate upon undrained shearing, which ultimately results in a gradual decrease in excess pore pressure, and consequent increase in stiffness and strength. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it proposes an easy-to-use empirical model for constructing stress–strain relationships for liquefied soils. This only requires three soil parameters which can conveniently be determined by means of laboratory tests. Seco...",

MCST is applied to this model to be productive in design and analysis of micro actuators and micro sensors. The modeled cylindrical FG microshell, its equations of motion and boundary conditions are derived by Hamilton’s principle and the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT). For the first time, in the present study, functionally graded length scale parameter which changes along the thickness has been considered in the temperature-dependent cylindrical FG microshell. The accuracy of the present model is verified with previous studies and also with those obtained by analytical Navier method. The novelty of the current study is consideration of viscoelastic foundation, various thermal loadings and size effect as well as satisfying various boundary conditions implemented on the temperature-dependent cylindrical FG microshell using MCST. Generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM) is applied to discretize the equations of motion. Then, some factors are investigated such as the influence of length to radius ratio, damping, Winkler and Pasternak foundations, different temperature changes, circumferential wave numbers, and boundary conditions on natural frequency of the cylindrical FG microshell. The results have many applications such as modeling of microrobots and biomedical microsystems.",

        "abstract": "In this study, free vibration behaviors of various embedded nanowires made of different materials are investigated by using Eringen’s nonlocal elasticity theory. Silicon carbide nanowire (SiCNW), silver nanowire (AgNW), and gold nanowire (AuNW) are modeled as Euler–Bernoulli nanobeams with various boundary conditions such as simply supported (S-S), clamped simply supported (C-S), clamped–clamped (C-C), and clamped-free (C-F). The interactions between nanowires and medium are simulated by the Winkler elastic foundation model. The Galerkin weighted residual method is applied to the governing equations to gain stiffness and mass matrices. The results are given by tables and graphs. The effects of small-scale parameters, boundary conditions, and foundation parameters on frequencies are examined in detail. In addition, the influence of temperature change on the vibrational responses of the nanowires are also pursued as a case study.",

        "abstract": "The paper presents a lumped parameter model for the approximation of the frequency‐dependent dynamic stiffness of pile group foundations. The model can be implemented in commercial software to perform linear or nonlinear dynamic analyses of structures founded on piles taking into account the frequency‐dependent coupled roto‐translational, vertical, and torsional behaviour of the soil‐foundation system. Closed‐form formulas for estimating parameters of the model are proposed with reference to pile groups embedded in homogeneous soil deposits. These are calibrated with a nonlinear least square procedure, based on data provided by an extensive non‐dimensional parametric analysis performed with a model previously developed by the authors. Pile groups with square layout and different number of piles embedded in soft and stiff soils are considered. Formulas are overall well capable to reproduce parameters of the proposed lumped system that can be straightforwardly incorporated into inertial structural analyses to account for the dynamic behaviour of the soil‐foundation system. Some applications on typical bridge piers are finally presented to show examples of practical use of the proposed model. Results demonstrate the capability of the proposed lumped system as well as the formulas efficiency in approximating impedances of pile groups and the relevant effect on the response of the superstructure.",

        "abstract": "The empower action model addresses childhood adversity as a root cause of disease by building resilience across multiple levels of influence to promote health, equity, and well-being. The model builds on the current evidence around adverse childhood experiences and merges important frameworks within key areas of public health—the socio-ecological model, protective factors, race equity and inclusion, and the life course perspective. The socio-ecological model is used as the foundation for this model to highlight the multilevel approach needed for improvement in public health. Five key principles that build on the protective factors literature are developed to be applied at each of the levels of the socio-ecological model: understanding, support, inclusion, connection, and growth. These principles are developed with actions that can be implemented across the life span. Finally, actions suggested with each principle are grounded in the tenets of race equity and inclusion, framing all actionable steps with an equity lens. This article discusses the process by which the model was developed and provides steps for states and communities to implement this tool. It also introduces efforts in a state to use this model within county coalitions through an innovative use of federal and foundation funding.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The current paradigm for causal inference in epidemiology relies primarily on the evaluation of counterfactual contrasts via statistical regression models informed by graphical causal models (often in the form of directed acyclic graphs, or DAGs) and their underlying mathematical theory. However, there have been growing calls for supplementary methods, and one such method that has been proposed is agent-based modelling due to its potential for simulating counterfactuals. However, within the epidemiological literature, there currently exists a general lack of clarity regarding what exactly agent-based modelling is (and is not) and, importantly, how it differs from microsimulation modelling—perhaps its closest methodological comparator. We clarify this distinction by briefly reviewing the history of each method, which provides a context for their similarities and differences, and casts light on the types of research questions that they have evolved (and thus are well suited) to answering; we do the same for DAG-informed regression methods. The distinct historical evolutions of DAG-informed regression modelling, microsimulation modelling and agent-based modelling have given rise to distinct features of the methods themselves, and provide a foundation for critical comparison. Not only are the three methods well suited to addressing different types of causal questions, but, in doing so, they place differing levels of emphasis on fixed and random effects, and also tend to operate on different timescales and in different timeframes.",

        "abstract": "Purpose. The purpose of this study is to trace the theoretical developments of the gravity model of trade. The key question is: what are the dominant features of the development of the gravity trade model?\n\nMethodology. This research is conducted by employing a number of methods\nthat include the historical, descriptive and analytical methods. The main contribution of this paper is to trace the historical and theoretical development phases of the gravity model.\n\nFindings. This study is a novel attempt in terms of the identification of the four distinctive phases of the development of the gravity model. This work would, therefore, expand the existing literature on the gravity model. We argue that the development of the gravity model is the\noutcome of many research efforts. A large body of literature has given the model a solid theoretical foundation. But there is no consensus about the proper econometric estimation methods of the model. The gravity model is significant both historically and analytically. It is a\nuseful tool for the analysis of international trade. It has become a popular research device used by the researchers and policy makers around\nthe world. The gravity is regarded as one of the most successful models\nin the literature of international economics.\n\nOriginality. The original contributions of this paper lie in streamlining the consistent historical development of the gravity model over a longer period of time-frame, ranging from 1885 to 2018.\n\nLimitations and Implications. This work is theoretical aspects of the trade gravity model. Future researchers could overcome the limitations by combining the theoretical and empirical studies in a paper. This paper can help the future researchers in dealing with the broad body of literature of gravity model.\n\nAcknowledement.

These structures should be designed in consideration of surface fault rupture hazards or strategies should be adopted to protect the structures from fault-induced damage. Geotechnical mitigation strategies such as diversion of the fault rupture away from the structure and diffusion of the rupture over a wide zone are possible strategies. The effectiveness of these geotechnical mitigation measures for reverse faulting on shallow embedded foundations was investigated using a series of centrifuge tests. These measures included excavation of a vertical trench adjacent to the foundation and installation of geogrid layers beneath the foundation. The trench was shown to be effective for a range of foundation positions depending on the magnitude of the fault offset, dip angle of the fault, depth of the trench, embedment depth of the foundation, and the number of trenches used. The geogrid layers prevented a distinct fault rupture from reaching the surface and spread fault displacement over a wider zone, but were unable to mitigate the surface fault rupture hazard for shallow embedded foundations.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe objective of this study was to describe the experience of a volunteering neurosurgeon during an 18-week stay at the Neurosurgery Education and Development (NED) Institute and to report the general situation regarding the development of neurosurgery in Zanzibar, identifying the challenges and opportunities and explaining the NED Foundation's model for safe practice and sustainability.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe NED Foundation deployed the volunteer neurosurgeon coordinator (NC) for an 18-week stay at the NED Institute at the Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Stonetown, Zanzibar. The main roles of the NC were as follows: management of patients, reinforcement of weekly academic activities, coordination of international surgical camps, and identification of opportunities for improvement. The improvement opportunities were categorized as clinical, administrative, and sociocultural and were based on observations made by the NC as well as on interviews with local doctors, administrators, and government officials.\n\n\nRESULTS\nDuring the 18-week period, the NC visited 460 patients and performed 85 surgical procedures. Four surgical camps were coordinated on-site. Academic activities were conducted weekly. The most significant challenges encountered were an intense workload, deficient infrastructure, lack of self-confidence among local physicians, deficiencies in technical support and repairs of broken equipment, and lack of guidelines. Through a series of interviews, the sociocultural factors influencing the NED Foundation's intervention were determined. Factors identified for success were the activity of neurosurgical societies in East Africa; structured pan-African neurosurgical training; the support of the Foundation for International Education in Neurological Surgery (FIENS) and the College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa (COSECSA); motivated personnel; and the Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar's willingness to collaborate with the NED Foundation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInternational collaboration programs should balance local challenges and opportunities in order to effectively promote the development of neurosurgery in East Africa. Support and endorsement should be sought to harness shared resources and experience. Determining the caregiving and educational objectives within the logistic, administrative, social, and cultural framework of the target hospital is paramount to success.",

        "abstract": "Adaptation of metamaterials at micro- to nanometer scales to metastructures at much larger scales offers a new alternative for seismic isolation systems. These new isolation systems, known as periodic foundations, function both as a structural foundation to support gravitational weight of the superstructure and also as a seismic isolator to isolate the superstructure from incoming seismic waves. Here we describe the application of periodic foundations for the seismic protection of nuclear power plants, in particular small modular reactors (SMR). For this purpose, a large-scale shake table test on a one-dimensional (1D) periodic foundation supporting an SMR building model was conducted. The 1D periodic foundation was designed and fabricated using reinforced concrete and synthetic rubber (polyurethane) materials. The 1D periodic foundation structural system was tested under various input waves, which include white noise, stepped sine and seismic waves in the horizontal and vertical directions as well as in the torsional mode. The shake table test results show that the 1D periodic foundation can reduce the acceleration response (transmissibility) of the SMR building up to 90%. In addition, the periodic foundation-isolated structure also exhibited smaller displacement than the non-isolated SMR building. This study indicates that the challenge faced in developing metastructures can be overcome and the periodic foundations can be applied to isolating vibration response of engineering structures.",

Load transfer from the existing foundation to the micropiles is an important mechanism to consider when designing an existing foundation underpinned by micropiles. However, this mechanism has not been well investigated or understood. This paper presents a numerical study on an existing foundation underpinned by micropiles using three-dimensional (3D) finite-difference software. Verification of the numerical model was first achieved by comparing the results of the numerical model to those obtained from the full-scale loading test. In this verification, the numerical model was used to simulate an existing footing initially constructed on a natural soil to support a structure and later subjected to additional loads under two different conditions.

It focuses on the interplay between different topics and persuasion efforts. We demonstrate that societal opinion polarization often arises as an unintended by-product of influencers attempting to promote a product or idea. We discuss a number of mechanisms for the emergence of polarization involving one or more influencers, sending messages strategically, heuristically, or randomly. We also examine some computational aspects of choosing the most effective means of influencing agents and the effects of those strategic considerations on polarization. Funding: J.

Logic examines what counts as good reasoning. The aim of the paper is to investigate the foundations of OR in terms of the relationship between logic and the activities and methods of OR inquiry. The approach taken is: (i) to identify the types of activities that OR practitioners typically engage in during an OR project; (ii) to introduce some of the main areas of logical reasoning, particularly those relevant to OR practice such as deductive, inductive, modal, and informal logic; and (iii) to bring these two lines of thinking together in order to examine the relationship between logic and OR practice and methods. The key finding is that although the core activities and methods of gathering data, analysing it and developing models are logically well founded, the management of uncertainty in the line of argument could benefit from the insights and methods provided by logic. From this analysis, some practical suggestions are made to improve the process of OR, the development of the line of argument, and the honing of advice given to clients.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Muscle strength is a key clinical parameter used to monitor the progression of human muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies. Although Caenorhabditis elegans is an established genetic model for studying the mechanisms and treatments of muscular dystrophies, analogous strength-based measurements in this disease model are lacking. Here, we describe the first demonstration of the direct measurement of muscular strength in dystrophin-deficient C. elegans mutants using a micropillar-based force measurement system called NemaFlex. We show that dys-1(eg33) mutants, but not dys-1(cx18) mutants, are significantly weaker than their wild-type counterparts in early adulthood, cannot thrash in liquid at wild-type rates, display mitochondrial network fragmentation in the body wall muscles, and have an abnormally high baseline mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, treatment with prednisone, the standard treatment for muscular dystrophy in humans, and melatonin both improve muscular strength, thrashing rate and mitochondrial network integrity in dys-1(eg33), and prednisone treatment also returns baseline respiration to normal levels. Thus, our results demonstrate that the dys-1(eg33) strain is more clinically relevant than dys-1(cx18) for muscular dystrophy studies in C. elegans. This finding, in combination with the novel NemaFlex platform, can be used as an efficient workflow for identifying candidate compounds that can improve strength in the C. elegans muscular dystrophy model. Our study also lays the foundation for further probing of the mechanism of muscle function loss in dystrophin-deficient C. elegans, leading to knowledge translatable to human muscular dystrophy. This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper. Editor's choice: Dystrophin-deficient Caenorhabditis elegans have measurably weak muscle strength and mitochondrial dysfunction, and they respond to drug treatments standard in treating human Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",

        "abstract": "The advancement in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has provided new opportunities for teaching and learning in the form of e-learning. However, developing specialized contents, accommodating profiles of learners, e-learning pedagogy and available ICT infrastructure are the real challenges that need to be properly addressed for any successful e-learning system. The adaptability in an e-learning system can be used to address many of these challenges and issues. This paper proposes a learner model for adaptable e-learning model. The proposed model is based on the findings of a survey conducted to investigate the profiles and preferences of the local learners. The conceptual framework highlights the layered model of adaptable e-learning with the knowledge level of learners as the foundation layer. The foundation layer is derived from four components of adaptable e-learning, i.e., domain, program pedagogy, student model and technology interface. The learner algorithm retrieves the adaptable contents from the domain model by analyzing the learner information stored in the student model. The e-assessment is part of the program pedagogy and the assessment results are used to control the presentation and navigation of adaptable contents during the learning process. The model has been tested on a Computer Science course offered by Allama Iqbal Open University, Islamabad, Pakistan at Post Graduate Diploma level. The results show that the proposed adaptable e-learning model has significantly improved the knowledge level of the learners.",

This language embeds a number of ontological patterns that reflect the micro-theories comprising a particular foundational ontology named UFO.

        "abstract": "Stellar distances constitute a foundational pillar of astrophysics. The publication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major contribution to this. Yet despite Gaia's precision, the majority of these stars are so distant or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large, thereby precluding a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here we take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a prior constructed from a three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model includes interstellar extinction and Gaia's variable magnitude limit. We infer two types of distance. The first, geometric, uses the parallax together with a direction-dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric, additionally uses the colour and apparent magnitude of a star, by exploiting the fact that stars of a given colour have a restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes (plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations show that the photogeometric estimates generally have higher accuracy and precision for stars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalogue of 1.47 billion geometric and 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty measures. Our estimates are quantiles of a posterior probability distribution, so they transform invariably and can therefore also be used directly in the distance modulus (5log10(r)-5). The catalogue may be downloaded or queried using ADQL at various sites (see this http URL) where it can also be cross-matched with the Gaia catalogue.",

        "title": "Shifting the limits in wheat research and breeding using a fully annotated reference genome",
        "abstract": "Insights from the annotated wheat genome Wheat is one of the major sources of food for much of the world. However, because bread wheat's genome is a large hybrid mix of three separate subgenomes, it has been difficult to produce a high-quality reference sequence. Using recent advances in sequencing, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium presents an annotated reference genome with a detailed analysis of gene content among subgenomes and the structural organization for all the chromosomes. Examples of quantitative trait mapping and CRISPR-based genome modification show the potential for using this genome in agricultural research and breeding. Ramírez-González et al. exploited the fruits of this endeavor to identify tissue-specific biased gene expression and coexpression networks during development and exposure to stress. These resources will accelerate our understanding of the genetic basis of bread wheat. Science, this issue p. eaar7191; see also p. eaar6089 The 21 annotated chromosomes of bread wheat provide a foundation for innovation in research and breeding. INTRODUCTION Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most widely cultivated crop on Earth, contributing about a fifth of the total calories consumed by humans. Consequently, wheat yields and production affect the global economy, and failed harvests can lead to social unrest. Breeders continuously strive to develop improved varieties by fine-tuning genetically complex yield and end-use quality parameters while maintaining stable yields and adapting the crop to regionally specific biotic and abiotic stresses. RATIONALE Breeding efforts are limited by insufficient knowledge and understanding of wheat biology and the molecular basis of central agronomic traits. To meet the demands of human population growth, there is an urgent need for wheat research and breeding to accelerate genetic gain as well as to increase and protect wheat yield and quality traits. In other plant and animal species, access to a fully annotated and ordered genome sequence, including regulatory sequences and genome-diversity information, has promoted the development of systematic and more time-efficient approaches for the selection and understanding of important traits. Wheat has lagged behind, primarily owing to the challenges of assembling a genome that is more than five times as large as the human genome, polyploid, and complex, containing more than 85% repetitive DNA. To provide a foundation for improvement through molecular breeding, in 2005, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium set out to deliver a high-quality annotated reference genome sequence of bread wheat. RESULTS An annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in the form of 21 chromosome-like sequence assemblies has now been delivered, giving access to 107,891 high-confidence genes, including their genomic context of regulatory sequences. This assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage–related gene coexpression networks using a transcriptome atlas representing all stages of wheat development. The dynamics of change in complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. Aspects of the future value of the annotated assembly for molecular breeding and research were exemplarily illustrated by resolving the genetic basis of a quantitative trait locus conferring resistance to abiotic stress and insect damage as well as by serving as the basis for genome editing of the flowering-time trait. CONCLUSION This annotated reference sequence of wheat is a resource that can now drive disruptive innovation in wheat improvement, as this community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding. Importantly, the bioinformatics capacity developed for model-organism genomes will facilitate a better understanding of the wheat genome as a result of the high-quality chromosome-based genome assembly. By necessity, breeders work with the genome at the whole chromosome level, as each new cross involves the modification of genome-wide gene networks that control the expression of complex traits such as yield. With the annotated and ordered reference genome sequence in place, researchers and breeders can now easily access sequence-level information to precisely define the necessary changes in the genomes for breeding programs. This will be realized through the implementation of new DNA marker platforms and targeted breeding technologies, including genome editing. Wheat genome deciphered, assembled, and ordered. Seeds, or grains, are what counts with respect to wheat yields (left panel), but all parts of the plant contribute to crop performance. With complete access to the ordered sequence of all 21 wheat chromosomes, the context of regulatory sequences, and the interaction network of expressed genes—all shown here as a circular plot (right panel) with concentric tracks for diverse aspects of wheat genome composition—breeders and researchers now have the ability to rewrite the story of wheat crop improvement. Details on value ranges underlying the concentric heatmaps of the right panel are provided in the full article online. An annotated reference sequence representing the hexaploid bread wheat genome in 21 pseudomolecules has been analyzed to identify the distribution and genomic context of coding and noncoding elements across the A, B, and D subgenomes. With an estimated coverage of 94% of the genome and containing 107,891 high-confidence gene models, this assembly enabled the discovery of tissue- and developmental stage–related coexpression networks by providing a transcriptome atlas representing major stages of wheat development. Dynamics of complex gene families involved in environmental adaptation and end-use quality were revealed at subgenome resolution and contextualized to known agronomic single-gene or quantitative trait loci. This community resource establishes the foundation for accelerating wheat research and application through improved understanding of wheat biology and genomics-assisted breeding.",

There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.",

The purpose of this paper is to shed light on several misconceptions that have emerged as a result of the proposed “new guidelines” for PLS-SEM. The authors discuss various aspects related to current debates on when or when not to use PLS-SEM, and which model evaluation metrics to apply. In addition, this paper summarizes several important methodological extensions of PLS-SEM researchers can use to improve the quality of their analyses, results and findings.The paper merges literature from various disciplines, including marketing, strategic management, information systems, accounting and statistics, to present a state-of-the-art review of PLS-SEM. Based on these findings, the paper offers a point of orientation on how to consider and apply these latest developments when executing or assessing PLS-SEM-based research.This paper offers guidance regarding situations that favor the use of PLS-SEM and discusses the need to consider certain model evaluation metrics. It also summarizes how to deal with endogeneity in PLS-SEM, and critically comments on the recent proposal to adjust PLS-SEM estimates to mimic common factor models that are the foundation of covariance-based SEM. Finally, this paper opposes characterizing common concepts and practices of PLS-SEM as “out-of-date” without providing well-substantiated alternatives and solutions.The paper paves the way for future discussions and suggests a way forward to reach consensus regarding situations that favor PLS-SEM use and its application.This paper offers guidance on how to consider the latest methodological developments when executing or assessing PLS-SEM-based research.This paper complements recently proposed “new guidelines” with the aim of offering a counter perspective on some strong claims made in the latest literature on PLS-SEM. It also clarifies some misconceptions regarding the application of PLS-SEM.",

They are the site of significant sociocultural and economic transformations across many domains, from health and relationships to entertainment and everyday finance. As relatively closed technical systems, apps pose new methodological challenges for sociocultural digital media research. This article describes a method, grounded in a combination of science and technology studies with cultural studies, through which researchers can perform a critical analysis of a given app. The method involves establishing an app’s environment of expected use by identifying and describing its vision, operating model and modes of governance. It then deploys a walkthrough technique to systematically and forensically step through the various stages of app registration and entry, everyday use and discontinuation of use. The walkthrough method establishes a foundational corpus of data upon which can be built a more detailed analysis of an app’s intended purpose, embedded cultural meanings and implied ideal users and uses. The walkthrough also serves as a foundation for further user-centred research that can identify how users resist these arrangements and appropriate app technology for their own purposes.",

        "abstract": "The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local receptive fields at each layer. A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the “Squeeze-and-Excitation” (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251 percent, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${\\sim }$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"shen-ieq1-2913372.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula>25 percent.

        "abstract": "A respectable amount of work dealing with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) clearly indicates a popularity of TAM in the field of technology acceptance in general. Nevertheless, there is still a gap in existing knowledge regarding representative academic literature that underlie research on TAM in educational context. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide an overview of the current state of research efforts on TAM application in the field of learning and teaching for a variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. Through systematic search by the use of EBSCO Discovery Service, the review has identified 71 relevant studies ranged between 2003 and 2018. The main findings indicate that TAM and its many different versions represent a credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse learning technologies. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors affecting acceptance of learning with technology. The paper identifies some gaps in current work and suggests areas for further investigation. The results of this systematic review provide a better understanding of TAM acceptance studies in educational context and create a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known about this topic Technology acceptance research in teaching and learning context has become an attractive trend.A number of reviews and meta‐analysis focused on specific topics related to technology acceptance in education have been conducted.The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the key model in understanding predictors of human behaviour towards potential acceptance or rejection of the technology.What this paper adds The state of current research on Technology Acceptance Model application in educational context lacks comprehensive reviews addressing variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users.The paper presents systematic review of relevant academic literature on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the field of learning and teaching.The paper provides empirical evidence on the predictive validity of the models based on TAM presented in selected literature.The findings revealed that TAM, along with its many different versions called TAM++, is a leading scientific paradigm and credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse technological deployments in educational context.TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors that have affected acceptance of learning with technology.Implications for practice and/or policy The systematic review adds to the body of knowledge and creates a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field.By following the most common research objectives and/or by filling current gaps in applied research methods, chosen sample groups and types of result analysis, an own study could be conducted.Future research may well focus on identifying additional external factors that could further explain acceptance and usage of various learning technologies.

        "abstract": "We seek to guide operations management (OM) research on the implementation of supply chain traceability systems by identifying business requirements and the factors critical to successful implementation. We first motivate the need for implementing traceability systems in two very different industries—cobalt mining and pharmaceuticals—and present business requirements and critical success factors for implementation. Next, we describe how we carried out thematic analysis of practitioner and scholarly articles on implementing blockchain for supply chain traceability. Finally, we present our results pertaining to the needs of different stakeholders such as suppliers, consumers, and regulators. The business requirements for traceability systems are curbing illegal practices; improving sustainability performance; increasing operational efficiency; enhancing supply‐chain coordination; and sensing market trends. Critical success factors for implementation are companies’ capabilities; collaboration; technology maturity; supply chain practices; leadership; and governance of the traceability efforts. These findings provide a nascent measurement model for empirical work and a foundation for descriptive and normative research on blockchain applications for supply chain traceability.",

        "title": "The Supply Chain Has No Clothes: Technology Adoption of Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency",
        "abstract": "Blockchain technology, popularized by Bitcoin cryptocurrency, is characterized as an open-source, decentralized, distributed database for storing transaction information. Rather than relying on centralized intermediaries (e.g., banks) this technology allows two parties to transact directly using duplicate, linked ledgers called blockchains. This makes transactions considerably more transparent than those provided by centralized systems. As a result, transactions are executed without relying on explicit trust [of a third party], but on the distributed trust based on the consensus of the network (i.e., other blockchain users). Applying this technology to improve supply chain transparency has many possibilities. Every product has a long and storied history. However, much of this history is presently obscured. Often, when negative practices are exposed, they quickly escalate to scandalous, and financially crippling proportions. There are many recent examples, such as the exposure of child labor upstream in the manufacturing process and the unethical use of rainforest resources. Blockchain may bring supply chain transparency to a new level, but presently academic and managerial adoption of blockchain technologies is limited by our understanding. To address this issue, this research uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the concept of technology innovation adoption as a foundational framework for supply chain traceability. A conceptual model is developed and the research culminates with supply chain implications of blockchain that are inspired by theory and literature review.",

        "title": "Challenges and Opportunities with Big Data",
        "abstract": "- Data is exploding at a rapid rate. Big data is the term for data sets so large and complicated that it becomes difficult to process using traditional data management tools or processing applications. Heterogeneity, scale, timeliness, complexity, and privacy problems with Big Data impede progress at all phases of the pipeline that can create value from data. The problems start right away during data acquisition, when the data tsunami requires us to make decisions, currently in an ad hoc manner, about what data to keep and what to discard, and how to store what we keep reliably with the right metadata. Much data today is not natively in structured format, tweets and blogs are weakly structured pieces of text, while images and video are structured for storage and display, but not for semantic content and search. Transforming such content into a structured format for later analysis is a major challenge. The value of data explodes when it can be linked with other data, thus data integration is a major creator of value. Since most data is directly generated in digital format today, we have the opportunity and the challenge both to influence the creation to facilitate later linkage and to automatically link previously created data. Data analysis, organization, retrieval, and modeling are other foundational challenges. Data analysis is a clear bottleneck in many applications, both due to lack of scalability of the underlying algorithms and due to the complexity of the data that needs to be analyzed. Finally, presentation of the results and its interpretation by non-technical domain experts is crucial to extracting actionable knowledge.",

        "abstract": "Land use/land cover (LULC) maps are foundational geospatial data products needed by analysts and decision makers across governments, civil society, industry, and finance to monitor global environmental change and measure risk to sustainable livelihoods and development. There is a strong need for high-level, automated geospatial analysis products that turn these pixels into actionable insights for non-geospatial experts. The Sentinel 2 satellites, first launched in mid-2015, are excellent candidates for LULC mapping due to their high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution. Advances in deep learning and scalable cloud-based compute now provide the analysis capability required to unlock the value in global satellite imagery observations. Based on a novel, very large dataset of over 5 billion human-labeled Sentinel-2 pixels, we developed and deployed a deep learning segmentation model on Sentinel-2 data to create a global LULC map at 10m resolution that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and enables automated LULC mapping from time series observations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Rheumatic heart disease remains an important preventable cause of cardiovascular death and disability, particularly in low‐income and middle‐income countries. We estimated global, regional, and national trends in the prevalence of and mortality due to rheumatic heart disease as part of the 2015 Global Burden of Disease study. METHODS We systematically reviewed data on fatal and nonfatal rheumatic heart disease for the period from 1990 through 2015. Two Global Burden of Disease analytic tools, the Cause of Death Ensemble model and DisMod‐MR 2.1, were used to produce estimates of mortality and prevalence, including estimates of uncertainty. RESULTS We estimated that there were 319,400 (95% uncertainty interval, 297,300 to 337,300) deaths due to rheumatic heart disease in 2015. Global age‐standardized mortality due to rheumatic heart disease decreased by 47.8% (95% uncertainty interval, 44.7 to 50.9) from 1990 to 2015, but large differences were observed across regions. In 2015, the highest age‐standardized mortality due to and prevalence of rheumatic heart disease were observed in Oceania, South Asia, and central sub‐Saharan Africa. We estimated that in 2015 there were 33.4 million (95% uncertainty interval, 29.7 million to 43.1 million) cases of rheumatic heart disease and 10.5 million (95% uncertainty interval, 9.6 million to 11.5 million) disability‐adjusted life‐years due to rheumatic heart disease globally. CONCLUSIONS We estimated the global disease prevalence of and mortality due to rheumatic heart disease over a 25‐year period. The health‐related burden of rheumatic heart disease has declined worldwide, but high rates of disease persist in some of the poorest regions in the world.

        "abstract": "It is well known that urbanization and industrialization have resulted in the rapidly increasing emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are a major contributor to the formation of secondary pollutants (e.g., tropospheric ozone, PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate), and secondary organic aerosols) and photochemical smog. The emission of these pollutants has led to a large decline in air quality in numerous regions around the world, which has ultimately led to concerns regarding their impact on human health and general well-being. Catalytic oxidation is regarded as one of the most promising strategies for VOC removal from industrial waste streams. This Review systematically documents the progresses and developments made in the understanding and design of heterogeneous catalysts for VOC oxidation over the past two decades. It addresses in detail how catalytic performance is often drastically affected by the pollutant sources and reaction conditions. It also highlights the primary routes for catalyst deactivation and discusses protocols for their subsequent reactivation. Kinetic models and proposed oxidation mechanisms for representative VOCs are also provided. Typical catalytic reactors and oxidizers for industrial VOC destruction are further discussed. We believe that this Review will provide a great foundation and reference point for future design and development in this field.",

        "abstract": "The digital economy is growing fast, especially in developing countries. Yet the meaning and metrics of the digital economy are both limited and divergent. The aim of this paper is to review what is currently known in order to develop a definition of the digital economy, and an estimate of its size. The paper argues there are three scopes of relevance. The core of the digital economy is the ‘digital sector’: the IT/ICT sector producing foundational digital goods and services. The true ‘digital economy’ - defined as “that part of economic output derived solely or primarily from digital technologies with a business model based on digital goods or services” - consists of the digital sector plus emerging digital and platform services. The widest scope - use of ICTs in all economic fields - is here referred to as the ‘digitalised economy’. Following a review of measurement challenges, the paper estimates the digital economy as defined here to make up around 5% of global GDP and 3% of global employment. Behind this lies significant unevenness: the global North has had the lion’s share of the digital economy to date, but growth rates are fastest in the global South. Yet potential growth could be much higher: further research to understand more about the barriers to and impacts of the digital economy in developing countries is therefore a priority.",

These questions are awkward because they are difficult to answer with precision or certainty. ‘The professions’ have been an object of study by sociologists for many decades, but only one author has meaningfully ventured into the information professions. The System of Professions is now somewhat elderly, but the foundational theory developed here is very well-suited to a field like Information – weakly delineated and continually evolving. The purpose of this review is to explore whether this classic sociological work, following its thirtieth birthday, might have new relevance to students and practitioners of both traditional and emerging information professions, given their rapidly changing work environments. Andrew Abbott is a professor of Sociology at the University of Chicago, and he served as the long-time editor of the American Journal of Sociology (2000–2016). This was his first book, notably winning the prestigious American Sociology Association’s Distinguished Scholarly Book Award (1991). Abbott’s own doctoral research had focused on the emergence of psychiatry as a profession; it was from this work that he abstracted his general conceptual model of professions as a ‘survival-of-thefittest’ ecology, and one that is set in a frequently changing social, epistemological, and technical landscape. Abbott’s distinctive contribution to the discourse is to methodically define professions wholly in terms of an elbows-out application of expertise; professions compete with each other for expertise-based jurisdiction over solvable problems.

This paper contributes to filling this gap by addressing how the Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing (CC) and predictive analytics (PA) facilitate service transformation in industrial companies. Through the Data–Information–Knowledge–Wisdom (DIKW) model, we discuss how the abovementioned technologies transform low-level entities such as data into information and knowledge to support the service transformation of manufacturers. We propose a set of digital capabilities, based on the extant literature and the findings from four case studies. Then, we discuss how these capabilities support the service transformation trajectories of manufacturers. We find that IoT is foundational to any service transformation, although it is mostly needed to become an availability provider. PA is essential for moving to the performance provider profile. Besides providing scalability in all profiles, CC is specifically used to implement an industrialiser strategy, therefore leading to standardised, repeatable and productised offerings.",

        "abstract": "Decades of research document individual differences in prosocial behavior using controlled experiments that model social interactions in situations of interdependence. However, theoretical and empirical integration of the vast literature on the predictive validity of personality traits to account for these individual differences is missing. Here, we present a theoretical framework that identifies 4 broad situational affordances across interdependent situations (i.e., exploitation, reciprocity, temporal conflict, and dependence under uncertainty) and more specific subaffordances within certain types of interdependent situations (e.g., possibility to increase equality in outcomes) that can determine when, which, and how personality traits should be expressed in prosocial behavior. To test this framework, we meta-analyzed 770 studies reporting on 3,523 effects of 8 broad and 43 narrow personality traits on prosocial behavior in interdependent situations modeled in 6 commonly studied economic games (Dictator Game, Ultimatum Game, Trust Game, Prisoner's Dilemma, Public Goods Game, and Commons Dilemma). Overall, meta-analytic correlations ranged between -.18 ≤ ρ̂ ≤ .26, and most traits yielding a significant relation to prosocial behavior had conceptual links to the affordances provided in interdependent situations, most prominently the possibility for exploitation. Moreover, for several traits, correlations within games followed the predicted pattern derived from a theoretical analysis of affordances. On the level of traits, we found that narrow and broad traits alike can account for prosocial behavior, informing the bandwidth-fidelity problem. In sum, the meta-analysis provides a theoretical foundation that can guide future research on prosocial behavior and advance our understanding of individual differences in human prosociality.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are an indispensable machine learning tool despite the difficulty of diagnosing what aspects of a model’s input drive its decisions. In countless real-world domains, from legislation and law enforcement to healthcare, such diagnosis is essential to ensure that DNN decisions are driven by aspects appropriate in the context of its use. The development of methods and studies enabling the explanation of a DNN’s decisions has thus blossomed into an active and broad area of research. The field’s complexity is exacerbated by competing definitions of what it means “to explain” the actions of a DNN and to evaluate an approach’s “ability to explain”. This article offers a field guide to explore the space of explainable deep learning for those in the AI/ML field who are uninitiated. The field guide: i) Introduces three simple dimensions defining the space of foundational methods that contribute to explainable deep learning, ii) discusses the evaluations for model explanations, iii) places explainability in the context of other related deep learning research areas, and iv) discusses user-oriented explanation design and future directions.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although the current obesity epidemic has been well documented in children and adults, less is known about long‐term risks of adult obesity for a given child at his or her present age and weight. We developed a simulation model to estimate the risk of adult obesity at the age of 35 years for the current population of children in the United States. METHODS We pooled height and weight data from five nationally representative longitudinal studies totaling 176,720 observations from 41,567 children and adults. We simulated growth trajectories across the life course and adjusted for secular trends. We created 1000 virtual populations of 1 million children through the age of 19 years that were representative of the 2016 population of the United States and projected their trajectories in height and weight up to the age of 35 years. Severe obesity was defined as a body‐mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 35 or higher in adults and 120% or more of the 95th percentile in children. RESULTS Given the current level of childhood obesity, the models predicted that a majority of today's children (57.3%; 95% uncertainly interval [UI], 55.2 to 60.0) will be obese at the age of 35 years, and roughly half of the projected prevalence will occur during childhood. Our simulations indicated that the relative risk of adult obesity increased with age and BMI, from 1.17 (95% UI, 1.09 to 1.29) for overweight 2‐year‐olds to 3.10 (95% UI, 2.43 to 3.65) for 19‐year‐olds with severe obesity. For children with severe obesity, the chance they will no longer be obese at the age of 35 years fell from 21.0% (95% UI, 7.3 to 47.3) at the age of 2 years to 6.1% (95% UI, 2.1 to 9.9) at the age of 19 years. CONCLUSIONS On the basis of our simulation models, childhood obesity and overweight will continue to be a major health problem in the United States. Early development of obesity predicted obesity in adulthood, especially for children who were severely obese. (Funded by the JPB Foundation and others.)",

Recent years have witnessed promising progress for deep learning in DTI predictions. However, the following challenges are still open: (i) existing molecular representation learning approaches ignore the sub-structural nature of DTI, thus produce results that are less accurate and difficult to explain and (ii) existing methods focus on limited labeled data while ignoring the value of massive unlabeled molecular data. Results We propose a Molecular Interaction Transformer (MolTrans) to address these limitations via: (i) knowledge inspired sub-structural pattern mining algorithm and interaction modeling module for more accurate and interpretable DTI prediction and (ii) an augmented transformer encoder to better extract and capture the semantic relations among sub-structures extracted from massive unlabeled biomedical data. We evaluate MolTrans on real-world data and show it improved DTI prediction performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

        "abstract": "Organoids that self-organize into tissue-like structures have transformed our ability to model human development and disease. To date, all major organs can be mimicked using self-organizing organoids with the notable exception of the human heart. Here, we established self-organizing cardioids from human pluripotent stem cells that intrinsically specify, pattern and morph into chamber-like structures containing a cavity. Cardioid complexity can be controlled by signaling that instructs the separation of cardiomyocyte and endothelial layers, and by directing epicardial spreading, inward migration and differentiation. We find that cavity morphogenesis is governed by a mesodermal WNT-BMP signaling axis and requires its target HAND1, a transcription factor linked to human heart chamber cavity defects. In parallel, a WNT-VEGF axis coordinates myocardial self-organization with endothelial patterning and specification. Human cardioids represent a powerful platform to mechanistically dissect self-organization and congenital heart defects, serving as a foundation for future translational research. Highlights - Cardioids form cardiac-like chambers with inner endothelial lining and interact with epicardium - Cardioid self-organization and lineage complexity can be controlled by signaling - WNT-BMP signaling directs cavity formation in self-organized cardioids via HAND1 - WNT-VEGF coordinate endothelial patterning with myocardial cavity morphogenesis",

Combining learning with particle-based systems brings in two major benefits: first, the learned simulator, just like other particle-based systems, acts widely on objects of different materials; second, the particle-based representation poses strong inductive bias for learning: particles of the same type have the same dynamics within. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new environments of unknown dynamics within a few observations. We demonstrate robots achieving complex manipulation tasks using the learned simulator, such as manipulating fluids and deformable foam, with experiments both in simulation and in the real world. Our study helps lay the foundation for robot learning of dynamic scenes with particle-based representations.",

        "abstract": "Stomatal responses to humidity, soil moisture and other factors that influence plant water status are critical drivers of photosynthesis, productivity, water yield, ecohydrology and climate forcing, yet we still lack a thorough mechanistic understanding of these responses. Here I review historical and recent advances in stomatal water relations. Clear evidence now implicates a metabolically mediated response to leaf water status ('hydroactive feedback') in stomatal responses to evaporative demand and soil drought, possibly involving abscisic acid production in leaves. Other hypothetical mechanisms involving vapor and heat transport within leaves may contribute to humidity, light and temperature responses, but require further theoretical clarification and experimental validation. Variation and dynamics in hydraulic conductance, particularly within leaves, may contribute to water status responses. Continuing research to fully resolve mechanisms of stomatal responses to water status should focus on several areas: validating and quantifying the mechanism of leaf-based hydroactive feedback, identifying where in leaves water status is actively sensed, clarifying the role of leaf vapor and energy transport in humidity and temperature responses, and verifying foundational but minimally replicated results of stomatal hydromechanics across species. Clarity on these matters promises to deliver modelers with a tractable and reliable mechanistic model of stomatal responses to water status.",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT It is a refreshingly simple thought that migration is the combined result of two factors: the aspiration to migrate and the ability to migrate. Without having to resort to overly structural or individualistic explanations, this analytical distinction helps disentangle complex questions around why some people migrate but others do not. Still, aspiration and ability raise their own thorny theoretical and methodological questions. To begin with, what does it mean to have migration aspirations? How can such concepts be objects of empirical research? And is it meaningful to say that individuals possess the ability to migrate if their preference is to stay? The aspiration/ability model was originally proposed in this journal and has since been diversely applied and adapted. In this article, we look back at more than a decade of research to examine a series of theoretical and empirical developments related to the aspiration/ability model and its extensions. We identify two-step approaches as a class of analytical frameworks that share the basic logic of the aspiration/ability model. Covering expansive theoretical, methodological and empirical ground, we seek to lay a foundation for new research on global migration in its diverse forms.

        "abstract": "Researchers have proposed a wide variety of model explanation approaches, but it remains unclear how most methods are related or when one method is preferable to another. We establish a new class of methods, removal-based explanations, that are based on the principle of simulating feature removal to quantify each feature's influence. These methods vary in several respects, so we develop a framework that characterizes each method along three dimensions: 1) how the method removes features, 2) what model behavior the method explains, and 3) how the method summarizes each feature's influence. Our framework unifies 25 existing methods, including several of the most widely used approaches (SHAP, LIME, Meaningful Perturbations, permutation tests). This new class of explanation methods has rich connections that we examine using tools that have been largely overlooked by the explainability literature. To anchor removal-based explanations in cognitive psychology, we show that feature removal is a simple application of subtractive counterfactual reasoning. Ideas from cooperative game theory shed light on the relationships and trade-offs among different methods, and we derive conditions under which all removal-based explanations have information-theoretic interpretations. Through this analysis, we develop a unified framework that helps practitioners better understand model explanation tools, and that offers a strong theoretical foundation upon which future explainability research can build.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Information communication technology (ICT) is becoming increasingly important in our daily lives and in our educational system. There is a growing demand on educational institutions to use ICT to teach the skills and knowledge students need for the digital age. The adoption and integration of ICT into teaching and learning environment provides more opportunities for teachers and students to work better in a globalised digital age. ICT has the potential to play an increasingly important role in education be it in classroom, administration and online instruction or other activities. There is tremendous potential for teachers and students to harness the power of ICT to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that may influence teachers’ decision to adopt and integrate ICT in teaching and learning process. The study is chosen because of the strategic importance of ICT in education in general and particularly, its great potential, to transform the ways in which teaching is carried out in the classroom. It provides opportunities for greater flexibility, interactivity and accessibility for engaging teaching and learning at the individual, group and societal levels. There are a lot of studies in the area, but very little empirical research has been conducted to examine this phenomenon from the teachers perceptive. In order to achieve the study objectives, in-depth case studies, conceptualised within the grounded theory method will be used to generate thick description and explanation of the phenomenon. The diffusion theory and the technology acceptance model will provide the theoretical foundation for this study.",

        "abstract": "Abstract SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus with a linear single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, whose outbreak caused the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The ability of coronaviruses to rapidly evolve, adapt, and cross species barriers makes the development of effective and durable therapeutic strategies a challenging and urgent need. As for other RNA viruses, genomic RNA structures are expected to play crucial roles in several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle. Despite this, only a handful of functionally-conserved coronavirus structural RNA elements have been identified to date. Here, we performed RNA structure probing to obtain single-base resolution secondary structure maps of the full SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus genome both in vitro and in living infected cells. Probing data recapitulate the previously described coronavirus RNA elements (5′ UTR and s2m), and reveal new structures. Of these, ∼10.2% show significant covariation among SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, hinting at their functionally-conserved role. Secondary structure-restrained 3D modeling of these segments further allowed for the identification of putative druggable pockets. In addition, we identify a set of single-stranded segments in vivo, showing high sequence conservation, suitable for the development of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics. Collectively, our work lays the foundation for the development of innovative RNA-targeted therapeutic strategies to fight SARS-related infections.",

        "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm focusing on the connection of devices, objects, or “things” to each other, to the Internet, and to users. IoT technology is anticipated to become an essential requirement in the development of smart homes, as it offers convenience and efficiency to home residents so that they can achieve better quality of life. Application of the IoT model to smart homes, by connecting objects to the Internet, poses new security and privacy challenges in terms of the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the data sensed, collected, and exchanged by the IoT objects. These challenges make smart homes extremely vulnerable to different types of security attacks, resulting in IoT-based smart homes being insecure. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the possible security risks to develop a complete picture of the security status of smart homes. This article applies the operationally critical threat, asset, and vulnerability evaluation (OCTAVE) methodology, known as OCTAVE Allegro, to assess the security risks of smart homes. The OCTAVE Allegro method focuses on information assets and considers different information containers such as databases, physical papers, and humans. The key goals of this study are to highlight the various security vulnerabilities of IoT-based smart homes, to present the risks on home inhabitants, and to propose approaches to mitigating the identified risks. The research findings can be used as a foundation for improving the security requirements of IoT-based smart homes.",

        "title": "Three Concerns With Applying a Bifactor Model as a Structure of Psychopathology",
        "abstract": "Recently, bifactor modeling applications in clinical measurement have proliferated (e.g., Caspi et al., 2014; Lahey et al., 2012; Simms, Grös, Watson, & O’Hara, 2008; Vanheule, Desmet, Groenvynck, Rosseel, & Fontaine, 2008). It is critical, however, to distinguish between two types of applications. The first focuses on using the bifactor model as a tool for understanding the psychometrics of an assessment scale (see Rodriguez, Reise, & Haviland, 2016a, 2016b). This type has proven invaluable for informing the degree to which a measure yields an univocal total score (Reise, Moore, & Haviland, 2010) and, relatedly, the extent to which subscales representing theoretically distinct constructs (i.e., group factors) yield reliable scores after accounting for the general factor (Reise, Bonifay, & Haviland, 2013). The second is far more ambitious and leverages a bifactor model to represent the general and group factor structure of an entire domain of psychological functioning. This is the type in question in the target article ( Snyder, Young, & Hankin, 2016, this issue), wherein correlations among psychopathology items are modeled as reflecting a single psychopathology dimension, p, as well as orthogonal internalizing/externalizing group factors. In this and related studies, it is the structure, rather than the psychometric properties, that is of paramount theoretical interest. We raise three issues with bifactor modeling as it is applied to the “structure of psychopathology”— interpretability, model fit, and validation—and we point to recent psychometric tools for bifactor model evaluation. In the initial development of the bifactor method, Holzinger and Swineford (1937) stated that group factors are derived from the residual correlations that remain after extracting the general factor. Although estimation methods have changed radically since 1937, interpretation of group factors that are orthogonal to a general factor remains challenging. In certain applications (e.g., Cho, Cohen, & Kim, 2014), group factors are not viewed as meaningful subconstructs of a test but rather as methodological “nuisances” that impede measurement of the primary construct of interest. Assuming, however, that group factors are meaningful, how should they be interpreted? They must be construed as substantively unique, measuring subconstructs exclusive to the general factor. Snyder et al. (2016, this issue) and others conclude that the structure of psychopathology includes internalizing/ externalizing group factors; it is unclear whether, or to what degree, these factors can be interpreted as traits orthogonal to the p factor. It may also be difficult to interpret the general dimension in a bifactor model. Previous research has noted that a positive manifold does not imply a single general causal structure (e.g., a single neuropsychobiological structure that causes variation across content-diverse indicators; van der Maas et al., 2006). Although strong correlations among measures may suggest a bifactor structure, that does not imply that such a structure exists at the genotypic level (e.g., Cohen, Cohen, Teresi, Marchi, & Velez, 1990). Thus, it could be that the internalizing/ externalizing factors identified by Snyder et al. (2016, this issue) are interpreted correctly but that the emergence of a general p factor, rather than being generated by a single general latent trait, is the result of some different process altogether. Researchers must carefully investigate such issues before considering the bifactor model seriously as a foundational structure for clinical research. Of particular concern is the bifactor model’s tendency to show superior goodness of fit in model comparison studies. In Snyder et al. (2016, this issue), the bifactor structure outperformed both the unidimensional and the two (correlated) factor alternatives regarding goodness of fit and was thereby selected as the best representation of psychopathology. However, the superior performance of the bifactor model may be a symptom of “overfitting”— that is, modeling not only the important trends in the 657069 CPXXXX10.1177/2167702616657069Bonifay et al.Bifactor Model as a Structure of Psychopathology research-article2016",

        "abstract": "Deep learning's great success motivates many practitioners and students to learn about this exciting technology. However, it is often challenging for beginners to take their first step due to the complexity of understanding and applying deep learning. We present CNN Explainer, an interactive visualization tool designed for non-experts to learn and examine convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a foundational deep learning model architecture. Our tool addresses key challenges that novices face while learning about CNNs, which we identify from interviews with instructors and a survey with past students. CNN Explainer tightly integrates a model overview that summarizes a CNN's structure, and on-demand, dynamic visual explanation views that help users understand the underlying components of CNNs. Through smooth transitions across levels of abstraction, our tool enables users to inspect the interplay between low-level mathematical operations and high-level model structures. A qualitative user study shows that CNN Explainer helps users more easily understand the inner workings of CNNs, and is engaging and enjoyable to use. We also derive design lessons from our study. Developed using modern web technologies, CNN Explainer runs locally in users' web browsers without the need for installation or specialized hardware, broadening the public's education access to modern deep learning techniques.",

Key research priorities include: 1, new image reconstruction methods that efficiently produce images suitable for human interpretation from source data; 2, automated image labeling and annotation methods, including information extraction from the imaging report, electronic phenotyping, and prospective structured image reporting; 3, new machine learning methods for clinical imaging data, such as tailored, pretrained model architectures, and federated machine learning methods; 4, machine learning methods that can explain the advice they provide to human users (so-called explainable artificial intelligence); and 5, validated methods for image de-identification and data sharing to facilitate wide availability of clinical imaging data sets.

However, there is still lack of studies on effectively quantifying the lung infection caused by COVID-19. As a basic but challenging task of the diagnostic framework, segmentation plays a crucial role in accurate quantification of COVID-19 infection measured by computed tomography (CT) images. To this end, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm for automated segmentation of multiple COVID-19 infection regions. Specifically, we use the Aggregated Residual Transformations to learn a robust and expressive feature representation and apply the soft attention mechanism to improve the capability of the model to distinguish a variety of symptoms of the COVID-19. With a public CT image dataset, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in comparison with other competing methods. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our algorithm for automated segmentation of COVID-19 Chest CT images.

        "title": "The third realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame by very long baseline interferometry",
        "abstract": "A new realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) is presented based on the work achieved by a working group of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) mandated for this purpose. This new realization follows the initial realization of the ICRF completed in 1997 and its successor, ICRF2, adopted as a replacement in 2009. The new frame, referred to as ICRF3, is based on nearly 40 years of data acquired by very long baseline interferometry at the standard geodetic and astrometric radio frequencies (8.4 and 2.3 GHz), supplemented with data collected at higher radio frequencies (24 GHz and dual-frequency 32 and 8.4 GHz) over the past 15 years. State-of-the-art astronomical and geophysical modeling has been used to analyze these data and derive source positions. The modeling integrates, for the first time, the effect of the galactocentric acceleration of the solar system (directly estimated from the data) which, if not considered, induces significant deformation of the frame due to the data span. The new frame includes positions at 8.4 GHz for 4536 extragalactic sources. Of these, 303 sources, uniformly distributed on the sky, are identified as “defining sources” and as such serve to define the axes of the frame. Positions at 8.4 GHz are supplemented with positions at 24 GHz for 824 sources and at 32 GHz for 678 sources. In all, ICRF3 comprises 4588 sources, with three-frequency positions available for 600 of these. Source positions have been determined independently at each of the frequencies in order to preserve the underlying astrophysical content behind such positions. They are reported for epoch 2015.0 and must be propagated for observations at other epochs for the most accurate needs, accounting for the acceleration toward the Galactic center, which results in a dipolar proper motion field of amplitude 0.0058 milliarcsecond yr−1 (mas yr−1). The frame is aligned onto the International Celestial Reference System to within the accuracy of ICRF2 and shows a median positional uncertainty of about 0.1 mas in right ascension and 0.2 mas in declination, with a noise floor of 0.03 mas in the individual source coordinates. A subset of 500 sources is found to have extremely accurate positions, in the range of 0.03–0.06 mas, at the traditional 8.4 GHz frequency. Comparing ICRF3 with the recently released Gaia Celestial Reference Frame 2 in the optical domain, there is no evidence for deformations larger than 0.03 mas between the two frames, in agreement with the ICRF3 noise level. Significant positional offsets between the three ICRF3 frequencies are detected for about 5% of the sources. Moreover, a notable fraction (22%) of the sources shows optical and radio positions that are significantly offset. There are indications that these positional offsets may be the manifestation of extended source structures. This third realization of the ICRF was adopted by the IAU at its 30th General Assembly in August 2018 and replaced the previous realization, ICRF2, on January 1, 2019.",

        "abstract": "Abstract The Neotoma Paleoecology Database is a community-curated data resource that supports interdisciplinary global change research by enabling broad-scale studies of taxon and community diversity, distributions, and dynamics during the large environmental changes of the past. By consolidating many kinds of data into a common repository, Neotoma lowers costs of paleodata management, makes paleoecological data openly available, and offers a high-quality, curated resource. Neotoma’s distributed scientific governance model is flexible and scalable, with many open pathways for participation by new members, data contributors, stewards, and research communities. The Neotoma data model supports, or can be extended to support, any kind of paleoecological or paleoenvironmental data from sedimentary archives. Data additions to Neotoma are growing and now include >3.8 million observations, >17,000 datasets, and >9200 sites. Dataset types currently include fossil pollen, vertebrates, diatoms, ostracodes, macroinvertebrates, plant macrofossils, insects, testate amoebae, geochronological data, and the recently added organic biomarkers, stable isotopes, and specimen-level data. Multiple avenues exist to obtain Neotoma data, including the Explorer map-based interface, an application programming interface, the neotoma R package, and digital object identifiers. As the volume and variety of scientific data grow, community-curated data resources such as Neotoma have become foundational infrastructure for big data science.",

        "abstract": "Shafer (2021) offers a betting perspective on statistical testing which may be useful for foundational debates, given that disputes over such testing continue to be intense. To be helpful for researchers, however, this perspective will need more elaboration using real examples in which (a) the betting score has a justification and interpretation in terms of study goals that distinguishes it from the uncountable mathematical possibilities, and (b) the assumptions in the sampling model are uncertain. On justification, Shafer says 'No one has made a convincing case for any particular choice' of a score derived from a P-value and then states that 'the choice is fundamentally arbitrary'. Yet some (but not most) scores can be motivated by study goals (e.g., information measurement; decision making). The one I have seen repeatedly in information statistics and data mining is the surprisal, logworth or S-value s = -log(p), where the log base determines the scale. The present comment explains the rationale for this choice.",

        "abstract": "Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel corona virus that causes corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19 rapidly spread across the nations with high mortality rate even as very little is known to contain the virus at present. In the current study, we report novel natural metabolites namely, ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid as the potential inhibitors against main protease (Mpro) of COVID-19 by using integrated molecular modeling approaches. From a combination of molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we found three ligands bound to protease during 50 ns of MD simulations. Furthermore, the molecular mechanic/generalized/Born/Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/G/P/BSA) free energy calculations showed that these chemical molecules have stable and favourable energies causing strong binding with binding site of Mpro protein. All these three molecules, namely, ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid, have passed the ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion) property as well as Lipinski’s rule of five. The study provides a basic foundation and suggests that the three phytochemicals, viz. ursolic acid, carvacrol and oleanolic acid could serve as potential inhibitors in regulating the Mpro protein’s function and controlling viral replication.

        "abstract": "While service design has been highlighted as a promising approach for driving innovation, there are often struggles in realizing lasting change in practice. The issues with long-term implementation reveal a reductionist view of service design that ignores the institutional arrangements and other interdependencies that influence design efforts within multi-actor service systems. The purpose of this article is to build a systemic understanding of service design to inform actors’ efforts aimed at intentional, long-term change in service systems. To achieve this aim, we inform the conceptual building blocks of service design by applying service-dominant logic’s service ecosystems perspective. Through this process, we develop four core propositions and a multilevel process model of service ecosystem design. The conceptualization of service ecosystem design advances service design theory by illuminating previously taken for granted aspects; explaining how intentional, long-term change emerges; and expanding the scope of service design beyond projects. Furthermore, this research offers a foundation for future research on service design that involves extending the systemic conceptualization of service design, conducting more holistic empirical investigations, and developing practical methods and approaches for the embedded, collective processes of designing.",

While the direction of the dipole in the quasar sky is similar to that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), its amplitude is over twice as large as expected, rejecting the canonical, exclusively kinematic interpretation of the CMB dipole with a p-value of 5 × 10−7 (4.9σ for a normal distribution, one-sided), the highest significance achieved to date in such studies.

The statistical distributions natively available on quantum processors are a superset of those available classically. Harnessing this attribute has the potential to accelerate or otherwise improve machine learning relative to purely classical performance. A key challenge toward that goal is learning to hybridize classical computing resources and traditional learning techniques with the emerging capabilities of general purpose quantum processors. Here, we demonstrate such hybridization by training a 19-qubit gate model processor to solve a clustering problem, a foundational challenge in unsupervised learning. We use the quantum approximate optimization algorithm in conjunction with a gradient-free Bayesian optimization to train the quantum machine. This quantum/classical hybrid algorithm shows robustness to realistic noise, and we find evidence that classical optimization can be used to train around both coherent and incoherent imperfections.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel model-free/data-driven centralized training and decentralized execution multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework for distribution system voltage control with high penetration of PVs. The proposed MADRL can coordinate both the real and reactive power control of PVs with existing static var compensators and battery storage systems. Unlike the existing DRL-based voltage control methods, our proposed method does not rely on a system model during both the training and execution stages. This is achieved by developing a new interaction scheme between the surrogate modeling of the original system and the multi-agent soft actor critic (MASAC) MADRL algorithm. In particular, the sparse pseudo-Gaussian process with a few-shots of measurements is utilized to construct the surrogate model of the original environment, i.e., power flow model. This is a data-driven process and no model parameters are needed. Furthermore, the MASAC enabled MADRL allows to achieve better scalability by dividing the original system into different voltage control regions with the aid of real and reactive power sensitivities to voltage, where each region is treated as an agent. This also serves as the foundation for the centralized training and decentralized execution, thus significantly reducing the communication requirements as only local measurements are required for control. Comparative results with other alternatives on the IEEE 123-nodes and 342-nodes systems demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.",

In particular, we invoke this framework to understand communal goal processes as proximal motivators of decisions to engage in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). STEM fields are not perceived as affording communal opportunities to work with or help others, and understanding these perceived goal affordances can inform knowledge about differences between (a) STEM and other career pathways and (b) women’s and men’s choices. We review the patterning of gender disparities in STEM that leads to a focus on communal goal congruity (Part I), provide evidence for the foundational logic of the perspective (Part II), and explore the implications for research and policy (Part III). Understanding and transmitting the opportunities for communal goal pursuit within STEM can reap widespread benefits for broadening and deepening participation.",

        "abstract": "In visual reasoning, the achievement of deep learning significantly improved the accuracy of results. Image features are primarily used as input to get answers. However, the image features are too redundant to learn accurate characterizations within a limited complexity and time. While in the process of human reasoning, abstract description of an image is usually to avoid irrelevant details. Inspired by this, a higher-level representation named semantic representation is introduced. In this paper, a detailed visual reasoning model is proposed. This new model contains an image understanding model based on semantic representation, feature extraction and process model refined with watershed and u-distance method, a feature vector learning model using pyramidal pooling and residual network, and a question understanding model combining problem embedding coding method and machine translation decoding method. The feature vector could better represent the whole image instead of overly focused on specific characteristics. The model using semantic representation as input verifies that more accurate results can be obtained by introducing a high-level semantic representation. The result also shows that it is feasible and effective to introduce high-level and abstract forms of knowledge representation into deep learning tasks. This study lays a theoretical and experimental foundation for introducing different levels of knowledge representation into deep learning in the future.",

        "abstract": "Microsatellite instability (MSI) has been approved as a pan-cancer biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. However, current MSI identification methods are not available for all patients. We proposed an ensemble multiple instance deep learning model to predict microsatellite status based on histopathology images, and interpreted the pathomics-based model with multi-omics correlation. Methods: Two cohorts of patients were collected, including 429 from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-COAD) and 785 from an Asian colorectal cancer (CRC) cohort (Asian-CRC). We established the pathomics model, named Ensembled Patch Likelihood Aggregation (EPLA), based on two consecutive stages: patch-level prediction and WSI-level prediction. The initial model was developed and validated in TCGA-COAD, and then generalized in Asian-CRC through transfer learning. The pathological signatures extracted from the model were analyzed with genomic and transcriptomic profiles for model interpretation. Results: The EPLA model achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.8848 (95% CI: 0.8185-0.9512) in the TCGA-COAD test set and an AUC of 0.8504 (95% CI: 0.7591-0.9323) in the external validation set Asian-CRC after transfer learning. Notably, EPLA captured the relationship between pathological phenotype of poor differentiation and MSI (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the five pathological imaging signatures identified from the EPLA model were associated with mutation burden and DNA damage repair related genotype in the genomic profiles, and antitumor immunity activated pathway in the transcriptomic profiles. Conclusions: Our pathomics-based deep learning model can effectively predict MSI from histopathology images and is transferable to a new patient cohort. The interpretability of our model by association with pathological, genomic and transcriptomic phenotypes lays the foundation for prospective clinical trials of the application of this artificial intelligence (AI) platform in ICB therapy.",

        "title": "Medicine as a Community of Practice: Implications for Medical Education.",
        "abstract": "The presence of a variety of independent learning theories makes it difficult for medical educators to construct a comprehensive theoretical framework for medical education, resulting in numerous and often unrelated curricular, instructional, and assessment practices. Linked with an understanding of identity formation, the concept of communities of practice could provide such a framework, emphasizing the social nature of learning. Individuals wish to join the community, moving from legitimate peripheral to full participation, acquiring the identity of community members and accepting the community's norms.Having communities of practice as the theoretical basis of medical education does not diminish the value of other learning theories. Communities of practice can serve as the foundational theory, and other theories can provide a theoretical basis for the multiple educational activities that take place within the community, thus helping create an integrated theoretical approach.Communities of practice can guide the development of interventions to make medical education more effective and can help both learners and educators better cope with medical education's complexity. An initial step is to acknowledge the potential of communities of practice as the foundational theory. Educational initiatives that could result from this approach include adding communities of practice to the cognitive base; actively engaging students in joining the community; creating a welcoming community; expanding the emphasis on explicitly addressing role modeling, mentoring, experiential learning, and reflection; providing faculty development to support the program; and recognizing the necessity to chart progress toward membership in the community.",

        "abstract": "Anthracnose, brown spot, mites, black rot, downy mildew, and leaf blight are six common grape leaf pests and diseases, which cause severe economic losses to the grape industry. Timely diagnosis and accurate identification of grape leaf diseases are decisive for controlling the spread of disease and ensuring the healthy development of the grape industry. This paper proposes a novel recognition approach that is based on improved convolutional neural networks for the diagnoses of grape leaf diseases. First, based on 4,023 images collected in the field and 3,646 images collected from public data sets, a data set of 107,366 grape leaf images is generated via image enhancement techniques. Afterward, Inception structure is applied for strengthening the performance of multi-dimensional feature extraction. In addition, a dense connectivity strategy is introduced to encourage feature reuse and strengthen feature propagation. Ultimately, a novel CNN-based model, namely, DICNN, is built and trained from scratch. It realizes an overall accuracy of 97.22% under the hold-out test set. Compared to GoogLeNet and ResNet-34, the recognition accuracy increases by 2.97% and 2.55%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can efficiently recognize grape leaf diseases. Meanwhile, this study explores a new approach for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of plant diseases that establishes a theoretical foundation for the application of deep learning in the field of agricultural information.",

        "title": "Informal Caregiver Burnout? Development of a Theoretical Framework to Understand the Impact of Caregiving",
        "abstract": "Informal caregiving is a rewarding but demanding role. The present theoretical framework proposes to adapt the tridimensional concept of burnout to informal caregiving as a way to address the potential consequences of caregiving. This adaptation reflects caregivers’ reported difficulties, as well as empirical findings on emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment as caregiving outcomes. But to understand burnout in informal caregiving contexts, it is also necessary to find ways to model it. The Informal Caregiving Integrative Model (ICIM) is thus proposed. This model is based on the integration of elements from literature on both informal caregiving stress and professional burnout. The goal of the ICIM is to emphasize the importance of every category of determinants of informal caregiver burnout (i.e., relating to the caregiver, the caregiving setting, and the sociocultural context), with a key mediating role for the caregivers’ appraisal of their situation and their relationship with the care-recipient. This article is a first integrative step in the consideration of a form of burnout specific to informal caregivers and supports the design of empirical and interventional studies based on the theoretical foundation that the ICIM proposes.",

        "abstract": "Researchers have uncovered inconsistent relations between anxiety and performance. Although the prominent view is a “dark side,” where anxiety has a negative relation with performance, a “bright side” of anxiety has also been suggested. We reconcile past findings by presenting a comprehensive multilevel, multiprocess model of workplace anxiety called the theory of workplace anxiety (TWA). This model highlights the processes and conditions through which workplace anxiety may lead to debilitative and facilitative job performance and includes 19 theoretical propositions. Drawing on past theories of anxiety, resource depletion, cognitive-motivational processing, and performance, we uncover the debilitative and facilitative nature of dispositional and situational workplace anxiety by positioning emotional exhaustion, self-regulatory processing, and cognitive interference as distinct contrasting processes underlying the relationship between workplace anxiety and job performance. Extending our theoretical model, we pinpoint motivation, ability, and emotional intelligence as critical conditions that shape when workplace anxiety will debilitate and facilitate job performance. We also identify the unique employee, job, and situational characteristics that serve as antecedents of dispositional and situational workplace anxiety. The TWA offers a nuanced perspective on workplace anxiety and serves as a foundation for future work.",

Because of these features, it has inspired most of the existing top-level ontologies and has been used to develop or improve standards and public domain resources (e.g. CIDOC CRM, DBpedia and WordNet). Being a foundational ontology, dolce is not directly concerned with domain knowledge. Its purpose is to provide the general categories and relations needed to give a coherent view of reality, to integrate domain knowledge, and to mediate across domains. In these 20 years dolce has shown that applied ontologies can be stable and that interoperability across reference and domain ontologies is a reality.

Recently, for example, they have collaborated in putting together an integrated alternative model (Douglas Fir Group, 2016) to move theory and pedagogy forward. Shifting further yet toward the material locus and spatiotemporal conditioning of communication, this article reports on the communicative practices of international STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) scholars. Its data analysis uses a spatial orientation informed by schools such as new materialism, post‐humanism, and actor network theory, influenced largely by scholars in material and spatial sciences. The article calls for a fuller materialization, embodiment, and performativity in theorizing language competence than currently conceptualized in applied linguistics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",

        "abstract": "Abstract Efficient S phase entry is essential for development, tissue repair, and immune defences. However, hyperactive or expedited S phase entry causes replication stress, DNA damage and oncogenesis, highlighting the need for strict regulation. Recent paradigm shifts and conflicting reports demonstrate the requirement for a discussion of the G1/S transition literature. Here, we review the recent studies, and propose a unified model for the S phase entry decision. In this model, competition between mitogen and DNA damage signalling over the course of the mother cell cycle constitutes the predominant control mechanism for S phase entry of daughter cells. Mitogens and DNA damage have distinct sensing periods, giving rise to three Commitment Points for S phase entry (CP1-3). S phase entry is mitogen-independent in the daughter G1 phase, but remains sensitive to DNA damage, such as single strand breaks, the most frequently-occurring lesions that uniquely threaten DNA replication. To control CP1-3, dedicated hubs integrate the antagonistic mitogenic and DNA damage signals, regulating the stoichiometric cyclin: CDK inhibitor ratio for ultrasensitive control of CDK4/6 and CDK2. This unified model for the G1/S cell cycle transition combines the findings of decades of study, and provides an updated foundation for cell cycle research.",

        "abstract": "The problem of defining “child sexual abuse” (CSA), and the need to define this concept, has been recognized by major policy bodies and leading researchers since the 1970s. Recent demands for a more theoretically robust, explicit definition of CSA show this challenge remains urgent. In this article, we identify problems caused by variance in definitions of CSA for five domains: research and knowledge formation, legal frameworks and principles, prevention efforts, policy responses, and the establishment of social norms. We review and analyze definitions used in leading international epidemiological studies, national and international policy documents, social science literature, and legal systems in the United States, Canada, and Australia to demonstrate the continuing use of different concepts of CSA and identify key areas of conceptual disagreement. Informed by our literature review, we use a methodology of conceptual analysis to develop a conceptual model of CSA. The purpose of this model is to propose a more robust, theoretically sound concept of CSA, which clarifies its defining characteristics and distinguishes it from other concepts. Finally, we provide operational examples of the conceptual model to indicate how it would translate to a classificatory framework of typologies of acts and experiences. A sound conceptual model and classificatory system offers the prospect of more appropriate and effective methods of research, response, regulation, and prevention. While total consensus is unattainable, this analysis may assist in developing understanding and advancing more coherent approaches to the conceptual foundation of CSA and its operationalization.",

Various fields are employing the concept of IoT for their traditional products and services for convenient use by consumers. In the construction industry, the majority of leading companies and organizations are using IoT technologies in a smart home environment. However, only few studies have focused on the user experience of IoT technologies in such an environment. Thus, the current study explores the key determinants of user acceptance of IoT technologies in a smart home environment, and investigates a research model integrated with five potential user factors and a technology acceptance model. The results of the collected data, which were investigated using a structural equation modeling method, show that three positive motivations, compatibility, connectedness, and control, and a negative hindrance, cost, are significant determinants of the technology acceptance behavior of users. The current study can serve as a foundation for future studies on improving IoT technologies in a smart home environment by considering the user experience.",

Benefits of threat intelligence include improved efficiency and effectiveness in security operations in terms of detective and preventive capabilities.

This purpose is served by the use of taxonomies, sharing standards, and ontologies.This paper introduces the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) model, which enables cyber defenders to explore their threat intelligence capabilities and understand their position against the ever-changing cyber threat landscape. In addition, we use our model to analyze and evaluate several existing taxonomies, sharing standards, and ontologies relevant to cyber threat intelligence. Our results show that the cyber security community lacks an ontology covering the complete spectrum of threat intelligence. To conclude, we argue the importance of developing a multi-layered cyber threat intelligence ontology based on the CTI model and the steps should be taken under consideration, which are the foundation of our future work.",

Predicting the magnitude of this impact urgently requires an understanding of the process connecting atmospheric drying to plant tissue damage. Recent episodes of forest mortality worldwide have been widely attributed to dry conditions causing acute damage to plant vascular systems. Under this scenario vascular embolisms produced by water stress are thought to cause plant death, yet this hypothetical trajectory has never been empirically demonstrated. Here we provide foundational evidence connecting failure in the vascular network of leaves with tissue damage caused during water stress. We observe a catastrophic sequence initiated by water column breakage under tension in leaf veins which severs local leaf tissue water supply, immediately causing acute cellular dehydration and irreversible damage. By highlighting the primacy of vascular network failure in the death of leaves exposed to drought or evaporative stress our results provide a strong mechanistic foundation upon which models of plant damage in response to dehydration can be confidently structured.",

The second step was to characterize the circuit’s response characteristic to different amounts of circadian light from threshold to saturation. By doing so a more complete instantaneous photometric quantity representing the circadian stimulus was defined in terms of both the spectral sensitivity and the response magnitude characteristic of the circadian phototransduction circuit. To validate the model of the circadian phototransduction circuit, it was necessary to augment the model to account for different durations of the circadian stimulus and distribution of the circadian stimulus across the retina. Two simple modifications to the model accounted for the duration and distribution of continuous light exposure during the early biological night. A companion paper (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.615305/full) provides a neurophysiological foundation for the model parameters.",

        "title": "Federated Knowledge Distillation",
        "abstract": "Distributed learning frameworks often rely on exchanging model parameters across workers, instead of revealing their raw data. A prime example is federated learning that exchanges the gradients or weights of each neural network model. Under limited communication resources, however, such a method becomes extremely costly particularly for modern deep neural networks having a huge number of model parameters. In this regard, federated distillation (FD) is a compelling distributed learning solution that only exchanges the model outputs whose dimensions are commonly much smaller than the model sizes (e.g., 10 labels in the MNIST dataset). The goal of this chapter is to provide a deep understanding of FD while demonstrating its communication efficiency and applicability to a variety of tasks. To this end, towards demystifying the operational principle of FD, the first part of this chapter provides a novel asymptotic analysis for two foundational algorithms of FD, namely knowledge distillation (KD) and co-distillation (CD), by exploiting the theory of neural tangent kernel (NTK). Next, the second part elaborates on a baseline implementation of FD for a classification task, and illustrates its performance in terms of accuracy and communication efficiency compared to FL. Lastly, to demonstrate the applicability of FD to various distributed learning tasks and environments, the third part presents two selected applications, namely FD over asymmetric uplink-and-downlink wireless channels and FD for reinforcement learning.",
